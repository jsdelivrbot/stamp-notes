\chapter{Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Hungary}



\section{First Stamp Issues}

Following the ‘stampless’ era, Austria joined the stamp-issuing nations of the world in 1850. Austrian issues used in Hungary are much sought after by Hungarian philatelists. In 1867 a compromise was reached with Austria, creating the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy under Emperor Franz Josef. The Hungarian half of the Monarchy organized an independent postal system, which issued its first stamps in 1867. Since then, its stamp issues have reflected the country’s current and past history. Many Hungarian stamps depict two national symbols – the crown of St. Stephen and the mythical Turul bird. During the First World War, Hungary fought alongside Austria against Russia and Italy.Austrian military-post stamps, as well as the stamps of Bosnia-Herzegovina (occupied in 1878 and annexed by the Monarchy in 1908) provide an interesting connection to Hungarian philately.\footnote{

\section{1946-1980} 

Stamps issued between 1946 and 1980 are not only interesting because they reflect Hungary's post war history, but also because they are beautiful for their choice of themes. Since 1980 the Hungarian Postal Authorities have curtailed their annual output and now produce some of the best designed and printed stamps in the world.

Imperforate stamps before 1946 are usually printer's waste and were never issued as such. From 1946 to 1991 the Post Office issued a small quantity of all issues in imperforate form. These were sold only to members of the National Stamp Club at five times the face value. They are widely collected and some are in short supply. They were all valid for postage, and still are.
