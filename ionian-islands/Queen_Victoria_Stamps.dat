\chapter{The Queen Victoria Stamps}

The rarest used stamps of Europe used as wallpaper in mint condition.

The color scheme of these stamps was originally to be the same as for the contemporary British postage stamps, red for the 1p and blue for the 2p. But the stamps were actually issued in reversed order. The \halfp stamp was printed in yellow, a colour which was not used for the classic stamps of Great Britain.
