Prior to the French Revolutionary Wars, the {{wi:Ionian_Islands}} had been part of the Republic of Venice. With the dissolution of that polity under the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio, it was annexed into the French Republic. Between 1798 and 1799, the French were driven out by a joint Russo-Turkish force. The occupying forces founded the {{wi:Septinsular_Republic}}, which lasted from 1800 until 1807.

The Ionian Islands were then re-annexed by the French into the Illyrian Provinces. In 1809, the United Kingdom defeated the French fleet off Zakynthos on 2 October, and captured Kefalonia, Kythira, and Zakynthos. The British took Lefkada in 1810. Corfu remained under French rule until 1814.

The Congress of Vienna agreed to place the Ionian Islands under the exclusive protection of the United Kingdom. Despite British military administration, the Austrian Empire was guaranteed commercial status equal to the UK. The arrangement was solidifed with the ratification of the 'Maitland constitution' on 26 August 1817, which created a federation of the seven islands.

On 29 March 1864, the United Kingdom, Greece, France, and Russia signed the Treaty of London, pledging the transfer of sovereignty to Greece upon ratification. Thus, on 28 May, by proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, the Ionian Islands were united with Greece.[5]

The evacuation of the Ionian Islands was completed by 2nd June, 1864, at midday. Sir H.K.Storks wrote
his last despatch as Lord High Commissioner on that morning and closed an eventful epoch of its
history by stating:

\begin{quotation}
It is impossible to look back to British rule in these islands which has lasted half a century
without being convinced that England has dealt generously with the Ionians and faithfully
discharged the arduous and responsible duties she accepted in 1815.
\end{quotation}

And that was the finale of British rule.
