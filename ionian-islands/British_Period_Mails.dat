\chapter{British Post Office}    

In July, 1857, a "Law establishing a new Tariff for the postage of letters, in 
lieu of the present rates"* of which the following is a copy, was passed by 
'the legislature\cite{Bacon 183} :—

ON 23rd June, 1857, Sir John Young, the Lord High Commissioner
of the Ionian Islands, spent some considerable time
reading certain papers sent to him by Mr. Fels,---the Agent in
the Islands for Messrs. Bibby's Liverpool S.S. Co., which
papers urged that postage stamps would be an advantage,
coupled with a low rate of postage.

His Excellency dallied with this proposition, and drafted a letter to his Senate
advocating the proposal, but finally decided not to inform the Senate, but give
the matter more mature consideration before he took any further steps with
regard to postage stamps, or reduced rates of postage.

Within a few days Sir John Young received such complaints of the conduct
of the Post Office at Corfu that the matter again pressed itself on his immediate
attention, so that on 3rd July, 1857, ne through Sir G. F. Bowen, his own private
secretary, addressed the following letter to the Secretary of the Senate :

\begin{blockquote}[shadow]

[C.O. 136 : 1177.] [CORFU],<br/>
3 July, 1857.<br/>

SIR,<br/>

I am directed by the Lord High Commissioner to recommend to the consideration
of the Senate the enclosed letter concerning the Post Office at Corfu. The
complaints of neglect and omission of duty in this Department are frequent and
serious, and it seems to be underhanded.

<p>
The Lord High Commissioner recommends the Senate to consider if it would not
be desirable to adopt in these islands the system adopted with so great success in
England, France and all the principal States of Europe (viz. uniform rates of postage,
effected by means of prepayment and stamps). Should the Senate adopt the principle,
the Lord High Commissioner will cause a specific proposition to be made on the
subject.</p>


<p>
(Sg.) GEORGE F. BOWEN,<br/>
Secretary to the Lord High Commissioner.
</p>
\end{blockquote}

On i6th July, 1857, Sir John Young sent the Senate a copy of a letter from
his Director-General of the Posts enclosing a proposal " for a reform of the Postal
tariff of these States." 

Sir J. Young considered additional accommodation and
convenience to the public arising from the proposed change would far outweigh
the loss to Revenue. " Increased facilities," Bowen wrote on behalf of Sir
J. Young to the Senate, " should be given. In England to make the system of
a uniform penny postage work well thousands of branch offices were established
in all parts of the country with additional deliveries in all the large towns. His
Excellency thinks that a penny post should be established to Lefchimo and to

Castrades, or some other part in the north of Corfu. No additional expense of
any importance need be incurred, for the letters could be carried by the messengers
that deliver judicial writs, and the police stations can be made post offices. If
this system is found to work well in Corfu it can be extended to the other islands.
(Sg.) Bowen." (C.O. 136 : 1177.) The Senate who were then in session did, on
27th July, 1857, pass a Postal Act on the lines His Excellency suggested.
It provided for a reduced tariff on letters being \ oz. letter, id.; i oz., 2d.;
2 oz., 4d. ; and Art. 2 stated : " A postage stamp, in conformity with the new
rates, shall be established by the Government for the convenience of the public,"*
This Postal Act came into force in 1857, although no postage stamps were
issued till 1859.

Sir G. Bowen in writing to the Board of Directors of the Austrian Lloyd Co.,
Trieste, on I7th October, 1857, states : " The Ionian Government . . . has
introduced a low and uniform rate of postage as will be seen by the enclosed
Act. . . . It is expected that the number of letters passing through the Post
Office under the new system will increase very materially as experience has
proved elsewhere. . . ." (C.O. 136: 1177.)

Again, on commenting on the Blue Book of 1857 Sir G. F. Bowen stated:
" There is a decrease of £162 in the Post Office Revenue, chiefly arising, as was
the case at first in England, from the introduction in 1857 of a uniform Penny
Postage in the Ionian Islands." (C.O. 136 : 161.) And, finally, Bowen replied
to Captain Lawrence, Director-General of Zante, on 3rd October, 1857:
" . . . Respecting the late new Postage Act . . . all letters must be prepaid or
double taxed." (C.O, 136 : 1177.)

Having passed this Act the matter of providing postage stamps would seem
to have remained in abeyance for a year, as I find the next material letter is dated
3rd May, 1858, when Sir G. F. Bowen addressed the following letter to James
Hunter who was the Colonial Agent in London for the Ionian Islands :

\begin{quotation}
[C.O. 136 : 1178.]
MY DEAR HUNTER,
The Ionian Government has determined on adopting a uniform rate of
postage and stamps according to the English model. Consequently I am directed by
the Lord High Commissioner to request you to inform me what course has been adopted
by Ceylon, and the other Colonial Governments, which have also adopted the English
system. Have they procured from England a machine for making the stamps in the
Colony, and if so what would be the cost of a machine for that purpose to be sent out
to Corfu.
Probably we should want only one penny and twopenny stamps. They would
have the Queen's head with the Greek words IOXIKON KPATOi, like the small
coinage and the value one penny and twopence. However, I will send you a drawing
of the proposed stamps, when I receive the preliminary information. Pray let me hear
at your convenience all the hints and suggestions which may be useful. Also, if
possible, specimens of the postage stamps used in other British dependencies.

(Sg.) G. F. BOWEN.
26 May, 1858

\end{quotation}

MY DEAR HUNTER,

I have your letter of the I7th inst. enclosing a communication from Messrs.
* Mr. F. J. Melville in his excellent article on "The Stamps of the Ionian Isles " (Stamp
Lover, August-September, 1925), gave further particulars of this Act. This Postal Act was
inserted in the Ionian Gazette.
Perkins, Bacon & Co. of Fleet St. on the subject of the postage stamps required by
the Ionian Government.

The Lord High Commissioner has decided that we want only two denominations
of stamps, viz. id. and 2d., and that they shall be the same in size, colours, etc., as
the stamps of the same value used in England with the exception that the Greek
words IONIKON KPATOS shall be put round the Queen's head.

As so small a difference is required in the moulds used in England the Lord High
Commissioner thinks that the other preliminary expense should be trifling in comparison
with what would be asked for entirely new devices.

Messrs. Perkins, Bacon \& Co. will be contracted with for the manufacture of the
stamps and for sending them out to Corfu periodically. Meantime I am to request
you to get them to send out a specimen of the stamps of both kinds with the Greek
words as above, and a statement of the terms on which they will engage to supply
the Ionian Government with them (let us say) per 1000. On receipt of those specimens
and this statement a final settlement will be made.
(Sg.) G. F. BOWEN

It is known that Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. did on 8th June, 1858, in reply
to Mr. James Hunter's enquiry, inform Mr. Hunter : " If a plain paper and one
with the figures i and 2 is adopted, there would be no charge for paper moulds.
. . . And they [i.e. the postage stamps] can be printed in Red, Blue or any other
colour which may be desired." I can add that Mr. Hunter on nth June enclosed
this estimate from Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. to the Lord High Commissioner,
and his reply (28th June, 1858) was as Mr. Melville has stated :
[C.O. 136 : 1178.]
ist. The paper to be adopted is that with the figures i and 2 as a watermark as
proposed by Messrs. Perkins & Co. in their estimate.
2nd. The penny stamps are to be red, and the twopenny stamps blue. The denominations
(id. and 2d.) are not to be placed upon them, as the colour will be a sufficient
distinction.
3rd. The device is to be simply a Queen's head with the Greek words IONIKON
KPATOi' on a garter (if that be the proper term) round it, as, for example, in
the New South Wales stamp herewith returned. No other words or devices
whatsoever are to be employed.
4th. The Lord High Commissioner hopes that great care will be taken to make the
Queen's head as perfect as possible as a work of art ; in short, as like as possible
to the Queen's heads on the English postage stamps.
5th. It is desirable that fifty thousand stamps of each colour shall be sent out as
soon as ready. Experience will soon show in what numbers and proportion they
will be required afterwards.
6th. [Stamps to be sent out by Liverpool S.S. (Messrs. Bibby) or whatever the readiest
means of communication with the Ionian Islands.]
Pray transmit this letter to Messrs. Perkins & Co. and let me know when we may
expect the first batch of stamps.
(Sg.) G. F. BOWEN.
These instructions were duly carried out by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co.,
who despatched on 3rd November, 1858 :—

On 4th December, 1858, the Governor sent the Senate the account for these
postage stamps amounting to £89 175. 11d., requesting the necessary
should be given to the Ionian Treasury to defray the cost. On loth December,
1858, Sir J. Young enclosed for the Senate's favourable consideration documents
relating to the proposed new arrangements of the Post Office, and if approved
" will cause them to be put in force as soon as possible."
However, a need arose for a halfpenny stamp, and Sir G. F. Bowen wrote to
Hunter :
[€.0.136: 1178.] CORFU,
22 January, 1859.
MY DEAR HUNTER,
With reference to our former correspondence about postage stamps for the
Ionian Islands I am directed by the Lord High Commissioner to state that we require '
an halfpenny also which is to be of exactly the same size and pattern as those already
sent, only yellow. Pray have the same number of yellow stamps sent out as soon as
possible as you have already sent out of red.
(Sg.) G. F. BOWEN.
These halfpenny stamps, which were printed on paper without watermark,
were despatched on 5th March, 1859, ar>d invoiced at £2 igs. 5d.
All was at last ready for issuing these long-delayed postage stamps, and on
behalf of the Lord High Commissioner the Senate was informed :
To the Secretary of the Senate. 26 March, 1859.
SIR,
I am directed by the Lord High Commissioner to transmit to you for submission
to the Senate and for such observations as that most illustrious body may have
to offer, the enclosed notification of the Director-General of the Post Office respecting
the measures to be adopted for the circulation and use of the Postal stamps received
from England.
(Sg.) E. L. BARR,
Acting Sec. to Lord High Commissioner.
M. Nathalie Rondot stated definitely " that the system of franking letters by
means of postage stamps came into force in the Ionian Islands on I5th May,
1859." • • • This date, in the absence of any known copy of the Postal notice
prescribed by the Act, has been taken as probably correct. (Vide Stamp Lover,
August-September, 1925, p. 61.)
On 30th April, 1859, the Secretary of the Senate was informed : "I have the
honour to transmit to you for submission to the Senate the accompanying letter
received from the Director-General of the Zante respecting the sale of postage
stamps and which it is proposed to publish in the next Ionian official Gazette
should the Senate concur."
In the Colonial Office files of the Ionian Gazettes the year 1859 appears to be
missing, so I am unable to trace whether the issue of these stamps was inserted
in the Ionian Gazette.
As Mr. Melville states, the allocation of the three colours to the three denominations
has at times been a subject of controversy. For some reason, or
through a misunderstanding, the values of the red and blue stamps were reversed,
the red stamp being issued and used as a 2d. denomination, and the blue as a
id. stamp. This has long been established from covers of letters and was known
to M. Rondot when he wrote in 1864 in the Magasin Pittoresque.
I can add that when Sir H. K. Storks was requested by the Duke of Newcastle
to supply Ionian Islands postage stamps for the International Exhibition of
1862, he replied:

[C.O. 136 : 175.]
No. 190. CORFU,
19 Dec. 1861.
MY LORD DUKE,
. . . I have the honour to enclose specimens of the postage stamps used in
these States. The yellow ones are of one halfpenny, the blue ones of one penny and
the red of two pence each.
The Duke of Newcastle, K.G.,
Downing Street. (Sg.) H. K. STORKS.
On iyth February, 1859, Sir Henry K. Storks succeeded Sir John Young as
Lord High Commissioner and Sir G. F. Bowen was appointed Governor of Queensland.
Sir H. K. Storks speedily appointed a Commission for the examination of
the Public Departments in Corfu.
This Commission presented their report in September, 1860, and under the
" Post Office " do not mention the newly issued stamps :
POST OFFICE.
The Commission remarked that : " There is a Register of the letters delivered by
this office to the Austrian Lloyd establishment, and that receipts are given for such
letters. . . . The Commission expressed much surprise on finding that it was customary
for the Post Office to be closed 3, 4 or even 5 hours before departure of the steamer—
a system that must cause great inconvenience . . . the Post Office should receive
letters until one hour previous to the steamer's departure. . . . The Postmaster in
Corfu should be placed on a par with the Postmasters of Cephalonia and Zante, as
the regular arrival and departure of steamers at Corfu amount to 76 every month,
whilst those of Cephalonia and Zante do not exceed 38."
Sir H. K. Storks did not approve of the postal policy of his predecessor, Sir
J. Young, for in his opening speech to the Senate on roth December, 1859, he
informed them that amongst the Bills prepared for their acceptance was : " (8) To
abolish the Postal tariff now established and to return to the old system." (C.O.
136 : 166. In the Gazette^ Since the reduction of the postal rates in 1857 the
postal revenue had steadily diminished :
i s. d.
1856 . . . 2616 8 o
1857 • • • 2454 2 O
1858 . . . 1125 4 ii
1859 • • • I073 8 ii
The Commission to enquire into the financial condition of the Ionian States
recommended (agth September, 1860) that the old Postal tariff be restored :
and such was evidently Sir H. K. Storks' intention, as he speaks in December,
1861, of " an alteration which had diminished the revenue of the Post Office
was to be cancelled," and it was further his intention that the Post Office should
bring in an annual income of £1500.
I find, however, no evidence that the old postal rates were restored.
The Ionian Islands had not many sources of revenue.
Sir H. K. Storks wrote on 23rd December, 1861 :
From a man who lives in his own house, and on the produce of his own land,
spinning his own wool, and drinking his own wine, and smoking his own tobacco, the
State receives no contribution save the small duty on salt, on gunpowder if he uses it,
and the stamp on receipts if not evaded."
And there is a Colonial Office minute on a despatch, early in 1862 : " It is quite
cheering to hear anything bright from the Ionian Islands."

Prior to 1857 a vessel of war was employed in conveying mails once a month
between Malta and Corfu. When this vessel was withdrawn the G.P.O. made
arrangements for despatching ship letter mails to the Ionian Islands by the private
steamers which left Liverpool three times a month, usually about the 6th, i6th
and 26th inst., for Corfu. These ship letter mails were made up principally for
the transmission of soldiers' and sailors' letters and of books and newspapers.
The general correspondence for the Ionian Islands was forwarded as a rule via
Trieste, but any letters the public desired to send by ship from Liverpool were
so forwarded, if specially so addressed. Postage in all cases had to be paid in
advance.*
The rates of postage were :
CORFU,
19 June, 1856.
(Sg.) E. F. BARR,
Acting Director-General.
Mails were also forwarded to and from the Ionian Islands by way of Italy, being
carried between Ancona and Corfu by Italian mail packets twice a month, until
the year 1864 when they ran a weekly packet. Mails containing paid and unpaid
letters were also exchanged via Messina between Malta and Corfu. This postal
route was mainly maintained for military purposes. Heavier mail and parcels
almost universally went from Liverpool (Messrs. Bibby) to Corfu. The local
mails were taken by the Islands' Government steamer. The mails from England
and Malta were delivered to Mr. Edward Barr, for many years the Agent at
Corfu of the G.P.O., London, and he made up the return mails for England and
Malta and was responsible for such portion of the British and Italian postage as
was collected in the Islands on the letters and mail papers.
Mr. Barr accounted to the G.P.O., London, for the Italian share of the postage
collected in the Ionian Islands and debited them with the Ionian postage which
had to be collected in Italy. The local Ionian postmasters accounted only with
Mr. Barr and had no direct relations with the G.P.O., London, or with the Post
Office of Italy. (C.O. 136 : 185. Stanley of Alderney (G.P.O.) to the Treasury,
3rd May, 1864.)
Sir H. K. Storks, who devoted some attention to the working of the Post
Office at Corfu, spoke highly of the respectability and integrity of the Postmaster
and his assistants.
" The constant robbery of letters," wrote Sir H. K. Storks to the Duke of Newcastle
on I5th December, 1862, " conveyed by way of Trieste and the practice which

prevails in Austria of opening letters are notorious. Few of Your Grace's despatches
arrive without bearing the marks of having been tampered with. The letters arrive
in many instances but with the contents abstracted."

When the connection between Great Britain and the Ionian Islands was
coming to an end Mr. Cardwell of the Treasury saw no reason why the Postal
Convention of this country with Italy relative to communications between
Ancona and Corfu, and also between Malta and Corfu via Messina, should be
kept on foot. There was no Postal Convention between the United Kingdom and
Greece, the amount of correspondence being very small.

The evacuation of the Ionian Islands was completed by 2nd June, 1864, at
midday. Sir H. K. Storks wrote his last despatch as Lord High Commissioner
on that morning and closed an eventful epoch of its history by stating :
"It is impossible to look back to British rule in these islands which has lasted
nearly half a century without being convinced that England has dealt generously
with the lonians and faithfully discharged the arduous and responsible duties she
accepted in 1815."

And that was the finale.
