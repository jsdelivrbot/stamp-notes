\chapter{Venetian Period}




Many letters have survived from the Venetian period and a large correspondence is in the archives. Letters are mostly as expected from officials and later on from the many venetian merchants that at the time dominated the trade in the merranean area. They are difficult to read due to the particular Venetian dialect spoken at the time and for which very few scholars remain. The letter in \ref{counciloften} was addressed to the {{wi: Council of Ten}} by Captain Benedetto Pesaro, Supreme Commander of the Venetian Fleet.
\footnote{The monument to Benedetto Pesaro adorns the whole doorway that leads into the Sacristy of the church of Frari. Captain General of the Venetian fleet, he achieved great victories over the Turks, winning back the islands of Leucade and Cefalonia. He died in Corfu in 1503 and in his will asked to be buried in the Frari. The work was carried out on his death by Lorenzo and Giambattista Bregno.
