\chapter{The Traveling Post Offices}

"The following potted history of the T.P.O.'s on the Demerara River 
will, I hope, clear up the query which was raised at our meeting in 
October 1956 in relation to the cancellations of this service. 

The T.P.O. on the Demerara River, strictly the Lower Demerara 
River to distinguish it from the launch service on the Upper Demerara 
River, was established on 1st March 1881 and originally ran from 
Georgetown to Lucky Spot on the Upper Demerara River just above 
Wismar, the present terminus and to which point it ran from 1901 and 
where a post office was opened on 4th May 1897. The Post Office 
Guide for 1884 recorded the times of departure and arrival and stated 
that mails for Mallali and places above Lucky Spot were conveyed by 
special mail boat. Since 1881 six different types of cancellation have 
been used by this T.P.O. 

The Mail Boat service on the Upper Demerara River was established 
on an experimental basis on 1st July 1881 between Lucky Spot and 
Mallali on which day a Post Office was opened at the latter settlement. 
The launch service was discontinued from 1st April 1882 as the 
Contractor was unable to perform the service at the rates agreed. Postal 
matter for places beyond Lucky Spot was retained in the custody of the 
Mail Officer on board the River Steamer and could be obtained on 
application. The service was re-established on October 1st 1883, the 
first T.P. Agent being Wm. Forsythe who conveyed the mails in a 
canvas collapsible boat. By July 1st 1885 the renewed contract for the 
mail service to Mallali operated from Akaima which by that time had 
become the terminus of the Demerara River Steamer service. In 1887 
the T.P. Agent was a coloured St. Lucian named Heshbon who used a 
similar type of collapsible boat. 

The designation of the service changed in 1896 from Mail Boat 
Demerara River to Upper Demerara River Launch although this is not 
reflected in the cancellation used. Because of lack of transport facilities 
the mail service between Wismar and Mulluli was discontinued from 22 
October 1st 1929 and postal business for the district was attended to 
from Wismar and Mackenzie Post Offices and the Postal Agency at 
Seba. The original cancellation is a 24 mm. D.R. with two line date and 
reads 'Mail Boat, Demerara River'. My own copies range from May 
17th 1888 to June 5th 1900. It was succeeded by a S.R. 28Â½ mm. type 
reading 'Mail Boat. B. Guiana' with three line date and I have copies 
between September 19th, 1902 and March 2nd, 1922. 

The T.P.A. service on the Upper Demerara River was re-established 
in February 1941 between Wismar and Mallali and Mr. Wreford 
Allicock was appointed T.P. Agent. I have no evidence to support the 
issue of a date stamp to the T.P.A. in 1941. Whether it has operated 
continuously since then is also not certain, but it was running in 1950. 
From enquiries made locally I have been informed that immediately 
prior to August 1952 the T.P.A. did not have its own cancellation. From 
that date however the rarely seen large S.R. 31 mm. type date stamp 
with single line date and asterisk below reading 'T.P.O. Upper Dem Riv. 
Br. Gu.' was brought into use."
