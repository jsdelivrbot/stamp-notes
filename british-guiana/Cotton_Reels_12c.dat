The 12 c. value was printed on black on blue, on indigo, on pale blue (shades). This and the 2c values are the only ones with known pairs. The stamp can be found with three varieties. The first variety is with a large figure " 2 " and straight foot. 12 c., pale blue. The copies are inevitably cancelled with the Berbice double-arc datestamp. The copy shown in Figure~\ref{lot55} is one of the better found. It is cut square with the outer frameline just touching. The stamp is catalogued both by Scott as well as Stanley Gibbons as No.5. On the Spinks sale in 2006 the stamp realized more than four times the low estimate that resulted in Gibbons revaluing the stamps in later editions of their catalogue.

Perhaps one of the finer copies is the one shown in Figure~\ref{lot56}. It is lightly cancelled and the printing distinct. It was initialled by E.D.W. and cancelled by a light Demerara double-arc datestamp. It was described by the auctioneer as "fine as can exist". The stamp was offered at an iitial estimate of $5,000-6,000 and sold for $11,000.
