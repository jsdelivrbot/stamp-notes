In this article I propose to deal with only one value—the 8 cents—but before doing so
it may perhaps not be without interest if I give a tabulated list of the "Circulars" that
were in the Ferrari Collection and those that are in the Tapling Collection, as the wealth
of these stamps in these two collections far surpasses any other collections that have been made, with the exception of the Philbrick Collection, and that was absorbed by Ferrari.

The 4 cents was issued, together with the 8 cents and 12 cents, on July 1, 1850. 

Figure~\ref{lot50} shows an 8c green, type Ai on medium wove paper that was once in the collection of Ferrary. It subsequent graced the collections of M. Burrus and the "Great". It was again offered for sale in 2006 by Spinks Shreves U.S.A. at an estimate US$ 8,000-10,000 and sold for $26,000. The sale had three other examples of the 8c and these are shown in Figures~\ref{lot51}, \ref{lot52} and \ref{lot53}. Lot 52 was described as: "an average example with heavy hinges on reverse, pinholes and thin spots, nevertheless a collectable example". The last one (Figure~\ref{lot53}) was in a poor condition, perhaps just a space-filler as the auctioneer described it, but within reach of the less affluent collector.

Most of the examples of the 8c cotton-reels are cut round. The condition of most of the surviving specimens is poor, as to be expected. I have not as yet seen a cover altough I know of a number of. 

The list is as follows:

                      &Ferrari        & Tapling\\
2 cents rose          &5 (inc. pairs) & 1\\
4 cents orange        &9              &5\\
4 cents pale yellow pelure paper  &5  &3\\
4 cents lemon-yellow              &5  &2\\
8 cents green                     &19 &12\\
12 cents blue (all three shades)  &33 (inc. pairs) &15 (inc. pairs)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The Webster Collection contained 16 "Circulars" and the Duveen Collection had 14
In the latter collection there was a cover franked by a 4 cents orange and an 8 cents green, the only instance, so far as I know, of two different values of the "Circulars" being used together.

The greatest numbers of Cottonreels to be available on the philatelic market were found in British Guiana between 1876 and 1878. A parcel of between three hundred and four hundred Cottonreels was bought by E. Stanley Gibbons from a correspondent in Georgetown. As is related in Fifty Years of Philately by Charles Phillips p.23 – written some fifteen years after he had bought the business from Stanley Gibbons – the bulk of the Cottonreels bought by Gibbons from British Guiana were the 12 cents blue, but there were amongst them some scores of 4 cents orange, a smaller number of 8 cents green, but no copy at all of the rare 2 cents rose.

The collection formed by Phillip La Rénotière von Ferrary was particularly rich in the Cottonreels, literally dozens of them, including two pairs and a single of the 2 cents (IV) and no fewer than five pairs of the 12 cents. Ferrary, an Austrian subject, fled from France to Switzerland after the outbreak of World War I, but he left most of his philatelic treasures in Paris. He died at Lausanne in 1917 and in his will he directed that his entire collection should be given to the Reichspost Museum at Berlin, to be put on exhibition forever. The French Government sequestered the collection, however, and offered it by auction at Paris in fourteen memorable sales at the Hotel Drouot between 23 June 1921 and 26 November 1925. The money thus raised, amounting to more than £400,000, was credited to the account of Germany’s war reparations.

In the Royal Collection there are twenty Cottonreels, including the first known pair of the 2 cents (V- VI) which had been found by E. C. Luard in 1888. One of the two known examples of the 4 cents on lemon paper cut square and two examples of the 12 cents in which the figure "2" has a straight instead of a curved foot. There are fifteen Cottonreels in the Tapling Collection in the British Library; they include the other 4 cents on lemon and a 2 cents (III). Thomas Keay Tapling, Member of Parliament and Vice-President of the (Royal) Philatelic Society, London, died on 6 April 1891 and bequeathed his collection to the British Museum. The collection was transferred to the British Library on its formation in 1973.

The collection of Alfred H. Caspary, auctioned by H.R. Harmer Inc. in New York, contained (in sale 5) three 4 cents, one 8 cents and four 12 cents Cottonreels.
