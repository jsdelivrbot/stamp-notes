\chapter{The Provisional Issue of 1888}


\newthought{The cause of this} issue was the passing by the Colonial Legislature of new
stamp taxes and the necessity to obtain the requisite stamps to meet the public demand
when the duties came into force.

The Official Gazette of 23rd May, 1888, published Ordinance No. 5 of 1888, Colonial
Taxes, the text of which (Section 38) reads:—


"On and after the first day of October, 1888, there shall be further raised in the manner
aforesaid the following duties of stamps; that is to say:—
Bankers Cheques:—On every cheque on any Bank or Banking Coy. in this colony
2 cents.

(Exemption:—Cheques drawn by the Receiver General or Assistant Receiver General
on Government account.)

(except a Bank Note) and Promissory Note of any kind whatsoever (except a
Bank Note) drawn or expressed to be payable or actually paid or endorsed or in any
manner negotiated within this colony.

For every sum not exceeding $24, 2 cents

(Exemptions:—All receipts given by the Receiver General, the Assistant Receiver
General or any Public Officer in the execution of his duty. All receipts given by
depositors on withdrawing money from any Government Savings Bank.)''


The Government addressed the following letter, dated 22nd June, 1888, to the Crown
Agents :—

\begin{letter}
"I have been directed by the Governor to inform you that it has been decided to levy
stamp duties in this Colony on cheques, bills of exchange, receipts and other documents
as.described in Ordinance 6 of 1888, a copy of which I enclose for your information.

2. As there are no revenue adhesive stamps or suitable stamp presses in the Colony
it is necessary to procure a full and complete supply from England, and I enclose, herewith, a requisition which has been framed by the Receiver General giving the numbers, values and designs of the several adhesive and impressed stamps which will be necessary. 

What
is required is a complete set of stamps, presses and apparatus generally, necessary to
carry out the provisions of the law in levying these stamp duties, and His Excellency
directs me to ask your kind assistance in the matter. . . . As these duties are leviable on
and after the 1st October, 1888, it is desirable that the utmost expedition should be used
in the matter.''
\end{letter}


The Crown Agents communicated with Messrs. De La Rue & Co. on the subject, and
the following correspondence ensued.

Messrs. De La Rue on 12th July, 1888, in a letter to the Crown Agents, state:

\begin{letter}
"We beg to confirm that it would take 10 weeks to complete the requisition for
adhesive stamps, and 4 months to complete the requisition for embossing dies and
presses. Under the circumstances it would appear that the only course will be to send a
supply of temporary stamps to cover all the duties of adhesive and embossed stamps
required, and we would suggest printing stamps in double fugitive purple from the British
Guiana postage plate for the cent series and in double fugitive green for the dollar series
and then overprinting them in black with the word 'Revenue' and the duty. If this plan
be adopted 15 overprint plates will suffice for the 30 duties required, viz.—1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40 and 72 cents and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 dollars, and the duties not provided for by these overprint plates could be made up as follows:— (here follows different combinations of the different values). We could send a supply of such stamps within a month, and we
shall be glad to receive your instructions as to what quantities of the various duties are
to be printed\ldots."
\end{letter}

On 13th July, 1888, the following telegram was despatched from the Crown Agents in
London:—

"Referring to your letter of 22nd June, can supply temporary stamps in a month;
permanent stamps not less than four months. Reply by telegraph.''
On 16th July the following reply was sent from this colony:—

'' Supply temporary.''

On 17th July, 1888, the Crown Agents addressed Messrs. De La Rue & Co.:—

"We approve the proposals contained in your letter of 12th inst, and request that you
will proceed as speedily as possible with the manufacture of the temporary revenue stamps
and recommend the number to be sent out; also be good enough to state whether it will
be possible to supply promptly a die and the necessary press for embossing stamps on
cheques.''

On 19th July, Messrs. De La Rue & Co. wrote:—

"We have no data upon which to form an opinion as to the probable consumption of
these temporary revenue stamps which are to embrace not only the Revenue but also the
embossed stamps, including 'that for the cheque until a press and cheque die can reach
the colony. Perhaps you may consider it desirable to forward 10 reams (60 sets) of the
2c. duty and 4 reams (60 sets) of each of the other 14 duties of temporary stamps, and
the authorities might be requested to telegraph if any further supplies are required before the permanent stamps can reach the colony.

We could supply one press and the cheque die (design submitted in our letter of to-day)
in about 10 weeks from date of order."

The Crown Agents confirmed the suggested quantities, and the consignment was duly
sent to the Colony, arriving there at the end of September.

In addition to the Ordinance No. 6 of 1888, referred to at the commencement of this
article, a subsequent Ordinance No. 10 of 1888 was published in the Official Gazette of
22nd September. Section 7 legalised the use of postage stamps for revenue purposes and
thus anticipated the use of the current postage stamps for the new stamp duties leviable
on the 1st October. This was necessary as the specially requisitioned supply was not ready
for issue to the public until the 5th October (Appendix 45).

On the 29th September the Government notified the Colonial Receiver General, the
Comptroller of Customs and the Chief Commissary of their appointment as Commissioners
of Stamps, the last named to have the custody and distribution of stamps.

An error in the wording of Sec. 38, Ord. 6 of 1888, relating to Bills of Exchange payable
at sight, and after sight, was detected by the Government, who, fearing to lose a considerable revenue thereby, issued a notice in the Official Gazette of 12th September. 1888, No. 354, dated 1st September, 1888, in which the stamp duties on bills of exchange at sight, and after sight, are differentiated.

There was considerable correspondence and discussion in the local papers at the time.
The Argosy of 15th September, 1888, referring to the incident, remarks: "The difference
between the law and the notice is very material. The Combined Court certainly framed
an enactment in careless language and the colony is threatened with a loss of revenue in
consequence, but until a new Tax Ordinance is passed we do not see why the Government
should attempt to secure the escaping revenue by any illegal process."

The Official Gazette of 31st October, 1888, contains the following Notice dated
30th October, 1881:—

"Referring to Government Notice No. 354, of 1st September last, notice is hereby
given that Bills of Exchange payable after as well as at sight require to bear a stamp of
the value of 2 cents only.

By Command,

FRANCIS VILLIERS,

Actg. Government Secretary.''

These temporary stamps,introduced,as has been pointed out above,to satisfy the demand
produced by the new stamp duties Ordinance passed by the Legislature at short notice,
caused more controversy than any other issue made in the Colony.

Although overprinted "Inland Revenue", these stamps were issued for postal purposes
also, to supplement the stock of the 1876 type and until a new unified series was manufactured
by Messrs. De La Rue & Co. All the values were not issued by the Stamp Commissioners
at once, but only such values as were requisitioned for from time to time.

The stamps first brought into use were the lc., 2c., 8c., 72c. and first four of the dollar values. For postal purposes the 72c. in October, the 1c. and 8c. in August, 1889.* The 2c. (without red 2) from 20th to 22nd May, 1889-t

On the 23rd May, 1889, the Postmaster General wrote the Government representing
that the 2 cents stamp was easily convertible into a 72 cents stamp by the addition of a
figure 7 before the 2, and suggested the overprinting of the entire stock with an additional figure "2."

Further sales were suspended at once. The stock sent to the Royal Gazette Office and
overprinted with the numeral "2" in red. These were put on sale on the 5th June, after
34,500 without the red overprint had already been sold to the public.

Copies of this red overprint have been seen inverted and double. 'They were made
privately by an employee of the printing office who passed a sheet of the 2 cent stamps
through the printing press. None of these double or inverted red overprints were ever in
the hands of the Commissioners, nor were any issued through the Post Office.

\end{marginfigure}

As early as 21st November, 1888, the Postmaster General complained that these "Inland
Revenue'' stamps were not suitable for postal purposes and were a risk to the post office
revenue owing to the similarity of all values, and that the 3c., 10c., 20c. and 40c. were
not in any way required. The Government, while recognising the difficulties complained of,
in view of the loss to the Colony which would occur if these stamps were discarded, urged
that increased vigilance be exercised in their use. Again on the 20th August, 1889, the
Postmaster General notified the Government of the serious inconvenience which arises
from the use of these temporary stamps. The letters reach the hands of the Examiner after
the stamps have been obliterated, and it will be readily understood that where stamps of
the same colour are of different values, denoted simply by small black figures, even with
the closest observation the Examiner may fail to detect the precise denominations of
stamps affixed to the letters, and especially in the imperfect light in which the duty has
often times to be performed. He accordingly suggested that the issue of temporary stamps
should cease at once and the permanent stamps which are in the Colony J brought into use.
This is minuted:—

"The Stamp Commissioners recommend that all the present provisional stamps except
the 1c., 2c. and $5 should be withdrawn and a notice to that effect published."
They were then asked to draft a notice giving effect to the suggestion. This was submitted, but they were informed on the 24th September, "Notice not in accordance with
instructions.'' Here the matter ended.

In the interim the permanent unified series of 1889 had been issued on or about the
6th September. At this time some firms of licensed stamp vendors, no doubt acting for
speculators, thought these provisionals would be destroyed and that this would be an
opportune time to apply for those of a value that had not hitherto been issued (e.g. 3c.,
10c., 20c., 40c.). The Commissioners decided not to issue these stamps. The stamp vendors,
not satisfied with this decision, urged the Postmaster to refer the matter to the Law Officer
of the Crown, who ruled: "That it is in the discretion of the Commissioners to decide
what stamps they will issue to the public; but when they publish a notice intimating that
stamps of a certain value will be issued to the public, they are clearly bound, in good faith
if not in law, to issue those stamps on application duly made at any time while that notice
remains uncancelled.'' The Commissioners, still convinced that the issue of the abovenamed
denominations was quite unnecessary, did not immediately act on this ruling, but
held the matter over.

Again, on the llth October, the Postmaster wrote the Government: "Enquiry has
been made of me as to whether the adhesive stamps marked 'Revenue' are available for
postage, and I would suggest that Public Notice should be given that Revenue stamps
may not be used for franking letters for the post.'' He was referred to the following letter
from the Government Secretary to the Stamp Commissioners dated 7th October, 1890:—
"Referring to your Minute of 27th November, the Lt. Governor is advised that the
Revenue stamps referred to therein as being withdrawn from circulation on or about the
6th September last, although overprinted 'Inland Revenue,' were issued by the Stamp
Commissioners avowedly for postal purposes, the stamps consequently ceased to be
revenue stamps only, and as you were informed in the communication from this Department
on the 23rd September last, they cannot be withdrawn without notice. I am to add
that as the stamps have never been withdrawn from circulation they are available for
postal purposes now.''

On the 17th January, 1890, the Government wrote the Postmaster—again referring to
the large stock of these stamps in the Stamp Commissioners' vaults, over 1,000,000 of
all values, as follows: '' Referring to your letter of 20th August last, on the subject of
the issue of provisional stamps, as no steps have been taken to withdraw these stamps
they may continue to be issued until the stock is exhausted."

The Postmaster General replied on the 24th February, 1890, that what he sought to
draw attention to was the inconvenience arising through the use of Ic. and 8c. being of
the same colour. "Since then the Ic. stamps have all gone out of use. The issue of the
8c. would be an advantage. As regards the 3c., 10c., 20c., and 40c. they were never required
for postal uses. I do not anticipate that these stamps would be much used for postage if
issued. Of the remaining overprinted stamps the 4c. is the only one that would be much
used for postage, and if brought into use at the same time as the 8c. they might be disguished
by a figure in red as was done in the case of the 2c. stamp. I do not anticipate a
loss of revenue if these overprinted stamps are used, for from the large number of stamps
purchased simply for collections I am satisfied they would be bought up chiefly.by dealers,
and in this way there would be actual gain to the revenue.''

The Government thought that in view of the Postmaster General's remarks the Commissioners
would no longer object to the issue of these temporary stamps, and on the
2nd April, 1890, the Commissioners intimated that in view of the changed opinion of the
Postmaster General they were prepared to issue the temporary stamps. These stamps were
issued from time to time as requisitioned for by the Post Office. Efforts were certainly
made to use up these temporary stamps, but the supply was far in excess of the requirements.

The similarity of all the values, the unnecessary number of denominations added to their
unpopularity for local postage, and during the course of years the gum lost its adhesive
property.

During a shortage of the 1c. value in July, 1890, recourse was made to  the $1, $2, $3
and $4 values, when the bulk of the stock were overprinted "One Cent

After the receipt of Lord Ripon's circular of the 18th August, 1893, the Postmaster
General called the attention of the Government to the large number of surcharged stamps
of the temporary and former issue that were still in use in the Colony, and recommended
that all the issues since the Post Office Notice of 1885 (Appendix 43) except the current
series of combined Postage and Revenue stamps, be withdrawn from circulation; also that
a new stamp of the value 10 cents be provided to represent double postage; further, that
all except the 10 cents and $5 values be destroyed.

stamps still on hand, and it was arranged between the Stamp Commissioners and the
Postmaster General to make another effort to use up these stamps, but little resulted
therefrom and they were finally withdrawn on the 1st July, 1901. In the meantime the
Government decided to recall all the dollar denominations surcharged '' One Cent,'' and
on the 19th April, 1894, the Post Office issued a Notice that these stamps would be demonetised
on and from the 1st June, 1894.

With regard to the 1888 issue the Government apprised the Postmaster General, on
the 23rd April, 1901, that they approved of these stamps being withdrawn from circulation
on 1st July, due public notice being given to that effect. And in the Official Gazette of the
1st May, 1901, was published the notice of the 25th April, stating that the 3c., 4c., 6c.,
8c., 10c., 20c., 40c. and 72c. would be withdrawn as from the 1st July, 1901.

The question as to whether it was the Government's intention to demonitise these
stamps was raised at this period, and on the 2nd May, 1901, the Postmaster General
addressed an enquiry to the Government on this point. The reply, No. 2434 of the 14th May,
1901, was: The issue of these stamps in the ordinary course would cease after the date of
their withdrawal, but anything that had already been purchased would be available for
postage or other legal purpose. Authority to destroy the withdrawn cent values was applied
for and given on the 28th October, and the destruction took place on the 7th November,
in the presence of three officers as per Certificate of the 8th November, 1901. The numbers
were:—

3c 46,273 40c 117,061
4c 39,910 72c 110,401
8c 71,519 5c. envelopes .. .. 2,784
lOc. .. .. .. 96,595 2c. on 5c. envelopes .. 364
20c 111,003

The next values recommended for destruction were the $2, $4 and the $9.60 Revenue
stamps. Post Office Notice of the 20th October, 1904, was published in the Official Gazette of the 22nd October, advising that they would be withdrawn from circulation on the
1st January, 1905. The destruction took place on the 26th January, as per certificate of
that date. The numbers were:—

§2 9,561

$4 67,467

$9.60 .. .. 5,471

The only stock of the 1888 issue remaining was the $5 value, and finally the Stamp
Commissioners applied for authority for their destruction, with a few of the $3 and $2.40
values. As new issues of these had been received in the Colony. Authority was granted,
and certificate of destruction dated the 3rd February, 1911, gives the numbers as:—

$5 108,840
$3 830
$2.40 720

\section{Reference List}

Fifteen values. Surface printed in double fugitive ink by Messrs. De La Rue & Co.
from the British Guiana key plate of the 1876 type, upon medium white wove paper watermarked Crown C.A. white gum. Machine perforated 14.

Design: Similar to the previous issue. The cent values, of which there are ten, were
printed in double fugitive purple, and the dollar values, of which there are five, were
printed in double fugitive green. The stamps were overprinted in black block letters with
the words "Inland" over Postage on the top label, and "Revenue" in the vacant bottom
label.

The value in numerals and the word cent, cents, dollar or dollars, as the case might be,
overprinted in black block type 3 mm. high in a straight line about 1 mm. above the purple
line of the lower label. The measurements of the overprints are :—

Revenue length .. .. .. 15-25 mm. x 1 • 5 mm.
Inland length .. .. .. 14-5 mm. x 1-5 mm.
Cents length .. .. .. 8 mm. X 3 mm.
Dollars length .. .. .. 11-5 mm. x 3 mm.


The red overprinted 2: The Postmaster General pointed out to the Government that
the similarity of colour values renders the 2c. liable to be fraudulently converted into a
72c. by the printing of a figure 7 before the 2, and suggested an additional overprint in
red as a safeguard. Sales were suspended and the stock of 72c. stamps were sent to the
Daily Chronicle printing establishment to be overprinted with the figure "2" in red.
The printers suggest that in making up the overprint plate ordinary printers' type was
set up in a row of six and then moulded, and electros made from the mould to form the
60-set plate.

The SI and $5 setenant and the $2 and $3 setenant have been chronicled by Lundy,
Moens and Morley. The only positive authority appears to be the first named in the
Philatelic Journal of Great Britain, who wrote: "I possess specimens of the $1 and $5
together, below each other with the perforations intact." The other pair is hearsay. If this setenant pair or others exist, they were evidently trial settings. All the values sent to the Colony were in panes of separate values.

The temporary overprint plates used in the manufacture of these provisional stamps
of 1888 were destroyed after the only supply had been sent out to the Colony in August
and September of that year. Vide Crown Agents' letter of the 20th February, 1890.
