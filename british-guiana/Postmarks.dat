\chapter{The Postmarks of British Guiana}

Alfred Charlton in a paper read before the Royal Philatelic Society of London in 1950, commented that: "as far as I can trace, British Guiana is the only country in the British Empire which used a datemark to cancel its stamps before it began to use obliterators."

This was probably due to the fact that this Colony is the only one, in which British
stamps were used, which had issued its own stamps before the use of the British stamps
was authorised.

The first datestamps were used to cancel postage stamps at Demera and Berbice. they were in use from 1850 until about 1860. They can also be found backstamping letters.


When British stamps were sent out in 1858 for use in the Colony, numbered obliterators
were issued to towns in our possessions on the Spanish Main, the numbers being A01 to
A15 and A18.

Of these numbers A03 and A04 were allotted to towns in British Guiana; A03 being used
at Demerara, the capital, and A04 at Berbice.

The names of these two towns have since been changed to Georgetown and New
Amsterdam respectively.

In most of our Colonies when the British stamps were withdrawn in 1860 on the passing
of the control of the Post Office from Great Britain, it is usual to find the actual obliterators in use for many years afterwards.

Although British Guiana assumed control of the Post Office in 1860 and the use of
British stamps ceased, I can find no evidence that the obliterators remained in use.
There were, however, many copies of the British obliterators made, some almost exact,
others exceedingly crude, and these may be found up to about 1880.

I would make the point here that a stamp suspected of being a forgery should not be
condemned on account of the obliteration, until an exhaustive classification of these
obliterators has been completed.

We also find concurrently with the above a duplex obliterator of a type not found in
any other British possession. The datemark portion is inscribed "Georgetown—B. Guiana"
in two concentric circles, but the chief peculiarity of this obliterator is that the forme is enclosed in a circle, whilst the letter A and the numerals are in pseudo italic characters.

All the obliterators are known in red, but are not commonly found hi this colour.

It would appear that a considerable expansion of the postal services took place circa 1870-
1880, as the issues of this period are found with various cork cancellations, which may have
been applied at places other than the two towns already mentioned, and to which cancelling
stamps had not then been issued.

Circular datemarks for these places were eventually introduced, the earliest I have being
1884, and I show two representative sheets of the concentric circle type.

The place names themselves are not without interest, and reflect the influence of the
British, French and Dutch settlers.

Other types of postmarks were in use concurrently, and I show one which was also
used in Great Britain and Jamaica at the same time, and which seems to have been copied
by the neighbouring Dutch colony of Surinam.

I have not tune to show all the ordinary later datemarks, but Kwakwani is an example
of a Post Office being established to serve a bauxite mine; and as the only mail is that of the employees, the postmark is somewhat uncommon.

Many place names have been changed since the first datemarks were introduced, and I
append a complete list of district post offices in 1945.
British Guiana appears to have a special postmark for every service, and you will note
some for Registration and another for letters going abroad inscribed Foreign Section.
There are no Air Mail stamps as yet. The Colony has a regular Air Mail service, the routes
of which you will see on the map.
When the service was introduced the letters were backstamped with a neat datemark—
"AiR MAIL GPO. BRITISH GUIANA."
The stamps themselves are now cancelled with a similarly worded datemark.
The 12 cent of 1860 may be found surcharged with an accounting mark in the shape of a
large 5d. in RED. The rate for letters to Great Britain was 12 cents (equal to 6d.) per half
ounce, and this mark was to denote the proportion of postage repayable by the Colony to
Great Britain for oversea letters.
My next sheet shows an oval mark inscribed GB 40c(entimes). Article 32 of the Anglo-
French convention of 1856 provided that all ordinary unpaid correspondence, charged with
transit or sea rates, which should be exchanged in the mails between the two countries
" shall receive, in some conspicuous part of the address, the impression in black of a stamp
intended to show the rate at which the dispatching office shall have delivered those letters
to the other office." This accounting mark is frequently found on the stamps of St. Vincent.
In 1831 the three settlements of Demerara, Berbice and Essequibo were united to form
the Colony of British Guiana.
Centenary celebrations were held in 1931, and all mail posted during this period was
impressed with an oval handstamp reading "British Guiana Centenary Celebrations
13th-17th Oct. 1931."
I also show two covers with cachets enlarging on the same subject.
The use of, Cachets has been continued since that date to advertise the country; and I
show one referring to Government Rice, and another referring to the Kaiteur Falls.
We now come to what I consider to be the most interesting group of postmarks in this
Colony, namely those of the Travelling Post Offices.
British Guiana has only one coast line; on the north. The other sides are bounded by
undeveloped lands of other nations. The country is mainly dense forest, except for the
mountainous district of the west. The early settlers did not penetrate far into the interior,
and established their towns on the coast. Consequently, communication between the coast
towns was very soon organised, mainly by coastal schooners. These proving slow and
unreliable, the project of a railway was decided on at a very early date, and in 1846 the
Demerara Railway Company was incorporated.

The first section of line from Georgetown to Plaisance was opened in 1848, thus being
the oldest railway in South America. The extension of the East Coast line (then known as
the Berbice Ry.) to Blairmont was authorised in 1901. The line is standard gauge and is
60£ miles in length. The West Coast line from Georgetown to Parika is 3 ft. 6 in. gauge and
is 18 J miles long.

In 1922, the Demerara Railway Company's property was acquired by the British Guiana
Government, and the management amalgamated with that of the Colonial Steam Service
under the title of the Colonial Transport Department, which at a later date became the
Transport and Harbours Department, and assumed control of all transport in the Colony.
Some confusion has arisen in the past by the fact that the original line east of Demerara
which is known as the East Coast railway, used the following postmarks:—Demerara East
Coast Ry. for Georgetown to Mahaica. Berbice West Coast Ry. for Blairmont (or Rosignol)

to Mahaica. So that we get both East Coast and West Coast postmarks on the East Coast
Railway.

Other railways, which are all privately owned, are:—

\begin{decimal}

\item Essequibo Railway, industrial line, metre gauge, from Wismar to Rockstone, 18£ miles, built in 1896. Used as a logging route and connecting line to diamond fields; and carries the first part of the No. 6 T.P.O.—Wismar-Rockstone-Tumaturi Travelling Postal Agency.

\item Blairmont Railway—4 miles.

\item Port Mourant Railway—5 miles.

\item Mackenzie-Akyma, 2 ft. 6 in. gauge.

\end{decimal}

The last three are sugar plantation light railways.

Unless a railway is actually indicated in the wording of the postmark, all T.P.O.'s are
steamers or launches, which ply both along the coast, and up and down the rivers. The
Pomeroon steamer is an important service and has a "POSTED ON BOARD" cachet. One
of the boats, named the Pomeroon, had the doubtful honour some years ago of arresting
the Grimsby trawler, Girl Pat (Skipper Orsborne).

Not all the T.P.O.'s have their distinctive postmarks, so I have appended to these notes
a complete list of all T.P.O.'s running in 1945 in case anyone is interested. Their routes
and numbers are shown in RED on the maps. I feel this may be of some value in the near
future when it is likely that a distinguishing postmark will be issued to each. There have
been many changes in the lettering of the postmarks over the last fifty or more years, and
it is now difficult to allot some of the earlier ones to their particular route. I have made the effort and stand to be corrected.

Lastly, I show a postmark inscribed "T.L.B. CLERK," T.L.B. standing for Travelling
Letter Bag. It is the one mark on which I can obtain no information as to the area covered
by the service, and I should be grateful for any help in this direction.
