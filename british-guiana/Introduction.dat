## British Guiana Stamps and Postal History



It was during my schooldays that I was fascinated by the stamps with the sailing 
ships on them. Little did I think that this sowed the seeds which grew into a lifetime 
study of the stamps and Postal History of British Guiana. 

The scope is endless and although looked upon as an "expensive" country it need not 
be provided that one does not aspire to the great rarities.

A collection of the stamps could usefully commence with the 1853-1860 imperf. 
lithographed issues with their interesting retouches. 

The 1860-75 issues were the first to be perforated and are full of interest. The plating 
of these stamps has fascinated philatelists for many years. C. J. Phillips drew attention to 
this interesting field for study and first A. P. Castle, and then Dr. J. Morton Evans and 
latterly myself devoted ourselves to this matter. It has not been completed and there are 
still problems to solve. Stamps are found bisected up to 1861 but were forbidden after 
that date. However they were bisected and trisected up to about 1870, and were passed 
by the authorities. The 1862 provisional issue appeared in three values with 24 stamps to 
a sheet. Like all the previous provisionals they were initialled by a member of the Post 
Office staff as a safeguard against forgery. For the 4 cents blue an ink was used which 
turned white in a chemical action with the paper. Rouletted 6 they were difficult to 
separate and stamps with roulettes on all four sides are very scarce. When the 1876 De 
La Rue issue arrived some sheets of stamps remained in stock without initials or 
roulettes. Years later these appeared on the market and are considered collectable items. 
The design was crude and the stamps can be plated quite easily. 
De La Rue obtained the contract to supply stamps in their fugitive ink and on 1st July 
1876 their first effort appeared, on Crown CC paper. 
In the period 1878-81 there was a spate of provisional issues due to various causes. 
In one case the 1 cent and 2 cents stamps in stock has been affected by the humidity and 
became a solid mass. 
The 1882 provisional issue was perforated with the word "Specimen" as a safeguard 
against forgery and so became the only "Specimen Stamp" to be available for postage! 
The first printings were 3 x 4 and the sheets had to be separated into two halves as the 
perforating machine could not reach the two centre stamps. However the format was then 
altered to 2 x 6. 
In 1888 a unified Postage and Revenue series appeared and the only point of interest 
is the surcharge "2" in red on the 2 cents value. This was because it was found that the 2 
cents could be altered to 72 cents by printing the figure 7 in front of the 2. In the 4 cents 
and 4 dollar values one stamp in six has a larger 4. 
The 1897 Jubilee issue came into use in 1898 as one of the priming plates cracked 
and caused delay in the production of the stamps. This issue was unpopular owing to its 
larger size and the 5 cents, 10 cents and 15 cents values remained in stock. They were 
surcharged 2 cents as there was a considerable usage for this value. Inverted and double 
surcharges are scarce and desirable items. Around 1913 a notice was sent to all colonies 
stating that it was desirable that the effigy of the monarch should appear on all stamps. 
British Guiana compromised by adopting a design which included both the ship emblem 
and the head of King George V. 
From 1931 many pictorial designs appeared and they make a very attractive showing. 
The Pre-adhesive period is interesting with the various types of hand-stamps which 
were used and they are not expensive. 
British Guiana is the only colony to have its own stamps before the stamps of Great 
Britain were used around 1858. The cancellation A03 was used at Georgetown and A04 
at New Amsterdam. The latter is well worth acquiring in good condition. Official 
stamps were only in use for three years from 1875 and are quite scarce although one 
should beware of forged overprints

In the De La Rue issues a good showing can be made of stamps with the various 
plate numbers. 
Colour trials exist of Gibbons type 30 and look most attractive. They are found in 1 
cent and 4 cents denominations. 

Cancellations are a subject in themselves and the scope is endless from the early 
"code marks" to the various village marks some of which in the author's collection are 
believed to be unique. 

Travelling Post Office marks abound as the main means of communication is by 
river. There are over 20 different routes each with its distinctive nomenclature. 
Altogether British Guiana is a most satisfying country to collect and full of interest.

When British stamps were sent out in 1858 for use in the Colony, numbered obliterators
were issued to towns on the Spanish Main, the numbers being A01 to
A15 and A18.

Of these numbers A03 and A04 were allotted to towns in British Guiana; A03 being used
at Demerara, the capital, and A04 at Berbice.

The names of these two towns have since been changed to Georgetown and New
Amsterdam respectively.

In most of the British Colonies when the British stamps were withdrawn in 1860 on the passing of the control of the Post Office from Great Britain, it is usual to find the actual obliterators in use for many years afterwards.

Although British Guiana assumed control of the Post Office in 1860 and the use of
British stamps ceased, I can find no evidence that the obliterators remained in use.
There were, however, many copies of the British obliterators made, some almost exact,
others exceedingly crude, and these may be found up to about 1880.

I would make the point here that a stamp suspected of being a forgery should not be
condemned on account of the obliteration, until an exhaustive classification of these
obliterators has been completed.
