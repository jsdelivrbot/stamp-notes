ON the 1st January, 1899, Imperial Penny Postage came into operation. There was an
increased demand for 2c. stamps, and a diminished use for 5c. and multiples thereof.
The higher values of the Jubilee stamps issued six months previously had not been largely
purchased. There was little demand for the two new values 10c. and 15c. introduced into
this issue and the Commissioners, faced with a large stock of these stamps, which had been
costly to produce, pointed out to the Government that there was in stock 96,600 at l0c.
and 124,680 at 15c., and on the 8th February, asked for instructions as to overprinting
them with a 2c. value. The Governor approved and the stamps were overprinted at the
\textit{Daily Chronicle} printing office and issued on the 22nd February.



There was a big demand for these provisional stamps and the Commissioners suggested
that they should not be sold at one time, but that supplies should be obtained at intervals of three days.

Later the Postmaster General intimated to the Government (on 28th February) that
he had in stock at the Post Office: 39,656 of l0c. and 12,345 of 15c. stamps, which were
issued to him previous to the overprinting and suggested that of these numbers there should be overprinted "Two Cents"—30,000 of l0c. and 10,000 of 15c., the remainder, 9,656
of l0c. and 2,345 of 15c., he thought would be sold at their original value as there was
still a demand for them.

The Governor sanctioned this proposal on the 4th March, but only 30,000 of 10c. and
6,000 of 15c. were overprinted. Further, the Postmaster-General, seeing that the 5c. stamps
were being very slowly absorbed by the public demand, recommended that this value
also, of which there was a stock of 207,900, should be dealt with in a similar manner. The
recommendation was sanctioned, and the remaining stock was overprinted and issued
on the 15th June.

A number of errors occurred in the printing, by carelessness or design. One of the first
discovered at the Post Office was the GENTS error in the sheet of 1Oc., which caused a
great amount of trouble to the Post Office. Quantities of sheets were purchased at the
Post Office, the error removed from each sheet, and the balance deposited in the Post
Office Savings Bank as a cash deposit. At that time it was permitted by the regulations
to make deposits by means of postage stamps. The Stamp Commissioner wrote on the
24th February: "Can anything be done to remedy this? Shall we take out the one stamp
and destroy it, or can we refuse to take overprinted Jubilee stamps on deposit?

The Government could not at that time take steps to cancel the system of making deposits
by means of postage stamps, but the cancelment took place on the 24th April, 1901.
A sheet of the 10c. with inverted overprint, and a sheet of the 15c. doubly overprinted
were discovered. These errors were brought into great publicity through the publication in
the Philatelic Press of letters to firms of Stamp Merchants, which purported to come
from a Postal Official, offering these errors at high prices.

The matter was taken up by the
Secretary of State and the Government made a searching enquiry into the matter. It was
disclosed that the writer was a lad temporarily employed at the Post Office, who had
neither access to the Post Office nor Commissioners' stock, and could not have obtained
any through this source. It was further ascertained that they were purchased across the
counter in the ordinary way. The Government demanded their return but only succeeded
in recovering 23 copies of the double overprint and 4 normally overprinted stamps (presumably
se-tenant with the double overprint) and these were destroyed in the presence of
the Commissioners on the 28th August, 1899.

The remainder of the errors of this issue had
been acquired by local collectors before this occurrence. The number that had been issued
were:—

\caption{1899 'GENTS for CENTS' error/variety, mint (part gum), SG#223b. pound28}
\end{marginfigure}
12 sheets of 60—lOc. with Two Cents inverted

1 sheet of 60—15c.

1 „ „ 60—15c. 4 rows of 12 (—48) Two cents double.

1 row of 12 normal overprint se-tenant with above

The procedure adopted for the overprinting is given as follows:—

\begin{blockquote}
"The quantity of sheets to be surcharged were sent to the printers from the Commissioners'
office in charge of an Official of that department. On the overprint being applied
they were returned to that office and carefully examined by the Stamp Commissioners
before being forwarded to the Postmaster-General, and those that showed marked errors
were withheld. These amounted to 300 and were destroyed, on the 19th September, in
the presence of four officers of the department. Yet in the large quantity of stamps handled some misprints escaped notice."
\end{blockquote}

The settings of the overprints on these stamps were consistently settings of sixty subjects.

The error GENTS occurred on No. 53 of the sheet of the 2 on l0c., and the other recognised
variety which shows CENTS without the period comes on No. 53 on the sheet of all these
overprinted stamps. It is believed that these errors were corrected.
A number of less prominent varieties of the overprint can be found. The examination
of a sheet of the 2c. on 15c. shows the following.


Row 1—No. 2. First T short. No. 3—Second T dwarfed in many sheets.

„ 3—No. 2. Leg of W broken.

„ 4—No. 2. First dwarfed T, leg of W broken, E of different font.
No. 5. First T raised, E of different font.

„ 5—No. 1. Comma after second T.

No. 2. Dwarfed T first, W leg broken, Bar between O and C.

No. 4. Top of T broken second T.

No. 6. Last E lower leg slants.

„ 6—No. 2. First T dwarfed, E has bottom end cut.

„ 8—No. 2. First T dwarfed.

„ 9—No. 3. No stop.

In a subsequent printing we find many of these defects, etc., corrected, e.g. on Row 5,
No. 1, the comma after T has disappeared.
