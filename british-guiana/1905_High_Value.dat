\chapter{The $2.40 Postage and Revenue}

The introduction of this high value into the Postage and Revenue series of the Colony
was made under somewhat special circumstances, and only continued until the first and
only supply was exhausted. Since then the 96c. stamp has, as previously, sufficed for postal
purposes. There have been cases where a higher value than 96c. has been needed for postage
and insurance on parcels, and occasionally for very heavy letters, but these have been
met by using multiples, or by the Postmaster specially permitting revenue stamps to do the
duty of postage stamps. It will thus be seen that the need of such a high value as a $2.40
postage stamp did not really exist.

The causes that led up to the introduction of the $2.40 value are as follows:—
In June 1904 the Postmaster-General brought to the notice of the Government that
the adhesive revenue stamps of denominations $2.40, $4.80, $9.60 and $12 were, it would
appear, printed in error in 1888, for revenue purposes only, because it was the intention
of the Government to unify the Postage and Revenue stamps of the Colony, and he suggested
that steps should be taken to make these stamps available for postage as well as revenue,
as it would be convenient to the public and increase the sale of stamps of these values.
He pointed out that the stamps of high values were used in payment of postage and insurance
on parcels and letters and emphasised the point that the Government had intended to
abolish the use of separate stamps for revenue purposes.

Stating further that owing to these stamps being available for revenue only, double
stocks of high values had to be kept, and the small quantities sold showed that people
preferred to use the high value postage stamps even for the prepayment of fees. The stock
of revenue stamps then on hand was given as:—

$2.40 — 2,400\\
$4.80 — 6,483\\
$9.60 — 5,524\\
$12.00 — 3,000\\

There was a'diversity of opinion about these revenues. The public demand was not great,
during the preceding five years the numbers sold were:—

$2.40 — 6,153 $4.80 — 915

$9.60 — 733 $12.00 — 2,203

The Government suggested that the whole of the present stock should be destroyed,
as the stamps would become useless, and the adhesive matter would soon deteriorate to
such an extent as to render the stamps unsaleable.

Later on in the year the Acting Postmaster-General recommended that the stock of
these stamps should be overprinted "Postage and Revenue" in the Colony. The Commissioners
suggested that before this was done enquiry should be made as to what arrangements
the Crown Agents could make for a further supply—whether printings could be made
from the die then in use, and an overprint from a plate prepared for that purpose. Enquiry
was made from the Crown Agents who replied on the 14th August: "The cost of making
new overprint plates will be £12 each. If the words 'Postage and Revenue' are to be overprinted
on the stamps, one temporary overprint plate will be required at a cost of £3/3/0."
On the 13th October, 1904, the Government communicated the following decisions to
the Crown Agents:—

(1) It has been decided to withdraw on the 1st January next from circulation—Revenue
stamps of $2, $4 and $9.60.

(2) That the stock on hand after this date will be destroyed, and they were requested
to take the necessary steps to have the dies obliterated.

(3) That the words "Postage & Revenue" be overprinted on all future supplies of
stamps of the denominations $2.40, $4.80 and $12, and they were authorised to obtain an
overprint plate at a cost not exceeding £3/3/0.

The first requisition for stamps from this new overprint plate was on the 17th July,
1905, when an order for 6,000 of the $2.40 denomination was included in the indent.
During the latter part of 1910, the Government were considering the advisability of
doing away with the $2.40 overprinted "Postage & Revenue," and on the 27th October,
1910, the Crown Agents were requested to destroy the plate used for overprinting stamps
"Postage & Revenue."
