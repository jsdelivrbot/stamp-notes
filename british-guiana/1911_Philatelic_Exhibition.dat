In 1911 a Philatelic Exhibition was arranged by the Philatelic Society. A special datestamp was designed and employed to stamp covers. The British Guiana Philatelic Exhibition was lauded in the Philatelic Press. The Hon. Secretary of the Society at the time was Mr. A. D. Ferguson who was credited for its success. He was also one of the exhibitors and was awarded the Gilt Metal for his fine specialized collection of British Guiana, which included the 8 c. and 12 c. of 185 and other rarities. Exhibits were also sent by the Earl of Crawford, M. P. Castle and other famous philatelists.(LP 0241).

A special commemorative handstamp was prepared for the occassion and used to address letters from the exhibition. One can find such covers addressed to philatelists and philatelic firms.
