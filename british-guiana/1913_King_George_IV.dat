\chapter{The King George Issue of 1913}


THE Secretary of State's (L. Harcourt) circular of the 20th April, 1911, to the Colonies
and Protectorates is given below, as it commences the history of the introduction of King
George's head on the postage stamps of British Guiana, a Colony which had heretofore
been very conservative in adhering strictly to the ship design and motto for its postage
stamps.

\begin{letter}
Downing Street, 20th April, 1911

With reference to the question of the design to be adopted in the new issue of stamps
for the Crown Colonies and Protectorates, I have the honour to call your attention to the
importance of providing that each stamp shall bear the head of His Majesty the King.

2. I am aware that special artistic designs have not infrequently been used in different
colonies for certain denominations of stamps, and I should not wish to interfere with any
very strong local sentiment on this subject, but I may observe that in some cases these
designs have been successfully combined with the intention that each stamp should bear
the head of His Majesty.

3. Further it is, in my opinion, preferable that for stamps bearing the King's head, the
portrait which has been approved for use in the United Kingdom should be adopted in
other parts of the Empire without alteration. I trust this will be borne in mind when it
becomes necessary to order fresh issues. L. HARCOURT
\end{letter}


On the 20th October, 1911, there was the further circular:—

With reference to my circular of the 20th April last, I have the honour to transmit you
the enclosed copy of an engraved design of the King's head, which has been specially
selected by His Majesty as suitable for use on Colonial stamps.

It would be in accordance with His Majesty's wishes that this design should be used on
all Colonial issues.

The Government wrote the Crown Agents on the 16th December, 1911, asking them to
obtain and send one or two etched designs for use on future issues of the postage stamps
of this Colony, containing the King's head in addition to the ship, and the Colony's motto.

"Hoping this may be possible without appreciably enlarging the size of the present stamp."

Their letter of the 13th February, in reply contained four designs were prepared by Messrs. DeLaRue&Co.

\end{figure*}

The designs A and B are dated 23/1/12 and C and D dated 7/2/12. The two latter were
designed in order to introduce more of the second colour into the stamp than is done
in A and B. It was at the same time pointed out that it was not necessary for the words
"Postage & Revenue" in designs B and D to be printed by the same plate as the duty and
name of the Colony.

\end{figure}

To do so seemed to give undue prominence to the words. The only
advantage of so doing would be that the same key plate would serve also for purely revenue
purposes, if an overprint plate were purchased for each revenue denomination.

On the 26th April, 1912, the Crown Agents were further informed that it had been
decided by the Executive that the King's head should appear on the postage stamps of
the Colony, but in combination with the arms and motto of the Colony.

\end{figure}


On the 30th April, 1912, the Government in acknowledging the designs sent, stated that
"D" had been selected but that the words "Postage & Revenue" should not be printed
in the same colour as British Guiana.

The four designs submitted were:—

A. British Guiana in white. Value in colour Dated 23/1/12. Unaccepted.\\

B. „ „ „ Value & Postage & Revenue in colour

C. - British Guiana in Colour Value in colour. „ 7 /1/12 „

D. „ „ „ Value & Postage & „ „ Accepted.

Revenue in colour.

From uncoloured illustrations little distinction is noticeable between A and C, and
B and D; however, the chief differences are that whereas in A the top label "British Guiana" is in white on the coloured background of the stamp with the tablet of value of another
colour in "C" both the label at top "British Guiana" and the tablet of value are of a
different colour to that of the stamp.

The difference between B and D is of a similar nature, with this additional dissimilarity
in B. The words "Postage and Revenue" are of the colour of the label, while in D, the
accepted design, they are in the same colour as the stamp.

The designs were unperforated engraved proofs on art paper with the label "British
Guiana" and value inserted by hand.

Further, the Crown Agents wrote on the 4th June, "The key die and key plate have
been put in hand, but we should be glad to know whether overprint plates will be required
for all the following duties, i.e., lc., 2c., 4c., 5c., 6c., 12c., 24c., 48c., 60c., 72c. and 96c.

In view of the smallness of difference which now exists between the price for stamps printed at two operations, we think it would not be worth while for a single operation printing plate to be purchased and we will therefore order a duty plate fqr this value (?) as for the others.

The British Guiana Government's reply was that overprint plates would be required for
all the above-named duties.

They were issued as the old stock became exhausted.
A No. 1 key plate—120 set, was struck and on the 2nd May, 1917 a No. 2 key plate
—120 set was added.

After this date the 2c stamps were printed in sheets of 240 and the printing plate was
prepared by taking the first plate and bolting it up with the newly made second plate.
The resulting 240 set printing key plate therefore shows the plate number 1 on the top
margins, a blank gutter between the two plates, and plate number 2 on the bottom margins.
The 2 cents duty plate was increased to 240 set. Since May 1917, all values other than the
2c. have been printed from Plate 1 or Plate 2. Those printed from No. 1 have the plate
number at the top ends of the sheet only, the bottom being a blank gutter, while those
printed from No. 2 have the plate number at the bottom ends, and a blank gutter at the top.

In order to facilitate the counting of the sheets and putting them in packets for shipment, a system of numbering of the sheets was started in July 1915. The number was stamped
on the top right margin of the last stamp, next to the plate number.

When the Crown Agents commenced supplying stamps to dealers direct, the sheets set
aside specially for that purpose were not numbered, and it has not been customary to
number them since.
