\section{Estimates of Printing Quantities}

One is up against a tantalising problem in trying to form an estimate of the
number of stamps printed, even with the information given above from the
Royal Gazette Account, the Blue Book and the 1854 Postmaster's Report.

It will be noticed that the mails were divided into three sections, the Railway
Mail, the Berbice Mail and the Essequebo Mail. The rate of postage with all
post stations on the railway line, which at that period extended to Belfield, was
4 cents. The Berbice Mail and the Essequebo Mail included post offices with
rates of postage 4 cents, 8 cents and 12 cents.

The total number of letters posted during the currency of the 1850 issue as
recorded in the Postmaster's Report of 26th January, 1854, are :

\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
               &1850. &1851. &Total.\\
\midrule               
Railway Mail    &266  &1229  &1495\\
Berbice Mail    &1571 &3930  &5501\\
Essequebo Mail  &758  &2176  &2934\\

Revenue         & $115.92 & $547.76 & $663.68\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{center}


The 1851 revenue included $82 for newspaper postage. Owing to the nonuniform
rates of postage the revenue derived does not give any clue to the
numbers of each value used, the average for each letter during 1850 being only
4.467 cents.


The total of 9930 letters does not infer that 9930 stamps were used, for it
must be remembered that the use of stamps was introduced to facilitate the
prepayment of postage ; stamps were not compulsory so far as local letters
were concerned, but prepayment was. It was quite a common occurrence for
postage to be paid in coin without having a stamp affixed to the letter, and
this is borne out by the number of letters found by Colonists without stamps,
although passed through the post. As late as 1860, out of a total revenue of
$5290.41, cash for unpaid letters totalled $585.23, while unpaid letters to be
collected on delivery amounted to $385.85 ; and as late as 1875 letters were
occasionally sent by district post offices unstamped, marked " Paid ", with coin
enclosed in the letter-bag to cover postage, despite the censuring by the
Postmaster which was occasioned by this practice.

It is very difficult to estimate even roughly the number of stamps of each
value printed. The 1495 letters by the Railway Mail were all at the 4 cent rate.
In the case of the other values, considerably more than the 1200 of 8 cents and
656 of 12 cents listed in the first account must have been printed. Taking into
consideration the importance of New Amsterdam, the chief town in the County
of Berbice, the number of letters at the 12 cents rate must have been a considerable
proportion of the 5501 recorded. In the case of the Essequebo Mail the three
rates were probably fairly equally divided. From the foregoing I am inclined
to estimate the printing as : 2628 @ 4 cents, 3000 @ 8 cents, 4592 @ 12 cents,
from which there must have been some small surplus on hand when the Waterlow
stamps were put on sale.

As regards the 2 cents value, there is nothing upon which to form an estimate,
but whatever the quantity, a very small number was used for postal purposes,
as the Georgetown Penny Post was not a success at this early period and passed
into oblivion. A number of these 2 cents appear to have been used late in the
year for country postage rates ; in fact, the only surviving ten specimens of these
great rarities are all recorded as being so used. The first four single copies were
said to have been taken off one letter,* and the balance is made up of the three
pairs discovered in 1889, 1896 and 1897.

* Philatelic Record, Vol. XI,

There are no official records in existence relating to the making of the cliches, the
number used, the size of sheets or the number of printings, but the enquiries made
by the late Judge Philbrick and Sir E. D. Bacon, K.C.V.O., from 1864 onwards,
through the Royal Gazette Office and the late Mr. E. C. Luard, as well as the
examinations recorded of numerous specimens from the large finds of these circular
stamps about 1877-8 which are described in the British Guiana section of the
Handbook of the British West Indies and British Guiana, have been of the greatest
value in helping me in coming to the conclusions which follow on the subject of
"dies" and "types".

Many years ago I discussed the printing of these stamps with Mr. Jardine
who acquired the Royal Gazette Office, and Mr. McNaught, who was for many years
in charge of that printing establishment and was conversant with the methods
adopted locally for work of this nature. From them much useful information
was obtained.

An old Colombian hand printing machine which is now used for pulling off
galley-proofs, was apparently employed for the printing in 1850, and a single
brass cylinder, used as a cliche, was recovered from a mixed lot of old dies and
woodcuts. From this material and from an examination of specimens and photographs
of all the stamps in the important collections, the following conclusions
have been arrived at.

\section{The Cliches}

The "die" or cliche used for printing these stamps was made with pieces of
brass printers' rule, bevelled at one edge and blunt at the other : 23 mm. wide
and 82 mm. long ; unevenly bent into a cylinder and roughly soldered at the
junction. These small brass tubes, 23 mm. high, varied from 24 to 26-5 mm. in
diameter, according to the degree of exactness in bending the rule to form the
cylinder, and the angle at which the measurement was taken; they were not
sufficiently rigid to withstand slight distortion of the circumference if wedged
too tightly in the forme for printing.


\section{Design}

Having prepared the desired number of these brass cylinders, ordinary
printers' type of Roman capitals was set up within and followed the curve of
the circle, reading BRITISH at the top and GUIANA at the bottom in sequence.
In a straight line across, forming the diameter, the word cents in small italics was
inserted, prefixed by the numeral of value : 2, 4, 8 or 12. The type was then
kept in place either by means of " leads " and " quads " or by chewed paper :
both methods having been employed up to fairly recent times in makeshift formes
such as these were.

\ph[35%]{../british-guiana/SG1.jpg}{SG 1}

The required number of these cliches was then imposed in a chase and printings
were made by means of the Colombian hand-press.

That the same cliches were used for printing all the values by the alteration
of the numerals is shown by the varieties of type which are common to all values.
I have come to the conclusion that there were four cliches used for all
denominations, and that these four cliches were imposed in a chase in a horizontal
row for printing.

This is supported by Sir E. D. Bacon's early investigations on the known types
and also recently by information from printers connected with the Royal Gazette
Office, and by the following observations.

In the first account from the Royal Gazette the numbers of stamps printed
are stated to have been 656 @ 12 c., 1200 @ 8 c. and 1752 @ 4 c. These numbers
are divisible by 2, 4 or 8, which points to cliches amounting in number to one of
these figures. From the evidence of known pairs and single types, it is clear
there were more than two cliches. With four cliches it was possible to get a
large number of combinations, which would account for all and more than the
varieties known. Take for example the types described belowâ€”a, b, c, d. These
are all found in the 4 c., 8 c., and 12 c. values, and a and b in the 2 c. value.

Assuming the four cliches were set up to print the 4 c. value, followed by the
8 c. and 12 c., this would have necessitated eight alterations of the cliches, involving
the possibility of twelve varieties, and if there was only one other printing in
1851, including the 2 c., another sixteen varieties were possible, or twenty-eight
in all.

The alterations may have necessitated slackening the wedging of the forme,
when the careless compositor no doubt allowed one or more letters to get shifted.
That the alterations were clumsily done is evident from the number of letters
which are askew. Again it is possible that in removing the chase from the
printing press at the end of the day's work, a letter or even all the type may
have dropped from a cylinder and had to be replaced. In different printings the
relative positions of the cliches were certainly altered, which is proved by the
pairs that are known.

It is evident that the sheets of paper used for printing these stamps were fed
three and four times on the printing press, after altering the position of the paper.
This would account for the irregular distances apart vertically, the relative angles,
and the slight superimposing of one circle on the next, due to want of care on
the printer's part. The distance apart of the cliches, one from another, would be
uniform on all the printings of any particular setting-up.

Mr. Luard has stated that the stamps were not printed so as to be easily cut
square as, although they were arranged in horizontal rows upon the sheet, they
were not placed in a direct line vertically, but the stamps in the second row
came beneath the spaces between those of the first row. This explains why vertical
pairs are so rare and accounts also for the stamps being so frequently cut round.
In describing the types, I have followed the lettering of the types in the
Tapling Collection at the British Museum. The sequence is arbitrary, but failing
any knowledge of the position of types on the sheet, it will be more helpful to
philatelists and prevent any ambiguity to adhere to this arrangement.

Sir Edward Bacon stated so far back as 1891 that he had been able to establish
eight varieties of type. It should, however, be pointed out that Judge Philbrick
in his article in the Philatelic Record of June, 1889, Vol. XI, page 123 (this was
originally a paper read before the Philatelic Society, London, on 31st May, 1889),
writes : 

\begin{letter}
"We (I speak of Mr. Pemberton and myself) found nine distinct types
in the 12 c., blue, several of them being reproduced exactly (save figure of value)
in the other denominations. To test identity of a type we took the two capital
letters ' i ' in 'BRITISH', and prolonged them in straight lines, seeing where these
prolongations intersected : and we found this method gave unfailingly a
correct result."
\end{letter}


and has a straight instead of a. curved foot. It has also been found only on the
pale blue paper.

Types a, b, c, d are thus found in each of the values 4 c., 8 c. and 12 c. Types
a and b in the 2 c. value and, I have no doubt, c and d, were used for printing
this value also, but only ten specimens being in existence, it is impossible to
verify this with so few copies. It may be noted that eight copies of these 2 c.
are type a and only two type b.

Type e is similar to c, and whichever was the last to be reset was evidently
reset from the other. Type g is similar to d and one is apparently reset from the
other. Type h was no doubt reset from c, and type / may have been the primary
cliche from which a was reset. It is also apparent that types a, b, c and d are
not the first and original setting of the cliches.

Although I have pointed out that there was a possibility of the printers
unintentionally causing twenty-eight varieties or more, we may safely assume
that so many do not exist.

There are certain characteristics of these stamps which are important in
differentiating the types :

\begin{enumerate}
\item Each circle has a more or less distinct break due to the imperfect junction
of the metal ; unfortunately this is not always visible.

\item The circular lines are either thick or thin according to the side of the
cylinder used in setting up the type.

\item Each cliche varied somewhat in the arrangement of the printers' type,
due to the composing of the design and alterations of value.
\end{enumerate}


I have found the thin line in type c and resettings of this type only, and I have
found it to be scarcer than the thick line variety in the proportion of about 1 to 5.

\section{Estimated Size of Sheet}

Judge F. A. Philbrick in his notes on the earlier issues of British Guiana*
writes :

\begin{letter}

"I am informed through one of my correspondents, that these sheets were
not larger than those on which the provisional issue of 1862 was printed, that
is, averaging 4 in. x $\ in., or 100 X 140 mm. 26 mm. is the average diameter
of each stamp. The interval between them horizontally in some instances
is as much as 14 mm., while others show no more than 5 mm. between
individuals. Four stamps would occupy 104 mm. if placed touching, leaving
about 36 mm. for marginal edges and intervals ; the average interval
14 +5 = 9.5 mm. would just allow four to the row, if the paper was 140 mm.
wide. Three stamps would occupy 78 mm. if touching, leaving vertically
22 mm. for edges and intervals, a rather closer fit than horizontally. As
Mr. Bacon told us, vertically they cut off close. I have noted one copy
with about 5 mm. margin, and it is cut square, showing no trace of its
neighbour; so that the interval of 22 mm. is about right for three rows."
\end{letter}

I have no further information to add to this communication of 1889, it fits
in with the facts and deductions recorded in the previous pages with this exception :
the number 12 divides into the totals 1200 and 1752, giving 100 and 146 sheets
respectively for the 8 c. and 4 c., but if divided into 656 for the 12 c. value there
would be '54 sheets and 8 over unless two of these sheets had 16 stamps each,
* Philatelic Record, Vol. XI, page 124, June, 1889 

which was quite possible; in fact I do not think the sheets were all uniformly cut
to an exact size judging from the margins on some specimens.

\section{Paper}

The paper on which these stamps were printed was of the quality used for
large placard advertisements or posters. Such paper was imported into the Colony
at that period from Alex. Pirie & Co. and Spicer Bros. Ltd. It was a wove paper
varying in texture. Four colours were chosen, yellow, green, blue and rose, and
several shades of these colours were utilised. One of the papers for printing a
later edition of the 12c. was an intensely indigo paper, locally known as sugar
paper from the circumstance that it was used in the shops for wrapping up parcels
of Demerara sugar. A pelure pale lemon paper was also requisitioned for the 4 c.
value; this is a very rare stamp, and not more than a few sheets of this paper
could have been used. The sheets of stamps were issued imperforated and
ungummed, they were severed by cutting, and affixed to letters by various
qualities of adhesives and sometimes by wafers.

[Judge Philbrick in his article in the Philatelic Record, Vol. XI, No. 126 (June,
1889), pages 125, 126, writes more fully on the subject of the paper used for
this issue.â€”-ED.]

\section{Paraph}

Before being issued to the public, the stamps were initialled at the General
Post Office, Georgetown. The object of this procedure is best explained by
quoting a paragraph from a letter written by Postmaster Dalton to the Governor,
in connection with the custody of the Colony's stamps. On the 2gth July, 1856,
he wrote:

\begin{letter}
"As a check on the printers, it is my invariable custom to initial every
stamp before it is issued for use, and no other would be passed by any of the
branch Post Offices throughout the Colony."
\end{letter}


It is evident that Mr. Dalton in using the word "my" referred to the General
Post Office staff, as the stamps are also known with the initials of the clerks and
letter carriers.

The initials found on the stamps of this issue are as follows :

\begin{enumerate}
\item E.T.E.D. for E. T. E. Daltonâ€”Acting Deputy Postmaster General, July,
1835. Confirmed, June, 1837, and Colonial Postmaster, 1850.

\item J.B.S. for J. B. Smithâ€”Clerk to Imperial Branch.

\item E.D.W. for E. D. Wrightâ€”Clerk to Colonial Post Office, appointed 1st
February, 1850.

\item H.A.K. for H. A. Killikellyâ€”Letter Carrier.

\item W.H.L. for W. H. Lorimer.
\end{enumerate}

The first four names are recorded in the Blue Book and British Guiana
Directory for 1851, but not the fifth. There is a tradition in the Colony that
W. Mortimer was the Railway and Post Office Clerk, but while some of the
initials on these stamps may represent badly formed W.M.s, others appear to be
a very distinct W.H.L. Mortimer's name does not appear in the Blue Book
either, and it is possible that the person who initialled was not at the time on
the fixed establishment. The authenticity of some stamps bearing such initials
is beyond doubt.

It is possible that the stamps, initialled by the letter carrier and railway postal
clerk were those found uninitialled in the course of delivery.

A few specimens in black pencil, perhaps hurriedly done when ink was not
available, point to such omission by the General Post Office.

The initials are known in black, red and violet ink, the first-named predominating
and a few in black pencil. Copies have also been found without any
initials.

In my efforts to get facts concerning the early stamps of the Colony on the
spot, complete reliance could not be placed on the memory of my local informants ;
for instance Mr. Dalton, writing so long ago as 1865 to Judge Philbrick, states that
the 4 c., 8 c. and 12 c. stamps were blue, green and red. In 1866 he makes the
same error in his letter to M. Rondot, and again no mention is made of the 2 c.
or the series of 1856 provisionals. Yet at the time all the records of the Post
Office were then available and none had been destroyed.

In more recent years, before I had discovered records, I asked persons who
had the handling and sale of the 1860 series of stamps to inform me how many
stamps were on a sheet, and although possessed of excellent memories, they were
not able to give the required particulars.

Judge Philbrick, writing in 1889, states that in 1865 probably not more than
a dozen of the 1850*3 existed in Europe. During the years 1877 and 1878 large
finds of these stamps were made in British Guiana. These came over in two lots,
and the Judge refers to having examined upwards of one hundred of this issue.
The first example of the 2 c. value appeared at this time.

\section{Reference List}

\subsection{First Issue. 1st July, 1850}

The issue of 1850-1 consists of four values printed in black at the Royal
Gazette Office, Georgetown, from rough brass cylinders with the words British
Guiana in roman capitals following the curve of the circle and the value in
numerals and cents in italics across the cylinder.

The paper was of the quality imported for poster advertisements, wove paper
varying in texture, four different colours being used, in order more easily to
differentiate the four values.

The stamps were imperforated and ungummed. They were initialled in black,
red or violet inks and sometimes with black pencil by General Post Office
Officials. Specimens are generally found cut round, occasionally cut square
or octagonal.

ISSUE IST JULY, 1850.

4 c., black on orange (shades) and lemon-yellow.
Variety : 4 c., black on pale lemon-yellow pelure paper.

8 c., black on green (shades).

12 c., black on blue, on indigo, on pale blue (shades).
Variety : with large figure " 2 " and straight foot. 12 c., pale blue.

ISSUE IST MARCH, 1851.

2 c., black on pale rose.

There are several varieties of type of all values

\section{The Cottonreels}


The London government established an inland postal system on July 1, 1850, but postage stamps had not yet been produced, so the postmaster in Georgetown went to the local newspaper Royal Gazette and had them print imperforate stamps in the form of an outline circle, with "BRITISH GUIANA" inside the rim, and a denomination, from 2c to 12c, in the middle. The printing was in black, on different colors of paper depending on denomination. These became known as the "Cottonreels", because of the type of printing press used, and are quite rare




The stamps were typeset and printed in black on variously coloured papers at the office of the "Royal Gazette" 
in Georgetown. The design was simple, consisting of a piece of printers' brass rule fashioned into a circle, 
within the circumference of which was the name of the colony in Roman capitals 
with the denomination in the centre of the circle. 

Three of the values - 4 cents, 8 cents and 12 cents were issued on 1st July 1850, 
and the 2 cents was added eight months later.

Before being sold to the public the stamps were usually validated by a postal official adding his initials. 
The names and initials of these officials were E.T.E.D(alton), H.A.K(illikelley), W.H.L(orimer), J.B.S(mith) and E.D.W(ight). The 2 cents was issued to prepay postage on a house-to-house delivery service in Georgetown, at the request of local merchants, which commenced on the 1st March 1852, before then all mail had to be collected at the Post Office. However this service was soon abandoned through lack of public support and thus lies the reason for the extreme rarity of 2 cents stamps. Only 10 examples exist with three pairs known solely on covers. 

Only 10 examples exist with three pairs known solely on covers. 

The typesetting resulted in various philatelic types. 

W.A. Townsend identified four, three with thick frames and one with a thin frame. 

Consideration of the 4 cents and 8 cents resulted in the 
observation that there were three thick frames to every one of thin. 
He omitted the 2 cents and 12 cents due to their rarity. However there are only two types, 
both thick frames, on the 2 cents value. 

Eight are type A, characterised by the first "i" of "british" leaning to the right, 
the other type (B) occur only on the Miss Rose cover. 

Type B is characterised by a raised and left leaning first "a" of "guiana" and 
a minute break in the outer circle slightly to the left of the first "i" of "british". 

Types as recorded by Robson Lowe 26th March 1970. 

A thin frame - break in the outer circle after "guiana" 4c., 8c., 12c. 
Varieties: i - the letters "ri" have been straighten 8c., 12c. Ii - "2" large, 
straight foot 12c. B thick frame - break over "gu" (reads "br itish") 2c., 4c., 8c., 
12c. Varieties I - break over "g" 8c. C thick frame - break over "i" in "brit" 2c., 4c., 8c., 
12c. Varieties: i - "1" in "12" omitted 12c. ii - second "i" in "british" dropped 4c., 8c., 
12c. iii - value higher - between "b" and "g" Only the 2 cents and 12 cents are known in pairs,

the first vertical where the measurement between the stamps varies from approximately 11/2mm. to 6mm., 
thus indicating that the stamps were printed in one horizontal row which was probably only a pair. 

The 12 cents were horizontally spaced approximately 14mm. apart. Vertical pairs are of the same type, 
horizontal pairs are of a different type. 

The earliest dated examples (August to November 1850) are all type A, so possibly type A was printed from singles. 
Type A is of equal rarity to C but type B is twice as numerous. 


Prospective buyers should be aware that the paper on these early primitive issues 
is not of the highest quality. Obvious defects are mentioned in the descriptions 
but irregularities in the paper of a minor nature should be expected.
