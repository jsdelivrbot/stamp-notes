\chapter{The First Issue of 1850}

\lettrine{P}{OSTAGE} stamps for the prepayment of letters were first introduced into the
postal service of British Guiana on 1st July, 1850.

Early in the year Mr. E. T. E. Dalton, the Postmaster of Demerara, drew
up the plan of a scheme for the establishment of an inland mail, at the request of His Excellency the Governor. The scheme was submitted in April and having
met with Governor Barkly's approval, the Combined Court voted $2400 for the
service, as an experiment ; and the new inland mail service was inaugurated on
ist July, 1850.

Nineteen country Receiving Offices were opened, viz. : Plaisance, Betterverwagting,
Buxton, Victoria, Mahaica, Hague, Boerasirie, Vergenoegen—the rate of
postage between these eight offices and Georgetown being fixed at 4 cents per halfounce—
De Kinderen, Mahaicony, Belladrum, Fort Wellington, Ferry, Leguan,
Wakenaam (seven more distant offices) with a rate of postage assessed at 8 cents
per half-ounce, Spring Garden, Lorg, Williamstown and Henrietta (the four
most distant offices), for which the postage was fixed at 12 cents per ounce.
With the Georgetown General Post Office in the County of Demerara and the
New Amsterdam Post Office in the County of Berbice, both of which were under
the control of the Imperial Post Office and were conducted independently of
each other by Deputy Postmasters appointed by the Imperial Postmaster General,
the Postal Department of British Guiana, Imperial and Colonial, comprised
twenty-one offices.

Thus, the great and important scheme of Colonial postal communication,
with prepayment of postage by means of stamps, was started in British Guiana.
The inland mail proved eminently successful as the subsequent history of
the Post Office shows. As early as 1854, when the inland mail service was in
its initial stage, a local committee appointed by the Government to enquire
into Post Office reform reported inter alia that they considered it but fair to
presume that if the service was extended under proper provisions, to be contained
in an Ordinance, the scheme might be made to afford increased facility of
communication to every part of the Colony and would be likely to prove
remunerative.

It will be seen that these Commissioners, at this early date of our postal history,
perceived what all the great postal reformers of the world have demonstrated,
that the Post Office is a great pioneer in opening up a country and in accelerating
transport therein.

With the commencement of the new inland mail, the prepayment of letters
was made necessary. To facilitate this, three postage stamps of the values 4 cents,
8 cents and 12 cents were ordered from a local printing office. These values were
the minimum rates of postage, on letters only, according to the distance of the
new offices from the General Post Office in Georgetown. Letters over the ounce
in weight must therefore have been prepaid by two or more stamps. Newspapers
were forwarded free of charge. The official notice embodying these provisions
was published in the Official Gazette of 15th June, 1850.


This Official Notice establishes the issue of three stamps for the use of the
postal service of the Colony on ist July, 1850, viz., 4 cents, 8 cents and 12 cents,
but does not indicate the colours.

On 22nd February, 1851, another notice appeared in the Official Gazette of
that date, stating that there would be a delivery of letters from the General
Post Office, twice each day, through the principal streets of Georgetown, commencing
on ist March. For this convenience it was made compulsory that letters
be prepaid by a 2 cents stamp, failing which they would not be delivered and be
subject to the usual charge of 8 cents when called for. The notice further
intimated that stamps of the value of 2 cents would be obtainable at any of the
receiving offices.

Up to comparatively recent times (1890) the authenticity of this 2 cent stamp,
first chronicled in 1877, was accepted as a genuine issue of this Colony with some
reserve. However, Mr. J. Rodway's discovery of the Official Notice which he
published in 1890 established its issue beyond doubt. Further corroboration, if
such were needed, is to be found in the concluding paragraph of Mr. E. T. E.
Dalton's report to the Government dated nth March, 1851, in which he refers
specifically to the 2 cents post in the following words : " This month the
Georgetown Penny Post commenced from which some small revenue may be
expected."*

The whole scheme of the inland mail service having been conceived and
arranged in just over two months, there was little time to design and print a
proper postage stamp. From the little evidence at hand these makeshift stamps
of 1850 seem to have been an afterthought of Mr. E. T. E. Dalton, and no doubt
the order for printing them was hurriedly given and a great deal left to the
printer's initiative.

Unfortunately there are few records in existence to give authoritative details
as to the method of printing and the number of each value printed. Such as
have been found are given below.

Firstly. The report of E. T. E. Dalton, Deputy Postmaster, dated 11th March,
1851, submitted to the Colonial Legislature. This consists of a statement of the
different expenses likely to be incurred by the establishment of the Inland Mail,
Salaries of Clerks, Messengers, Stationery, and matters of routine. Attached to
it is a. copy of an account from the Royal Gazette Office for printing and advertising
for the half-year ending 31st December, 1850 :





The proprietors of the Royal Gazette of High Street, Georgetown, were Joseph
Baum and William Dallas, printers to the Government.

This newspaper and printing office had several variations of title owing to changes of owners and to litigation. Previously known as the Essequebo and
Demerara Gazette, it was afterwards altered to the Royal Gazette, Demerara and
Essequebo, and on loth May, 1851, the Official Gazette of British Guiana was
substituted. These alterations in the name of the newspaper and printing
establishment carried on at the premises in High Street, Georgetown, account
for the variance in the early catalogues as regards the printers of the 1850 issue
of British Guiana.
A further account was rendered by the Royal Gazette Office for six months'
supply of stamps to June, 1851, which is recorded in the Financial Accountant's
Minute Book under date 5th November, 1851. Unfortunately, the account was
not filed. This would have established the total of each denomination of the
1850/1 stamps printed, as no further accounts are recorded.

Other documents that help in forming an estimate of the numbers printed are :
Secondly. The Blue Book of 1851, which gives the details of letters received
and despatched, viz.

The Tyne mail separately classified in 1853 referred to an additional postal
facility by the coastal steamer Tyne. Letters which it was desired to be sent by
that opportunity had the words " per Tyne " written on the envelope. Such
covers are very scarce.
The Blue Book total for 1851 shows 129 letters less than the number in
Mr. Dalton's statement for that year. This is probably due to the Blue Book
return being taken before the last mail for the year from outlying offices had
been received at the General Post Office. The difference in revenue, $55.56,
is considerable, and may be due to the omission of the newspaper tax referred
to in the subjoined extract from the Postmaster's report of 26th January,
1854, viz. :
" By a resolution of the Court the postage was reduced to one uniform
rate of 4 cents the half-ounce on letters to and from all parts of the Colony.
The same resolution also imposed a postage of i cent on every newspaper
forwarded by the Inland Mail. The resolution took effect from ist July
the same year. In 1851, 7335 letters passed through the Georgetown Post
Office, and the revenue amounted to $547 of which $82 were derived from
the tax on newspapers."

The resolution of the Combined Court above referred to was moved at the
Assembly on 2nd April, 1851, by Mr. O'Donaghue.

" That in any ordinance to be passed by the Court of Policy regulating
the rates of Postage by the Inland Mail this court recommends that the
rate on single letters be 4 c. and that i c. each be charged on all newspapers."
This was seconded by Mr. Haynes and carried.

The above extract seems to contradict the Post Office Notice in the Official
Gazette of 25th December, 1851, fixing 1st January, 1852, for the reduced rates of postage. However, further light is thrown on these discrepancies, by some
notes in the Financial Accountant's Minute Books on the subject :
" yth July, 1851. Financial Accountant recommends that the stamps
should be issued at his office and that the Postmaster should account to the
Receiver-General for the money."
This is minuted by the Governor on 8th July, 1851 :
" As regards the issue of stamps from the Financial Accountant's Office
it strikes me, on considering the length of time which must elapse before our
Post Office Ordinance can be framed, passed and confirmed, that it would
be better to commence at once to issue them there."
The Financial Accountant's Memorandum of 5th November, 1851, reads as
follows :
" The accounts now submitted are for the last quarter, the receipts for
postage are said to be §125.08 for the quarter. This has been under the old
plan as the Postmaster has not yet acted upon Your Excellency's minute of
8th July, being, I believe, uncertain whether the issue of stamps from the
Financial Accountant's Office as recommended to be commenced at once,
referred to the stamps at the present rate of postage* or to the stamps ordered
from England")" which are rated on a lower scale according to the resolution of
the Combined Court."

This is minuted by the Governor on 13th November, 1851 :

"As the passing of the Ordinance is uncertain, I think the arrangement
ought to commence directly, say 1st January."

From the foregoing it would appear that Postmaster Dalton put the resolution
as regards the tax on newspapers into force from ist July, 1851, producing the
sum of §82 for the six months as quoted in his report, and only published the
Official Notice after the Governor's minute of I3th Novembar, fixing ist January,
1852, for the issue of the new stamps from Waterlow & Sons which had evidently
been in the Colony for some time.

The newspaper tax must have been paid in cash as there was no stamp of the
value 1 cent before the issue of the Waterlow labels.

This tax on newspapers did not last long, for a notice was published on
3rd April, intimating that pending the passing of the Intercolonial Postage
Ordinance, local newspapers if posted within a week of publication would be forwarded free of postage.
