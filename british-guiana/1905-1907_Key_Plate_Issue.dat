\chapter{The Stamps on paper with Multiple Crown CA Watermark}


The date of issue of the multiple watermarked series of stamps was never published in the
Official Gazette, presumably because there was no change in design and it was only when
a stamp with a change of colour was issued that it was announced in the Gazette.

Reliance has to be placed on dated postmarks for this purpose.

From the shipments of stamps made to the Colony it appears that the first consignment
made on the multiple ordinary paper arrived there on the 10th June, 1904, and the first
consignment on the multiple chalky paper arrived there on the 17th October, 1905. The
blue paper for the 5c. value did not last long, the first issue took place on the 1st May,
1905, and it was replaced by a white paper on the 2nd February, 1907.

The alteration in the colour of the 96c. stamp which was authorised on the 18th July,
1890, only took place when a requisition for that value was sent in 1905, and the actual
issue was made on the 20th November, 1905.
