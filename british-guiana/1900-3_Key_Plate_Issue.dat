\chapter{1900-3 Issue}

It will be seen from a preceding chapter that the colours of certain stamps supplied to the Colony did not fully conform to the Postal Union requirements, for the equivalent of the 1/2d., 1d. and 21/2d. duties, and that some of the colours of the higher duties conflicted.

The Postmaster-General therefore welcomed a new scheme supplied by Messrs. De La
Rue & Co., who provided specimen stamps printed in doubly fugitive inks on different
coloured papers and with alternative colours, forwarded by the Crown Agents on the
30th March, 1900, who wrote as follows:—

1c. Imperforate Colour Trials
These colour trials were submitted by De La Rue to the Colonial Government in an attempt to comply with U.P.U. regulations of red for the 2c. value. Forty-six different colour combinations were submitted
Three trials in grey-green with value tablets in carmine, violet and in black, all on gummed watermarked paper and partially affixed to piece marked "Approved for 60c. (signed) W.H.M." and dated "21.3.03", fine. Photo 
Estimate £350 to £450}
\end{figure*}

\begin{letter}
"The 2c. stamps requisitioned for in December, have been put in hand and will be
ready for shipment in about 8 weeks' time.
"Enclosed are two sheets of specimen stamps printed in doubly fugitive inks on different
coloured papers. On the sheet marked 'A' the lc., 2c. and 5c., the equivalent of the |d.,
1d., and 2 1/2d. duties are shown in the colours which can be made most nearly to approximate
to those of the Postal Union requirements, viz.: Green, red and blue, and the remaining
duties are shown in colours which would give good contrasts. On sheet 'B' various
other alternative colours are given to select from, but I would point out that before deciding
on the colours to be adopted, it would be advisable if any night work takes place in the
Post Office of British Guiana, to examine the stamps by artificial light as in some cases the
appearance is considerably altered, especially in the case of stamps printed in purple
ink on yellow paper which become indistinguishable from the stamps printed in purple
on white paper. In some cases the distinction in overprints, which by daylight is very
marked, is considerably modified by artificial light, as for instance the blue and green and
red and orange. It would be advisable to make as few changes as possible; to adhere in the
case of any of the purple stamps which may be chosen, to overprint colours corresponding
to the existing duties of similar values.

\end{letter}

From the two colour schemes sent, the Postmaster-General recommended the following
changes, viz.:—

1c. On white paper in D.F. green with green overprint. P.U. colour.

2c. On red paper in D.F. purple with black overprint. P.U. colour.

5c. On blue paper in D.F. purple with blue overprint. P.U. colour.

6c. On white paper in D.F. black with blue overprint. The present stamp not being
sufficiently distinctive from the 12c.

48c. On white paper in D.F. black with purple-brown overprint. Present stamp not
being sufficiently distinctive from 96c.

1c. Imperforate Colour Trials
These colour trials were submitted by De La Rue to the Colonial Government in an attempt to comply with U.P.U. regulations of red for the 2c. value. Forty-six different colour combinations were submitted
Two trials in dull purple with value tablets chestnut and in green, both on gummed watermarked paper, fine. Estimate £250 to £300}

This recommendation was forwarded by the Government in their letter dated 5th May
1900, at the same time returning the two colour schemes. The remaining stamps they did
not think required alteration. In acknowledging this on the 12th June, the Crown Agents
wrote:—

\begin{letter}
We have had the stamps of the colours chosen mounted on a sheet, a copy of which we
enclose, and we find that the colours which have been in use for the 72c. and 96c. duties
appear to conflict by artificial light. We would, therefore, suggesj that one of these duties
should be changed and one of the doubly fugitive green stamps on yellow paper be adopted
instead.
\end{letter}

The Government agreed to a change in the colour of the 96c. duty, and in their reply
of the 18th July, the Crown Agents were asked to issue instructions for the substitution
of a doubly fugitive black on yellow paper with a red overprint for the 96c. duty when the
next requisition was executed. There was then a large stock on hand sufficient to last several years.

\section{The 60c. Issue}

In the latter part of 1902, the Government were considering the question of abolishing
the special Jurisdiction stamps used for stamping documents in the Magistrates Courts
and elsewhere, and the legalising of the combined Postage and Revenue stamps for all
such purposes as those for which the Jurisdiction stamps were used.

Early in 1903, the Commissioner of Stamps pointed out to the Government that: "if the
change of stamp system in the Magistrates Courts takes place within the next six months
a requisition for stamps which will be necessary to meet the demand should be ordered
promptly." He also recommended that as a large number of 60c. Judicial stamps were
used, a new stamp of that denomination in the Postage and Revenue series should be
printed. The Postmaster-General, who had been consulted, submitted that the new stamp
would usually be cancelled by pen and ink, and it was important, therefore that it should
be printed in one of the doubly fugitive colours—purple, black or green—preferably in
black on blue paper with a brown overprint.

A requisition for stamps was sent on the 25th February, and the Crown Agents in reply
on the 30th March stated that the stamps indented for would be ready in about three
months' time. With regard to the proposed colour of the 60c. stamp they pointed out that
it would conflict with the colours selected for the 5c. stamp, since the blue paper gives the predominant tone to the stamp in whatever colours it may be printed. A green stamp on
white paper with a red overprint for the duty was, therefore, chosen.
