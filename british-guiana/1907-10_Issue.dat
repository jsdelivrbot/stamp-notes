ON the 9th March, 1905, the Crown Agents wrote the Government: "Messrs. De La
Rue & Co. report that the British Guiana 120-set key plate which has yielded 170,000
impressions, i.e. used in the production of upwards of 20,000,000 stamps is now worn
out and unfit for the production of good work. A new plate would take two months to
make. If it is intended to continue the use of the same design, I have to request that we may
receive authority to put the plate in hand in anticipation of the next order.'' 

The Postmaster-
General to whom the letter was referred, remarked: 
"A sailing vessel is an
antiquated design for a progressive Colony, and I think it is a pity we have not the
King's head design." The Executive, however, decided to stick to the ship. The Governor
adding: "I am wholly in favour of the present design, and should be sorry to see it
changed."

On the 16th May the Crown Agents were informed that it was not proposed to alter the
design of the postage stamps at present in use in this Colony, and were requested to have
a new plate made in place of the one which was now worn out.
On the 17th July, the Crown Agents wrote saying that the new key plate had been
manufactured, and enclosed a certificate dated the 13th July, showing that the worn-out
key plate (No. 3) had been destroyed. The new key plate was No. 4—120 set struck on the
7th June, 1905.

\section{Economies in Printing Stamps}

The Crown Agents, on the 26th February, 1906, made the following suggestions to effect
economies in the manufacture of the stamps of the Colony:—

(1) To put in hand a 24Q--set plate for printing the 2c. stamps.

(2) To order a two years' supply of Ic. stamps, i.e. 1,440,000 and adopt a single colour
plate for this.

(3) To print the Ic., 2c. and 5c. stamps in singly fugitive inks which have been adopted
for stamps of equivalent values by the Imperial, Indian and the majority of Colonial
Governments, as it is thought that the danger of stamps of these low values being cleaned
after pen cancellation is not sufficient to justify the extra cost of the ink. The stamps could
then be printed in the Postal Union colours—green, red and blue.
With regard to these suggestions the Stamp Commissioners' views were:—

(1) The 240 set plate was not suitable for this Colony.

(2) Large supplies were not desirable as mucilage deteriorates.

(3) Singly fugitive inks to be used for stamps below 60c.; doubly fugitive for stamps above
that value.

A later proposition in the interests of economy was made two years later, on the
14th April, 1908, when the Crown Agents suggested that a saving of expense might be
effected by the purchase of a 240-set plate for printing the 2c. stamps at one operation.
The Government agreed to this in their communication of the 4th March, 1909, and
requested that Messrs. De La Rue & Co., be instructed to put the new plate in hand as
early as possible, to be ready for printing the next supply of stamps.

De La Rue & Co. made a new 240-set key and duty plate by June 1909, from a redrawn
die showing a slight variation of the flag; this plate was numbered 1 at top and bottom of
the four panes.

We return now to the end of April, 1906, when the Government communicated to the
Crown Agents a suggestion of the Stamp Commissioners that singly fugitive ink might
be used for the printing of all stamps below 60c. in value and doubly fugitive ink for printing
all the values above: To this the Crown Agents replied on the 18th June, 1906: "We do
not consider it advisable to discontinue the use of doubly fugitive ink for stamps of any
higher values, and if pen-marked cancellations were removed to any great extent from high
values it would involve a serious loss. We suggest the reconsideration of the Stamp Commissioners'
recommendation that doubly fugitive ink should be discontinued for all values
below 60c. In the event of the Government adhering to the Stamp Commissioners' recommendation,
we enclose a colour scheme showing the whole series of stamps up to and
including the 60c., which if adopted would, we think, form a good range of stamps. We
also enclose a further sheet of stamps from which it will be possible to make a selection
in case some of the suggested series are not considered suitable.'' It was from this colour
scheme that the Government decided on the new series of stamps from Ic. to 12c. printed
in singly fugitive ink and issued in 1907.

On the 13th September, 1906, the Crown Agents were advised that it had been decided
that stamps over 12c. duties should continue to be printed in doubly fugitive ink. The
colour scheme was returned with the approved colours for the values from Ic. to 12c.
designated, and a request that in the execution of future indents, these colours be adopted.
This was followed by a requisition a few days later. The shipment arrived in January,
1907, and the stamps were issued, the 5c. on the 2nd February, and other values on the
4th February.

\section{Stamp Booklets}

STAMP BOOKLETS
The suggestion of introducing stamp booklets in the Colony appears to have originated
in 1908 from Mr. J. W. H. Park, the Colonial Civil Engineer, who had then recently arrived
from Ceylon, and who referred to the success which attended the introduction of these in
Ceylon. The Postmaster-General afterwards supplied the Government with a memorandum
giving particulars about the booklets used in the United Kingdom, and advised the adoption
of similar booklets as were then used, viz.: 18 at Id. and 11 at |d., sold at 2/-. Oa the
10th October the Government addressed a letter to the Crown Agents asking for estimates
of cost for supplying booklets containing 18 at 2c. and 11 at Ic. stamps to be sold for
48c. The reply dated the 15th December, quoted a rate for supplying booklets containing
30 stamps interleaved with wax paper bound in tinted paper covers, printed on one side
only, and parcelled in 200's. At the same time it was pointed out, the booklets could only
be supplied in multiples of six stamps, as those issued in the United Kingdom involved
special plates for printing stamps with a cross in place of the first and seventh stamp.
A60-set plate costing£21/5/Owould besufficient for the purpose in the case of British Guiana.

The only other way in which booklets of 29 stamps could be supplied was by having one
stamp in each book cancelled with the words "not for use." This would involve an extra
charge of 3/- per 1,000 booklets in addition to the initial expense of £1 for an overprint
plate. This latter arrangement was adopted but discontinued by the Government of Natal,
as the arrangement was considered a very awkward one, and no other Colony had adopted
it. They observed that the better course would be to include the 30 stamps and make an
additional charge for each book. This reply was considered by the Government and they
agreed to the proposal of introducing stamp booklets with 30 stamps, and on the 6th March,
1909, an order was despatched for 25,000 booklets each containing 30 stamps (18 at 2c.
and 12 at Ic.) These duly arrived and were placed in the Stamp Commissioners' custody
on the 2nd June, 1909. The stamps were printed from the No. 1—120-set key plate.

Reference List: Six values printed from the 1889 key plate, No. 4, in singly fugitive ink
on multiple ordinary Crown CA paper.

1c. Blue-green.

2c. Rose-red.

(a) rose red with dark red tablet.

4c. Brown and purple Shades

5c. Ultramarine „
P & R in thick type

6c. Grey and black „

12c. Orange and mauve. „

Redrawn type.

2c. Rose-red.

In 1915 a consignment of the 4c. value arrived in the Colony, the stamps in which were
printed in sheets with double border lines. The ordinary border or Jubilee line, which
is broken at each point of perforation, is always in the colour of the key plate and is placed
as a guard against the flattening out of the edge by the roller. The second border line in
this case is in the colour of the duty plate, is continuous at top and bottom, but at the sides
is broken at every second stamp. Messrs. De La Rue suggest that it was evidently placed
by a printer new to his work and that it was unnecessary and unusual. No other values
have appeared thus

Flag at fore-top more distinct and flag at main-top is close to mast.
Words "Postage & Revenue" smaller than earlier type.
