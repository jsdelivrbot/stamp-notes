\chapter{1882 Jan 9, Typeset Issue}
SINCE 1878 the authorities had had trouble, being short of 1 and
2 cent stamps. The new Crown and C A stamps did not arrive
until June 1882.

So at the end of 1881 the postal authorities invited Messrs.
Baldwin & Co. (printers) of Georgetown to print 1 and 2 cent
stamps. This they did.

At the top of the columns of shipping notices were little pictures of either
two or three-masted ships. The printer took this for a centre and put four lines
around. At top and bottom outside these were put a row of ten little crosses,
divided and separated by lines, the crosses forming diamonds. These twelve
diamonds were divided into groups by a full stop quad. This makes plating easy.
The value and stop at bottom also varies in relation to the diamonds and
vertical lines.

Each sheet was printed in six rows of 2 or four rows of 3. In my opinion, the
4 X3 was first printed, for the few sheets of 4 X3 I have seen were divided into two
rows of 3 in order, I think, to make punching easier.

The 6x2 occurs commonly enough in complete sheets.

The few dated copies that I have seen that are decipherable vary from Jan. '82
to '84, and I have found more 4 X3 in '82, and 6 X2 in '84.



After being printed they were taken to the Receiver-General's office and
punched " Specimen." This punching machine had been previously used to
punch " Specimen " in the 1876 Crown and CC specimen stamps.
This, I think, Was to relieve the Postmaster-General from initialing each stamp,
as he had had to do for the first issue and the 1862 Provisional issues.
The sheets and margins were perf. 12.

2c. yellow, 1st setting, 3rd. printing, a block of six [7-9/10-12] with [7-9] and [12] showing small "2", fine unused. S.G. 163/163b/165/165c, £660 
Estimate £200 to £250}
\end{figure}

Rarely the stamps are found imperforate between, without specimen,
and also with " Specimen " punched two or three times, and very rarely with
"Specimen" punched in a cross from corner to corner.

Now taking the known Settings A and B :—

In the 4x3 6x2

No. 1 becomes No. 2
„ 2 ,, , , 5 but right border does not correspond.
„ 3 ,,6
„ 4 „ ,. 4
5 ..7 but has the " i " with a foot.
„ 6 „ ,, 8
„ 7 -.3
„ 8 „ „ 9
,, 9 is " i " with foot. ,, 10
,, 10 ,, ,, i Neither border corresponds.
,, ii ,, ,, ii
,, 12 ,, ,, 12

Taking the 6x2 and comparing it with the 4x3 the numbers are altered to
the above table, but Nos. 5, 6 and i in regard to their borders do not fit in. No. 7,
the " i " with foot, is found in No. 9.

All the value letters and stop are altered.

The punched " Specimen " which in Settings A and A2 runs from right upwards
in left and left downwards in right rows, in Setting B runs in first and third rows
from left upwards. And in second and fourth rows from right downwards.
In the new Setting of 6x2 that I am showing the following differences
occur:—

No. 6. The omitted ornament in right border has been filled in.

No. 7. The foot of the " I " of No. 7 has vanished. (So S.G.'s note
should be omitted.)

No. 8 has a short squat figure " i," this, no doubt, being the " i " with
the foot broken off.

No. 12 has the '• 2 " of " 1882 " well away from the right border, and
the stop which had been omitted is inserted.


Also in each stamp the value and stop in relation to the diamond and line is
altered as compared with Setting A, as shown in the examples.
But the central two- or three-masted ship remains the same.

The stamps can be found imperforate between.
