\chapter{1852 Surface Coloured Paper}

\newthought{The colonial inland mail} scheme of charging postage on letters by distance did
not meet with general approval. The charge of 12 cents was considered an
excessive one. It was pointed out that letters could be sent by passenger boats
for a nominal cost, and it was suggested that for this reason the Inland Post
was not more used.

Postmaster Dalton desired to make the Inland Mail a success and the Government
were willing to reduce the fees when an opportunity occurred. Consequenty,
when the Post Office estimate was under consideration at the Combined Court
on 2nd April, 1851, this matter was brought up. Mr. O'Donoghue moved a resolution,
seconded by Mr. Haynes—That in any ordinance to be passed by the
Court of Police regulating the rates of postage by the Inland Mail this Court
recommends that the rate of postage on all single letters be 4 cents and that 1 cent
each be charged on all newspapers. This was adopted. An amendment by
Mr. Gilbert, that the postage on letters be 2 cents and on all newspapers 1 cent,
was lost.

No doubt dissatisfied with the crude labels produced locally, and anticipating
an early change in the postal rates, Mr. E. T. E. Dalton, on 26th February, 1851,
wrote the Governor suggesting that a supply of stamps should be obtained
from England.

The reply from J. G. Austin, Acting Assistant Government Secretary, dated
nth April, 1851, is as follows:

\begin{letter}
" I have the honour to inform you that His Excellency the Governor
has been pleased to approve of your suggestion of sending to England for
the stamps necessary for the carrying out of the new postage arrangement."
A most unusual procedure was adopted in order to procure the stamps from
England, illustrating the lack of control exercised by the Government at this early
date over the postage stamp supplies. The authority to obtain these stamps
was left in the hands of the Postmaster as was the case with the first issue. An
order for 50,000 i cent and 4 cent stamps was placed by him with a local firm
of stationers, J. W. Richardson & Coleb'eck, who requisitioned Waterlow & Sons,
London, to prepare the dies and stamps.

It is not recorded, but presumably the suggestion of the design originated in
the colony. The adoption of the colony device, a ship in full sail and the motto,
" Damus'petimusque vicissim '.' * was a happy thought, and it has been retained
on the stamps of British Guiana with tenacity, in spite of many suggestions to
change it 

\section{Design}

A plain shield on which is depicted a three-mast vessel in full sail to the right ;
in the distance on the right a ship with furled sails ; on the left a fort, wavy lines
showing a rough sea ; above the shield the value in numeral and block letters ;
below the shield the words " DAMUS PATIMUS " in one line, under which is " QUE
VICISSIM " in smaller block letters ; " BRITISH " on left of shield and " GUIANA "
on right, also in block letters, the whole being enframed in a single-line upright
rectangle.

The Postmaster requisitioned for 50,000 i cent and 4 cent stamps. There is
no record of the number of each value ordered—probably an equal quantity
of each—-nor is there any record of the date of arrival in the colony. A memo
in the Financial Accountant's book dated 5th November, 1851, suggests that
the stamps were then lying in his office.

The date of issue was officially fixed for the 1st January, 1852.
This issue has been popularly called the Patimus issue. In preparing the
dies the word " petimus " was wrongly spelt as " patimus." Writing on the 5th
December, 1864, to Judge Philbrick, Postmaster Dalton attributed this error
to the engraver of the die in England.

Two varieties of type of each value are known. They were either engraved
side by side on a copper plate, or the two dies were clamped together for the
purpose of taking transfers for the make-up of the lithographic stone. These
two types are always found together in all pairs.

The varieties of type can be distinguished by differences in the drawing of the
small forts in the background and of the wavy lines representing the sea, but
the most reliable method of separating the types is by examining the left-hand
outline of the upper sail. In the one stamp this sail is only slightly hollowed
on the left-hand side (var. a), in the other the outline of the sail is bent inwards
and meets the top of the lower sail in quite a different place varying slightly in the
two values (var. b). In the i cent there is also a stop after the word " GUIANA "
in this type.


\section{Printing of the Stamps}

About 1890, Sir E. D. Bacon in some interviews with Mr, J. B. Rapkin, Chief
of the Engraving Department of Waterlow & Sons, Ltd., writes,^ " He assures
me that these stamps like all other British Guiana issues manufactured by his
firm were printed by lithography, and he believed that all the British Guiana dies
used by them were engraved on copper." So far as the subsequent issues are
concerned, this had been previously affirmed by Waterlow's. Mr. Rapkin then
described the system of printing :

" A number of impressions are taken from the engraved dies on to transfer
paper. These specimens are cut out and pasted on a sheet of paper, leaving
a regular space between each pair of stamps. After the requisite number of rows are completed, the whole sheet is transferred to a lithographic stone at
one operation."

He was unable to explain how it was that two impressions of the design were
engraved for each value, an unusual course to pursue, and until he had seen
the two varieties of design he could hardly believe such was the case.
It is assumed that the sheet contained one hundred stamps, as is known to
have been the case with the reprints made in 1864.

The few strips of 1 cent value in existence show that the transfers from the
double dies were not placed in exact alignment horizontally or vertically, the
distance varying from 5 to 6 mm. apart, whereas the two dies are always 2-5 mm.
apart. The space between two pairs of types in the Ferguson Collection are
5 mm. distant at the top and 5-5 mm. at the bottom.

There are a number of slight differences in the letters, etc., such as a dropped
"T" in "PATIMUS", "Q"s with straight, angular and short serifs, all pointing
to numerous transfer varieties.

\section{Reprints}

These two stamps, as is well known, were reprinted in 1865 on paper somewhat
thicker than the originals and perforated 12. The sheets of the reprints contain
one hundred stamps in ten rows of ten and in the centre of the bottom margin the
inscription," Waterlow and Sons, London," appears.

The make-up of these sheets is described in Stanley Gibbons' Monthly Journal
of March 1903 by a writer who had had the opportunity of examining complete
sheets. The opinion is expressed that "either the original dies (whatever they
consisted of) were retained and fresh stones constructed from them for making the
reprints or else the original stones were still in existence; and in the latter case
the sheets of reprints are even more interesting\ldots." The arrangement of the
sheet of the 1 cent is given as follows :

The top row consists of a b a b a b a b a b

All the other rows a b a b a a b a b a
Of the 4 c.

The f i r s t , second a n d fourth rows b a b a b b a b a b
The third, sixth, seventh, eighth,
ninth and tenth rows are
similar to the nine rows of the
ic. a b a b a a b a b a
And

The fifth row to the first row
o f t h e 1c. a b a b a b a b a b

The 1c. rose was reprinted in 1865 in sheets of 100 stamps 10 x 10, but as this
reprint was made on thin paper and the sheets were perforated 12 it is easily
distinguishable from the issued stamp.
