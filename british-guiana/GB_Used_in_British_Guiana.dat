\chapter{GB Used in British Guiana}

When British stamps were sent out in 1858 for use in the Colony, numbered obliterators
were issued to towns on the Spanish Main, the numbers being A01 to
A15 and A18.

Of these numbers A03 and A04 were allotted to towns in British Guiana; A03 being used
at Demerara, the capital, and A04 at Berbice.

The names of these two towns have since been changed to Georgetown and New
Amsterdam respectively.

In most of the British Colonies when the British stamps were withdrawn in 1860 on the passing of the control of the Post Office from Great Britain, it is usual to find the actual obliterators in use for many years afterwards.

Although British Guiana assumed control of the Post Office in 1860 and the use of
British stamps ceased, I can find no evidence that the obliterators remained in use.
There were, however, many copies of the British obliterators made, some almost exact,
others exceedingly crude, and these may be found up to about 1880.

I would make the point here that a stamp suspected of being a forgery should not be
condemned on account of the obliteration, until an exhaustive classification of these
obliterators has been completed.

Stanley Gibbons in their customary manner list these obliterators with a prefix "Z" and they are numbered from Z1-Z8, the numbering depending both on the stamp and obliterator they were used.

The most commonly found usage of the "A03" obliterator used at Demerara is on the 6d., which paid the postage for a single rate to Great Britain (Figure~\ref{covergb}).
