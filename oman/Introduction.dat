# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Oman (Muscat)

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Muscat and Oman, including the present day Sultanate of Oman.

Muscat and Oman used first the stamps of [India](../india/introduction), then Pakistan, then British Postal Agencies in Eastern Arabia, before finally issuing its own stamps as 
the Sultanate of Oman on 16 January 1971.

Oman had one Dependency [Guadur](../guadur/Introduction) or Gwadur which had a parallel fascinating history that spanned over 90 years (See [Gwadur](../guadur/Introduction).)

\section{The First Post Office}

It is recorded that the Muscat Post Office was opened in 1856; Donalson mentions that an official despatch from the India Office Library gives May 1st 1864 as the actual date. From then until December 19th 1947, with the sole exception of the 1944 Al bu Said bi-centenary issue, contemporary Indian stamps with any overprint were in use.

The Post Office belonged to the Bombay Circle, and the first stamps that were placed on sale were those of the Queen victoria East India issue. The most common usage was the \half  anna stamps although values up to 8 annas are occasionally seen. 

\section{1966 Oman Administration}

On the 30 April 1966, Oman's postal service was taken over by the Oman government and the first set of Omani postage stamps was issued. These stamps showed the port of Muscat, the great forts and the national crest. The stamps bore the inscription "Muscat and Oman" and they remained in use until 15 January 1971.

The name of the country was later changed to "Sultanate of Oman" when HM Sultan Qaboos made a proclamation on the 9 August 1970.

The period between 1970 to 1985 saw the expansion of post offices to other towns and villages. It is reported that between 1971 to 1984 the number of outgoing letters increased from 3,717 in 1971 to 16,147 in 1984. Nevertheless commercial covers from these period are hard to find due to the low volume of correspondence.
