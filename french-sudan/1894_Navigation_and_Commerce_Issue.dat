\ph[35%]{../french-sudan/517.jpg}{517		Yvert #1	Yvert #1, 1894 "SOUDAN Fais/0,15" Surcharge on 75c Carmine on rose, a premium quality mint example of this terribly difficult and rare stamp, possessing a marvelous overall freshness which is quite uncharacteristic of this, plus its centering is far better than usually found, strong color, o.g. with only a tiny trace of hinging, very fine; while 1,000 stamps were surcharged most were used for postage and the small number of mint examples that remain are most often faulty and/or quite off center, which makes this one of the finest mint singles available; signed A. Brun and Calves and accompanied by 2001 Calves certificate (Scott #1; $4,500.00). (Image)	 \euro4,700 

SOLD for $3,500.00 }

Bronze green on straw, a highly desirable example of this often faulty mint stamp, well centered, especially when compared to the others, as these typically come quite off center, unusually fresh with luxuriant color, o.g., l.h., very fine; while 950 stamps were surcharged most were used and lost to philately, leaving scant few mint examples available, of which the example offered here is among the finest; signed Champion (Scott #2; $4,750.00).  \euro5,300
