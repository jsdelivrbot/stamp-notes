This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire and the Belgian Congo. See also the stamps of the [French Congo](../french-congo/introduction).


\subsection{Belgian Congo}

The Belgian Congo started life as the Congo Free State becoming the Belgian Congo in 1907. 

In 1997 the country changed name to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Under Leopold II's administration, the Congo Free State became one of the greatest international scandals of the early twentieth century. The report of the British Consul Roger Casement led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for killings during a rubber-collecting expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese people).

In 1997 the country changed name to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The loss of life and atrocities inspired literature such as Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and raised outcries, even from such upholders of the colonial mission as Winston Churchill. One view is that the forced labour system directly and indirectly eliminated 20% of the population.


\subsection{Zaire}

The first stamps of Zaire were issued on 18 December 1971.[1]
