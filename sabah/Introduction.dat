This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Malaysia. All states of Malaysia issue stamps, mainly definitive stamps of the same design, but with their respective state names.

Malaysia started issuing stamps after independence from the United Kingdom on 31 August 1957. These stamps bore the title of Malayan Federation until 9 August 1963 when Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore merged with Malaya to form Malaysia. Singapore became independent from Malaysia in 1965. 


The Stamps and Postal History of Sabah, An Introduction
G.A. Chatfield   

Sabah is one of 13 member states of Malaysia, and is its easternmost state. It is located on the northern portion of the island of Borneo. It is the second largest state in the country after Sarawak, which it borders on its southwest. It also shares a border with the province of East Kalimantan of Indonesia in the south. In spite of its status as a Malaysian state, Sabah remains a disputed territory; the Philippines has a dormant claim over much of the eastern part of the territory. The capital of Sabah is Kota Kinabalu, formerly known as Jesselton. Sabah is often referred to as "Land Below The Wind", a phrase used by seafarers in the past to describe all the lands south of the typhoon belt.
