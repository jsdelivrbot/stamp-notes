# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Hanover

The Kingdom of Hanover - spelled Hannover
in German - one of theC Old German
States ,and a member of the German Confederation,
was situated in the northwest corner of Germany.


## Postal History

The Postal History of Hanover is strongly interwoven with that of [Brunswick](../brunswick/Introduction). An organized postal service for private mail existed from 1682, when the first postal regulations were established. The postal service of the "Reichpost", conducted by the Thurn and Taxis family, frequently encroached on the postal rights of Hanover but only in 1748 were the first Thurn and Taxis post offices established on Hanover territory. These services were only for the foreign mail with the domestic service remaining unchanged. At that time the service was known as "K\"onngliche und Churf\"urstliche Post", but after the union with Great Britain, the name "Konigliche Grossbritannische and Chufurstliche Barunschweig Luneburgsche Post" was adopted. In 1790 together with [Brunswick](../brunswick/Introduction), Hanover closed the post offices of the Reichpost and took over all postal work.

## Currency

The Hanover currency was the {{wi:Thaler}} (th), which was divided into 24 Gutegroschen (gg); The Thaler was a silver coin used throughout Europe for almost four hundred years. Its name lives on in the many currencies called dollar and until recently, the Slovenian tolar. One Gutegroschen was further divided into 30 Silbergroschen (sg), each equivalent to 12 Silverpfenning (spf). On October 1, 1858, the separate Hanover currency was abolished and the Silbergroschen currency was adopted.

## Paper

Tho paper of the adhesive was procureded
the paper mill of G. W. Quirll & Co.
of Osnahr\"uck. 

The paper of the first issue
was hand-made and coloured, except for the
3pfn which was on white paper. It had a
watermark, consisting for the first 1gg (on blue paper)
of 120 rectangles in stamp
size, which were formed by 11 vertical and 
13 horizontal watermark lines aoross the
sheet. 

For the other stamps, the rectangles
were slightly enlarged, duo to the larger
slze of the stamps and a wreath watermarrk,
consisting of two cross oak branches,
inserted in each rectngle. In this way,
each stamp had its individual watermark.


As the watermark was hand-made of wire, each watermark has its peculiarities, but the differences are indistinct to be of any help for the plating. Shifted watermarks can be found, but strongly shifted ones are rare exceptions. Inverted watermarks are known for all the issues. 






# 1859 

\ph[30%]{../hanover/1859-rose.jpg}{}

Typographed (?) on white wove paper, backed with rose-coloured gum. 32 vertical lines in central oval. Design very distinct, and very little hidden by the burele pattern. There are 4 of the vertical lines between outside of oval and H of HANNOVER. The letters of value (EIN DRITTET SILBF.RGROSCHEN) are small, and do not nearly fill up the space between the boundary lines of the scroll. None of the letters run into one another. Printed in deep dull carmine.

##  1863 Hanover Postage Stamp Issue

### Rouletting

The first issues of the adhesives were
issued imperforate and the introduction of
a special means of separation was considered
only in 18G3, probably following the example
of Bremen, as a similar kind of
separation help was used.

It was decided
to apply a roulette to the sheets of adhesives,
consistingg of semi-circular cuts,
of whieh there were 16 to a length of
2cm. 

To apply the roulettes two operations
were necessary for each sheet, one for the
11 vertical and one for the 13 horizontal
lines of roulette.

The rouletting was always
done from the face of the sheets, with
a handpress, in which the sharpened rouletting
llles were assembled in a form
similar to a printing form. Generally, on
the vertical lines, the tops of the semicircles
point to the left in the horizontal lines to the top. Two rouletting forms can be distinguished, the first one known used until the middle of 1865, had the semi-circles
of the last line at bottom with the tops pointed to the bottom. The second one, used from the middle of 1865, had the vertical line at the right with the tops pointing to the right. The normal position of the roulette on all stamps is with the tops of the semi-circles vertically to the left and horizontally to the top. 

The rouletting was normally done with care and the stamps are well centered, but in a number of cases a strongly shifted roulette can be found which resulted in badly centered stamps. Especially the 3pf can be found in copies where the roulette runs through the design and a number of such badly rouletted sheets were also found among the remainders. The 3pf is scarce in well centered copies, while such copies of other values are not difficult to obtain.

Several values are known with double roulette. There are also exist imperforate sheets of the rouletted issue, claimed to be unfinished remainders, but some of them seem to be proof sheets which were preserved, especially the 3pf on thin paper.

### Private Rouletting

Before official introduction of the roulette some case of private rouletting are reported from early 1863. Their status seems to be questionable.
