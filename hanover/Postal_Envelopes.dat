# Postal Envelopes

The first series of stamped envelopes was
issued on the 15th April, 1857. The design
consists of the profile of
King George V. to left,
in solid oval, in oval
engine turned border, inscribed,
above the portrait,
hannover, and below
EIN GUTER (1) GROSCHEN
; *the portrait and
the figure—which, on a
sn mil oval disk, intersects the value—are in white relief ; the lettering
is sunken ; the usual microscopic inscription,
EIN GUTER (or EIX, ZWEI, or DREI SILBER) groschen post couvert, printed in
green ink, crosses the left upper corner in
which the stamp is struck ; the values and
colours are the same as those of the adhesive
set.

\phmargin[30%]{../hanover/envelope.jpg}{The first issue, the value tablet is at the bottom of the stamp.}
\phmargin[30%]{../hanover/second-issue.jpg}{The second issue, the value has now moved to the two sides of the stamp.}

The second series—issued on the 1st October, 1858, a few months in advance of the corresponding adhesives—differs from the first in the value, and in the possession of two
circular disks in the border, one on either side of the profile, instead of the single oval disk at foot; said disks in the second series being in white relief, with the numeral
of value sunk in the centre. Of this series three editions appeared, all with green
diagonal inscriptions
.
Entire original envelopes of this series are
scarce, but all the values have been reprinted
on bluish tinted paper. A specimen
of the 1 g.gr. was discovered by M. Moens,
struck in rose, with the diagonal inscription
reading thus : ein probe post couvert
(postage envelope proof), instead of the usual
inscription. This proof envelope was probably
an experiment.\sidenote{Mentioned in Stamp Collecting, 1877, page 256.}

It will be seen that the first and third editions are substantially the same, the only
difference being in the shade ; hence the difficulty in distinguishing with certainty, between them is excessive, whilst the necessity for collecting both is questionable.

The appearance of the third edition, however, was neither due to whim nor accident. It was in
compliance with a suggestion of the Prussian post-office that the second edition, with
stamp to right, was issued ; but the Hanoverians had become so accustomed to the envelopes
with stamp to left, that they loudly objected to the innovation, protesting that the stamp in its new position stood in the way of the address. Such is the force of habit. We, on our side, should probably be equally dissatisfied were our post-office to take to issuing envelopes with the stamps to left. However, the Hanoverians got their way. The stamp-to-right envelopes were withdrawn, and the third series, above catalogued, was issued.

Originals of the first two editions are getting comparatively scarce ; the members of the third are, however, easily to be had, and reprints of the first two are likewise plentiful. Even today some very nice used examples can be had for 10 EUR or less in bulk lots.  

## Cancellations

For the Envelopes, special regulations existed for the cancelling. The envelope stamps were not to be cancelled but the postmark applied to the top right corner of the envelope. As long as the envelope stamp was in the top left corner, this worked satisfactorily and we rarely find cancelled envelope stamps (\ref{cancelled}), but those became more frequent between 1861 and 1863 when the position of the envelope stamp was moved to the top right corner of the
envelope. But generally, the large majority of all envelope stamps remained uncancelled.
