# Hanover Postal Rates

Postal rates for the period 1840-1860 depended on the weight. The period of stamps usage 1840-1860 saw a trend to lower the postal rates and make cheap mail available. [R Frajola exhibit](http://www.rfrajola.com/rf2014/RFT.pdf) The postal rates were complicated by the fact that until September 30, 1858 the domestic rates were featured in Gutegroschen currency, while the foreign rates were established in Silbergroschen currency.

The unit of weight was the hanover Pound, equivalet to 467.7 grams. It was divided into 32 {{wi:Hanover Loth}} each equivalent t0 about 1/2 ounce. From Oct 1, 1858, there was introduced the German Pound, divided into 30 Loth. One German Loth was equivalent to 1 1/8 Hanover Loth. Distances were measured in Hanover Miles, each equivalent to 7419 meters.


Definite rates were introduced on October 1, 1850, just before the first adhesives were issued.

In the domestic service --- which included teh Hanover post offices abroad --- letters paig 1 Gg up tp 1 1/8 Han. loth, 2gg from 1 1/8 up to 2 1/4 Han loth, 3 gg from 2 1/4 up to 4 1/2 Han. loth and 4 gg from 4 1/2 up to 9 Han. loth.

Letters over 9 Han loth paid 1gg for each additional 1 1/8 Han. loth.

For samples, the same fees applied, while for printed matter a reduced rate of 1/4gg for each Han. loth was in force.

## Registration

The registration fee was 1gg, the fee for a return receipt was also 1gg. The delivery fee was 2gpf. Local mail was 3gpf without regard to weight and in 1853 a reduced rate of 1/2gg (6gpf) was introduced, for local mail to and from the rural districts.
