# 1916 Bush Telegraphs

At the beginning of the Great War, German East Africa possessed a telegraph system whose lines for the most part ran along the coast or followed the Central and Northern Railroads. This was of little value to the German forces in the field, especially after their withdrawl into the South of the Protectorate. The Nachrichtentruppe (Signal Corps) strung field telegraph lines between Schutztruppe hedquarters and the major subsidiary commands whenever the front stabilized enough to allow for this. Messages were taken by native runners from the receiving telegraph operator to the various base camps in the area.
