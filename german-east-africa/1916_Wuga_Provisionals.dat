## 1916 Wuga Provisionals
In March, 1916, the most needed values (2 1/2h, 7 1/2h and 1 rupee) were delivered to postal headquarters at {{wi:Morogoro}}, but were never used, since the blockade runner "Marie" arrived from Germany with a fresh supply of stamps at about the same time. The Wuga issue was buried in a cement drain on a plantation near Morogoro later in 1916 (to avoid capture by the British). After the war, the stamps were exhumed in very bad condition, with a small fraction still intact and auctioned at Berlin in 1922.
