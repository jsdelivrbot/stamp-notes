\section{Croatia}

This is an  outline of the postage stamps and postal history of Croatia.
Croatia began to issue its own stamps in 1918, as part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (prior to this Croatia was part of Austria-Hungary which issued its own stamps). This continued until 1921, when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes began issuing its own.

After the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia in 1941, issuing of stamps resumed until 1945. 


With the independence of the Republic of Croatia in 1991, this again resumed with the Croatian Post handling the duty.
