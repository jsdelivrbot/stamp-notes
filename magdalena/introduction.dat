\chapter{Stamps and Postal History of Magdalena}

The United States of Colombia (1862-85) consisted of nine original States: Antioquia, [Bolivar](../bolivar/introduction), Boyaca, Cundinamarca, Panama, Santander, Cauca, Magdalena\footnote{Cauca and Magdalena did issue "stamps", but they are not presently listed in Scott.}, and Tolima. Naturally, all of them  issued stamps as early as 1863. After a new constitution was adopted in 1886, the States became Departments, losing their sovereignty. But the Departments retained some rights, including issuing stamps as late as 1904. 

It should be noted that Panama left the Republic in 1903.
