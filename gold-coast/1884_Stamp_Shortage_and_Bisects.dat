340  	 	WINNEBAH - THE UNIQUE 'TRI-QUADRISECT' FRANKING FOR THE 3d INTERNAL RATE TO ACCRA; Long commercial 24 July 1884 front (crease clear of stamp and marks; 229x116 mm) addressed to "E.W.L. Papa Fio Esq., Accra" franked for the 3d rate by three-quarters of the 1876-84 4d magenta (the top diagonal quarter cut away - presumably to be used as a 1d quadrisect) well tied by an almost very fine "C"-code "WINNEBAH" c.d.s., with a further mostly fine strike, and a mostly fine "C"-code "ACCRA" c.d.s. (26 July), at left. There is a red crayon "3d" replacing the similar red "2d" across the address, suggesting some accounting confusion in the Post Office. This remarkable franking (uncatalogued by SG, who rate the much commoner bisected & quartered 4d at \pound5,000 and \pound6,500 on cover respectively) is unique; there is only one other example recorded - on small piece only, dated 26 June 1884, also from Winnebah - which is in the Queen's Collection. [See John Wilson; also John Sacher, p.193.] This is arguably the rarest of all genuine Gold Coast dissected frankings; its survival on a genuine internal front is particularly surprising. 
Highly Important Exhibition Item.
