\chapter{The Ashanti Wars}

\section{The 1873-74 Expedition}

On 22nd January 1873 a large force of Ashanti, under King Kofi (some publications show this spelled as Koffee), 
crossed the Prah and approached the coast,
attacking Elmina and threatening Cape Coast. Major General Sir Garnet Wolseley landed at Cape Coast Castle on
4th October and began to drive the Ashanti out of the territory, the first full scale battle being the defence of
Abracrampa. The main push to Coomassee was in two sections. The primary force, under Sir Garnet Wolseley with a
secondary force under Captain Glover. The main force reached Prahsu on the Prah without incident and pushed on to
Coomassee. The main battle being at Amoaful on 31st January 1874 with further resistance at Ordahsu. The frightful
city of Coomassee was levelled to the ground and the troops returned to the coast.
