##History

The first Europeans to arrive at the coast were the Portuguese, in 1471. 
Upon their arrival, they encountered a variety of African kingdoms 
some of whom controlled substantial deposits of gold in the soil. 
In 1482, the Portuguese built the Castle of Elmina, the first European settlement on the Gold Coast. 
From here they traded slaves, gold, knives, beads, mirrors, rum and guns.

News spread quickly, and eventually, English, Dutch, Danish, Prussian and Swedish traders arrived as well. These European traders built several forts along the coastline. The Gold Coast had long been a name for the region used by Europeans, due to the large gold resources found in the area, although slave trade was the principal exchange for a number of years.
The first British Settlement at the {{wi:Gold_Coast}} was made in 1650 when England bought certain forts from the Danes, building another at {{wi:Kormantine}}
followed by Cape Coast Castle in 1661. These were destroyed by the Dutch durin 1664 and 1665,
being rebuilt by the royal African Company in 1672. The Dutch held settlements on the coast until 1871. 

Soon after 1807 Sierra Leone, Gambia and Gold Coast were united and known as the West African Settlements, from which the British
Governmnet withdrew in 1828, leaving the Colony to private enterprise until 1843. In that year year Gold Coast was united with Sierra Leone
until 1850, when it became a separate Colony.

In 1901 Ashanti and the Northern Territories were annexed. (See West African Wars).
