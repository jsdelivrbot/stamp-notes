\section{Provisional Stamps of 1901}   

A shortage of 1d Gold Coast stamps arose due to the change to a new 1d letter rate effective December 1898 and a reported 400% increase in mail volume form 1900 to 1901.

\ph[30%]{../gold-coast/6750.jpg}{Lot: 913	Sale: 30 Gold Coast: 1901 1d. on 6d. 
dull mauve and violet, with variety ''ONE'' omitted, fine and fresh mint. R.P.S. Certificate (1991). 
S.G. 36a, cat \pound275.   Price Realised \pound140 } 

The 2 1/2d and 6d values were overprinted "\textsc{ONE PENNY}" using the same 60 set overprint form, each sheet therefore passed twice through the press. A number of varieties are described in Robson Lowe\RLII{338} and Sacher (2003).
