###1875-1876 The First Issues

The first adhesive stamps were printed by De La Rue & Co. Many stamps normally bear very heavy cancellations. The first three
stamps were 1 penny blue, 4 penny magenta and 6d orange. 

They were printed from key and duty plates-the latter held only 60 replicas; each sheet therefore passed the press three times.
