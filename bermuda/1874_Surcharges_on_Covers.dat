##Bermuda

Owing to the fact that the 3d. stamp ran out of stock, the following provisionals
were made locally. Three types of the surcharge were utilised. The stamps were
surcharged by hand by Sergeant Maddox of the Royal Engineers.

\ph[30%]{../bermuda/32.jpg}{S.G. #13, 1874 "Three Pence" surcharge on 1/- Green, surcharge in italic capitals with plain "P", an especially fresh mint example, possessing strong vibrant color and impression on bright paper, attractively centered, o.g., nearly very fine for this, particularly when one compares this to most existing copies, many of which are found terribly off center, without gum and/or with faults; ex-Gibralter (Scott #12; $2,850.00).   	\pound2,500 Gross Sale, SS October 3, 2008 SOLD for $1,600.00.}

The stamps were issued in small quantities as shown below,

###1874 Surcharges on Cover

Coverss of the 1874 surcharges are very rare and no blocks are known of the surcharges. 

\ph[90%]{../bermuda/1059.jpg}{
1059  	 	THE FAMOUS "PLAIN P IN PENCE" 3d SURCHARGE 7d-RATE COVER TO G.B. VIA NEW YORK WITH A PAIR PLUS A SINGLE 1d; 4 June 1874 env. (closed tear across top left corner just clear of 1d value & small repair at left of address panel) to GB endorsed "Via New York" with a Unique(?) Franking for the rare 7d rate; the Horizontal Pair of the 1874 "THREE PENCE" on 1/- Green Surcharges with plain "P" in "PENCE" (SG13; cat. \pound8,500+ as a single on cover) and a regular 1865 1d Rose-red all tied by fortunately light Hamilton "1" barred oval numerals, with a matching very fine "HAMILTON/BERMUDA" c.d.s. alongside. There is also a very fine red "PAID/LIVERPOOL/US PACKET" c.d.s. on the front and a 22 June Gosport backstamp. This famous cover (now no longer with its contents as noted in the Ludington catalogue) realised \pound8,625 in the 1999 Morris Ludington auction - it is one of the most Important Bermuda Covers of all and a Major Exhibition Item.  	\pound7500}
