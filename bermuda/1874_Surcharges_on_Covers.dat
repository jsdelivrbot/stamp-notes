# March 1874 THREE PENCE surcharges

Owing to the fact that the 3d. stamp ran out of stock, the following provisionals
were made locally. Two types of the surcharge were utilised. The stamps were
surcharged by hand by Sergeant Maddox of the Royal Engineers. They are catalogued by Stanley Gibbons as SG12-SG14.

The stamps were issued in small quantities as shown below,

\begin{tabular}{llcc}

## 3d on 1d rose In Fancy Capitals (SG 12)

A lower left pane of sixty of the 1d rose-red stampss was surcharged. Though not authorised for postal use, a few were later used. These fascinating stamps are fully described on pages 247-251 of the Ludington handbook with the block illustrated in \ref{sg12} shown  page 245 of the book. The block first appeared in the Ludington collection and then re-appeared in the David J. Saul sale. It was last seen in the Vestey collection (Spink Dec 2015) and from where the image was obtained. It was estimated at £50,000 to £60,000.
