##Bermuda

Owing to the fact that the 3d. stamp ran out of stock, the following provisionals
were made locally. Three types of the surcharge were utilised.


###1874 Surcharges on Cover



\ph[90%]{../bermuda/1059.jpg}{
1059  	 	THE FAMOUS "PLAIN P IN PENCE" 3d SURCHARGE 7d-RATE COVER TO G.B. VIA NEW YORK WITH A PAIR PLUS A SINGLE 1d; 4 June 1874 env. (closed tear across top left corner just clear of 1d value & small repair at left of address panel) to GB endorsed "Via New York" with a Unique(?) Franking for the rare 7d rate; the Horizontal Pair of the 1874 "THREE PENCE" on 1/- Green Surcharges with plain "P" in "PENCE" (SG13; cat. \pound8,500+ as a single on cover) and a regular 1865 1d Rose-red all tied by fortunately light Hamilton "1" barred oval numerals, with a matching very fine "HAMILTON/BERMUDA" c.d.s. alongside. There is also a very fine red "PAID/LIVERPOOL/US PACKET" c.d.s. on the front and a 22 June Gosport backstamp. This famous cover (now no longer with its contents as noted in the Ludington catalogue) realised \pound8,625 in the 1999 Morris Ludington auction - it is one of the most Important Bermuda Covers of all and a Major Exhibition Item.  	\pound7500}
