1044  	 	EARLIEST KNOWN (?) USAGE OF THE BERMUDA 1st GOVERNMENT ISSUE ON COVER - 1/- RATE TO G.B. WITH RARE RED HAMILTON "PAID/H" P5 C.D.S.; Fine 28 Sept. 1865 env. (flap lost) to London endorsed "Via Halifax" and franked by a 1st Issue 1/- Green (slight corner wrinkle does not detract) tied by a loverly strike of the Hamilton barred "2" Numeral in black, but also having a very fine rare red Hamilton "BERMUDA/H/PAID" c.d.s. (normally struck in black on stamped covers from at least as early as Nov. 1865) alongside, with a fine red 2 Oct. London arrival c.d.s. It appears that no earlier cover with this first official Bermuda issue has been recorded (only a handful of 1865 usages on cover are known), though official records indicates (and SG lists) the date of 
issue as 25 Sept. 1865. Important early stamped cover. PHOTO.  	£750

MALLABY HIGGS./Bermuda" cachet (much the finer of the two recorded examples) nicely placed on the lower flap; charged as an unpaid incoming Ship Letter on arrival at Boston with very fine "SHIP" and "6" marks on the front matching the adjacent mostly v. fine "BOSTON/MASS./*" 'cork' Duplex alongside.

There is also a large part red "PAID/LIVERPOOL/BR. PACKET" c.d.s. (16 Nov.) on the front and partial/faint backstamps of "[Aden to Bombay] SEA POST OFFICE" and "THY[ETMYO]" (2? Jan.). [The similar but later - 1874 - 1d-Rate cover in the Sattin Collection was only addressed to G.B. and still sold for £5,175.] An amazingly rare destination for an early Bermuda cover and doubly significant being a 1st Issue Concession Rate cover. Unique?! PHOTO.  	£2000
