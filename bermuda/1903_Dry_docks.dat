\chapter{1903 The Dock Type}  

This type is reported by Robson Lowe as having followed the design of the badge of Bermuda. Two essays were made in 1896, one of which was approved on 8.8.1901.

The design is after the badge of Bermuda, showing a three-deck ship at the entrance of the dock gates with two other ships in the background, one being a schooner under sail. The dies were engraved by L.V. Philips.
