VIA NEW YORK (WITH IRELAND ISLAND DUPLEX); Attractive 23 Dec. 1891 env. to Sheffield headed & countersigned (initials) for the Concession Rate for a "Seaman, H.M.S.

OVERPRINT ON 11⁄2d RED POSTAL STATIONERY POSTCARD USED IN THE CORRECT (2-MONTH) PERIOD; 5 July 1893 Commercial usage of the Bermuda 11⁄2d Red PC with 1st July 1893 "One/Penny." overprint from "Prospect Camp, Bermuda" to a Railway Co. Secretary in London, cancelled by a light "HAMILTON/B/BERMUDA/1" Duplex. As noted in the SG catalogue, the 1893 Provisional 1d+1⁄2d Postcards are very rare but all appear to have been used philatelically. Less well known is the contemporary use of the same Overprint on existing stocks of 11⁄2d Red P. Stationery PCs, which were only needed from 1 July 1893 until the appearance of the 1d cards in Sept. 1893, and of which only 6,116 were printed. Only a handful of correctly used examples of the 1d on 11⁄2d PC, used in the correct July - Sept. 1893 period, such as this, are recorded. PHOTO.  	£300
