\ph[80%]{../bermuda/1037.jpg}{
1037  	 	SAILOR's 1d CONCESSION RATE COVER TO G.B. VIA IRELAND HEADED FROM "H.M.S. EURYDICE, BERMUDA"; 7 Jan. 1855 env. (some dusting) to London headed (and unusually dated) & countersigned for the 1d Concession Rate for "John Wilson, Ship's Steward's Assistant on Board H.M.S. Eurydice, Bermuda" franked by a GB 1d Red 'stars' cancelled (on arrival), but not tied, by the London "22" diamond numeral; intriguingly there are backstamps of "QUEEN[STOWN]" (16 Mar.) and Dublin (17 Mar.) as well as London (19 Mar.), which suggests that whatever vessel it was that took the letter from Bermuda made its first landfall at the busy Irish naval port of Queenstown (formerly Cove), which is most unusual. Further research required. Rare and early 1d Concession Rate cover from Bermuda.  \pound500.}

\ph[80%]{../bermuda/1038.jpg}{
1038  	 	OFFICER's 6d CONCESSION RATE NAVAL COVER TO G.B. WITH G.B. 1d REDS STRIP OF SIX; Attractive 21 Apr. 1856 env. (minor dusting) to London (redirected on arrival with delivery endorsements on back and London Stepney "SY" mis-sort mark on the front) headed (beneath the stamps, which are now hinged to the cover - they originally overlapped the top edge and have various minor faults, but they were tied between the perfs at one point) "From H.M.S. Cornwallis, Bermuda" (from an Assistant Surgeon) and additionally endorsed "Bermuda" and dated at bottom left; the stamps were tied by the London "4" Diamond numerals on arrival in London (as normal for this kind of Ship's Bag mail). As it happens the normal civilian rate was also 6d from Bermuda at this time. Very rare and unusual 6d Naval Officer's cover and an exceptional overseas usage of GB 1d Reds. [Ex Tucker, 1978 & Ex Ludington, 1999.]    	\pound750

Nile" franked by a GB 1d Red 'stars' tied (on arrival) by the London "4(?)0" diamond numeral with 27 June arrival backstamps (which tie in with SS 'Delta'/'La Plata' carriage via St. Thomas). HMS Nile was the new W. Indies Station flagship, just arrived from England (the writer describes the voyage out inc. two deaths, etc.). Rare and attractive.   \pound750

1043  	 	NAVAL COVER SENT BY PRIVATE MEANS FROM BERMUDA FRANKED WITH 1d RED CANCELLED ON ARRIVAL; 12/31 Jan. 1880 env. (+ contents headed "HMS Northampton, Bermuda" ref. overwork and with an intriguing PS; "Have no proper stamps. None to be got." - presumably he needed a 6d stamp for the Officer's rate) apparently carried by the "[HMS] Bellerophon which sails today for Portsmouth", so presumably franked on arrival with a GB 1d Red (pl.196) as if an inland letter, tied by a v. fine Portsmouth duplex. Rare example of the smuggling of a letter by Naval SHip and thereby saving 5d postage! Fine and unusual.    	\pound200
