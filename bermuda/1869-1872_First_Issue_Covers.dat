RED "BERMUDA/PAID" DATESTAMP (P1) ON LOCAL 1d-RATE COVER; Attractive long 11 Oct. 1845 env. (some flaps reduced) from "G. James Tucker" (filing note inside) addressed to the Attorney General in "Hamilton" and endorsed "O.H.M. Service" but prepaid the internal 1d postage with a red manuscript "1d" at right and a very fine (for this) red P1 St. Georges "BERMUDA/oPAIDo" c.d.s. also on the front. Rare thus; 
early local mail is seldom seen, and this is as fine a strike of 
this mark as we have seen. [Ex Ulrich, 1989.]    	£750
