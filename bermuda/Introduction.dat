##Bermuda

According to the Spanish historian Ferdinand d'Oveida the islands were discovered
by the Spanish Navigator Juan Bermudez and after whom the islands are named. No
permanent settlement was made by the Spaniards. 

Apart from the [Perot stamps](../bermuda/Postmasters_Local_Provisionals) which were a local issue and which are so scarce that 
few collectors can possess one, Bermuda, although one of the older British colonies, 
only entered the adhesive stamp-issuing world in 1865. It was a result of the Act of 
1864, no 28, which was quite comprehensive and which inter alia, enacted rates of 
postage: 

Inland: Letters and Parcels 1d. per ounce 

Newspapers free 

Books 1d. per volume. 

to B.W.I. and British North America: 6d. per half ounce, to United 

Kingdom: l/- per half ounce. 

Thus there was a requirement for stamps of at least three denominations, 1d., 6d. 
and l/-. By 1865 Perkins Bacon were out of favour with the Crown Agents and De La 
Rue were taking over the printing of stamps for the Colonies more and more, so the 
first Bermudan stamps supplied by the Crown Agents were printed by De La Rue. That 
meant, of course, that they used the process they favoured, surface printing, following 
the superb engraving work by Jean Joubert. Production problems were not unknown so 
that, although the printing was generally of a high standard, well-centred copies are 
quite scarce. 
In 1866 a 2d. stamp was issued

In 1872 the postage rate to British North America was reduced to 3d. per half 
ounce. When requesting a supply of 3d. stamps the Colonial Secretary of Bermuda 
added "Also we should prefer the effigy (of Her Majesty) to be in a different style, viz:- 
one representing Her Majesty at her present age in her ordinary head dress of ceremony 
all of which may he copied from any good recent engraving or photograph." Probably 
he had in mind a stamp recently issued in Newfoundland; but whilst no record exists 
regarding what happened to the suggestion, 10,000 3d. stamps bearing the usual 
Queen's head were supplied five months later. In less than 12 months the stock was 
exhausted and the Postmaster General of Bermuda was authorised to issue one shilling 
postage stamps as threepenny stamps with a distinct [surcharge](../bermuda/1874_Surcharges_on_Covers) on them. 
 
A few 1d. stamps were also surcharged THREE PENCE but these are considered to 
be essays and were not originally supposed to have been issued although, in fact, some 
apparently passed through the post genuinely. Forgeries, some of them dangerous, of 
both these rarities exist. 
 
In 1875 stocks of the 1d. value were exhausted so, only 12 months after the first 
provisionals, it was necessary to resort to the same procedure again: 2d., 3d. and l/- 
stamps were overprinted 'One Penny.' Much of the type used was worn and contained 
damaged letters, breaks and missing serifs. Rarities are the varieties of 1d. on 2d. and 
1d. on l/- with the Full Stop missing; there are dangerous forgeries of them too. 
 
In 1872 the rates on letters to foreign European countries were made uniform at 
8½d. per half ounce. Bermuda had no halfpenny stamp but the situation was relieved 
four years later by an increase in the rate to 9d. 
 
Discussions between the United States and Bermuda ended in a Postal Convention, 
operative from 1st October 1876, by which the postage rate from Bermuda to the 
U.S.A. was to be reduced to 2½d. per half ounce. However Bermuda still had no 
halfpenny stamp so the rate for all half-ounce letters was 2d. until a halfpenny stamp 
was eventually issued in 1880. In the intervening four years the Bermudan Post Office 
lost 1d. on every half-ounce letter to the U.S.A. 
 
Late in 1876 the rate on letters to the U.K. by some routes was reduced to 6d. per 
half ounce, and on 1st April 1879 the rate by all routes was reduced to 4d. per half 
ounce. Thus a 4d. stamp was very desirable: this was issued in 1880 on the same day 
as the ½d. stamp. 
 
Until this time stamps had been printed on paper watermarked Crown CC but 
during 1882 De La Rue & Co. started using paper watermarked Crown CA and as 
further supplies of stamps were required they were supplied on paper with the new 
watermark. The 1d. stamp was the first, in 1883, and although used in the same year, 
the change was not noticed until 1886. Other values followed, sometimes printed in 
different colours, and a 2½d. value was introduced in 1884 essentially for the letter rate 
to the United States. It was also very useful for the 2½d. per half ounce rate to England 
prevailing from 1st January 1894. 
 
Apart from the overprints many of the above stamps are very reasonably priced 
even now and they can make one or more interesting pages. Covers which illustrate the 
various rates of postage mentioned above are attractive.

Late in 1900 it was decreed that newspapers which had previously been conveyed 
free on the island should be charged at the rate of ¼d. per two ounces as from 1st 
January 1901. This did not allow much time for the production of a ¼d. stamp so De 
La Rue were instructed by the Crown Agents to overprint some l/- stamps printed in a 
distinct colour; grey was chosen. 
 
The first consignment was put on sale on 11th January 1901 and the 1000 sheets 
(240,000 stamps) were sold within 24 hours; they were mostly bought by speculators! 
Until a new supply was obtained newspapers were conveyed free, as before, but in 
March 190) a further 486,000 stamps arrived and in September 1901 488,000 more 
arrived: these lasted until 1908! Even to-day, over half a century later, mint blocks of 
these stamps are easy to find and are inexpensive. 
 
In 1902 the first of the [Dock](../1903_Dry_Docks) type was issued and others followed until the 4d. 
value in 1909. During the eight years of currency these issues appeared in three forms, 
with watermark Crown CA, watermark Multiple Crown CA and lastly in Universal 
colours. None of the three was issued for long and it is not surprising, therefore, that 
covers bearing the stamps are scarce. The design, regarded as inartistic, was unpopular; 
before many years a desire for a change was expressed. 
 
In 1909 a committee was appointed to organise celebrations to commemorate the 
300th anniversary of the wreck of a ship and the landing from it of Admiral Sir George 
Somers near St. Georges in July 1609. One of the committee's proposals was the issue 
of a special set of stamps to be valid only during the celebrations. The idea was not 
looked upon with favour but it led to the suggestion that there should be a new 
permanent issue and so there evolved the "Ship" type, a very pleasing design indeed. It 
formed the general issue, up to l/- value, from 1910 to 1936. 
 
In those 26 years there was a change of watermark, there were shades of most 
values in both watermarks and changes of colour of a few values. 
 
Most interesting of all, however, is the ingenious method used for the production of 
the stamps: De La Rue used the line-engraved process, but with a difference. 
Although several values of stamps were involved they only produced one steel plate 
with 120 impressions (without value) in the orthodox way. Then they look lead 
impressions from the steel plate, under hydraulic pressure. Each lead sheet obtained 
was immersed in a battery so that copper would be deposited and thus copper plates 
grown on them; afterwards the lead was removed leaving impressions in the copper. 
Duties indicating the value of the stamps were carefully engraved in the blank space of 
each stamp and then the plates were ready for use. 
 
In any process where the engraved impression is transferred to a contacting 
medium, a small amount of definition of the engraving is lost at each transfer. Even 
the stamp productions of Perkins Bacon which involved two transfers are not quite so 
well defined as die proofs. By now De La Rue were extending the process by a further 
two transfers first onto lead and finally onto copper. Thanks to the extremely high 
quality of work the final results were quite acceptable but it cannot be denied that many 
of the edges of the lines of ink in the common design are not very sharply defined. 
 
The extension of the process had the advantage that once the steel master plate had 
been made, there was a saving in labour for the production of the copper plates from

which the stamps were printed. But despite all the care taken in making the master 
plate, it was necessary to make fresh entries with the transfer roller on it before the lead 
impressions were taken; there are also some retouches. The features of these fresh 
entries and retouches appear on stamps of all values. There are several retouches on the 
copper plates also: these, of course, do not repeat on stamps of other values and printed 
from other plates. 
 
Even this is not all. Stamps of the four values most commonly used (¼d., ½d., 1d. 
and 2½d.) were produced in sheets of 120, the lead sheets used having 120 impressions 
on them from the steel master plate. But stamps of the other five values (2d., 3d., 4d., 
6d. and l/-) were printed in sheets of 60, the lead sheets having only covered the left 
hand vertical half of the master plate and so having only 60 impressions on each of 
them. Thus the numbering of stamps having the same master plate retouch in the two 
sizes of sheets will be different: for example No. 10 in a sheet of 120 corresponds to 
No. 4 in a sheet of 60, and No. 80 in a sheet of 120 corresponds to No. 38 in a sheet of 
60. 
 
Some of the copper plates of the commonly used values were replaced during the 
26 years of issue of the stamps, there being four plates of the 1d. value in this way. 
Each of them had retouches. 
 
Finally, when a 1½d. stamp was required in 1934, De La Rue started again and used 
a re-engraved die with the figures of value included. Thus the stamps were printed 
from a plate bearing 120 impressions made by the transfer roller. The improvement in 
appearance and clearness of the lines is readily seen: and there is no variety! 
 
The issues of the "Ship" type are fascinating: they include two watermarks, shades 
and changes of colour, fresh entries and retouches on the master plate and retouches on 
the printing plates. Truly, a most interesting hunting ground for philatelists)

The Postal Surtax Act was passed and came into operation in May, 1918; it was 
designed to augment the revenue of the Colony, there being a penny surtax on every 
letter going outside the islands to which the rate of postage on letters was 1d. per ounce 
or fraction of an ounce. 1d. " Ship " type stamps were locally overprinted WAR TAX. 
The two words extended nearly the full width of each stamp so that, when being 
overprinted, careful positioning of the sheets of stamps was necessary to avoid part of 
one of the end letters of the overprint being omitted from the stamp. In the third 
printing of these War Tax stamps, early in 1920, the words forming the overprint were 
of a different, smaller type so the same precision of centring was no longer required. 
 13 
Until 1918 Bermuda had no stamp of face value more than 1/- nor any stamp 
bearing the head of King George V. Higher value stamps were authorised in 1917 and, 
as a measure of economy during World War I, the design adopted was the large 
Nyasaland keyplate type: they were inscribed Postage and Revenue although, at the 
time, they were required more for purposes of revenue than postage. 2/6, 5-, 10/- and 
£1 values were issued in April, 1918, and 2/- and 4/- values were issued two months 
later, all printed on Multiple Crown CA paper. There was only one printing of each of 
the 2/-, 2/6 and 4/- values but two of the 10/- and three of the 5/-: however only minor 
varieties of shades of inks occur in them. The £1 remained in use for twenty years 
during which time several printings were made; these gave variations both in the colour 
of the purple ink and of the paper. 
 
The first of the high value stamps to appear on paper watermarked Multiple Crown 
Script CA was the 10/-, in 1924; the 2/- and 2/6 values appeared three years later and 
stamps of a new value, 12/6, were issued in 1932. The 2/- appeared in three distinctive 
shades and the 2/6 in several shades of inks and of paper; of the 2/6 value the widest 
range of shades occurs in the red of the frame of the design, ranging from bright 
crimson-red to scarlet and orange vermilion. The appearance of some of the stamps 
gives the impression that the inks were oily though they have not affected the backs of 
the stamps. Several of these 2/6 values, each different, can make one or two very 
attractive and interesting pages in a collection. The 10/- and 12/6 values also had 
varieties in shades of inks and of paper. 
 
It is recorded in history that the Legislative Assembly of Bermuda first met on the 
1st August, 1620 and so it was not unnatural that tercentenary celebrations should be 
held in 1920, these to include a special issue of stamps. In March, 1920 the Governor 
forwarded his own suggestion for a design to the Crown Agents. Early in June, the 
Legislative Assembly informed the Governor that they had decided to commemorate 
the occasion by a special issue of stamps. He then advised them that he had already 
sketched a design and put forward an essay of his proposal, prepared by De La Rue at 
the request of the Crown Agents. The Assembly, however, did not agree with the 
design and so produced one of their own in which were incorporated the coat of arms 
of the colony, the sword of state and the Speakers gavel, emblems appropriate to the 
occasion. 
 
Since the production of stamps based on the Governor's design had already 
progressed so far and since stamps of the design produced by the Assembly could not 
be ready for several more months it was decided to have two series of stamps for the 
occasion, one of each design. The 1d. and 2½,d. values of stamps based on the 
Governor's design went on sale in November, 1920, the remaining seven values in 
January, 1921, all surface-printed. The stamps to the design approved by the 
Assembly were all issued in May, 1921; they were recess-printed. 
 
Both these issues were printed at the time of change-over from paper watermarked 
Multiple Crown CA to that watermarked Multiple Crown Script CA and so some 
values in each series, though not the same values, appear on paper watermarked 
differently from the others. Only very minor shades occur except of the 1/- value of

 both series; in these, there are shades of the colour of the paper. Most stamps of both 
issues are usually off centre but a patient search for centred copies can be quite 
rewarding! 
In April, 1936, Bermuda issued a series of nine pictorial stamps, recess-printed; 
four of them showed a portrait of King George V and so were issued posthumously. 
The ½d., 2d., 6d., and 1/6 values, however, did not incorporate a portrait of him and 
remained in use throughout the reign of King George VI, though the 2d. value was in 
different colours. It is noteworthy that ten printings were made of the 6d., some of 
which show marked differences of shades of both the red and violet colours. 
Pictorial stamps showing the head of King George VI were issued in January. 1938; 
these, together with the ½d., 2d., 6d. and 1/6 values just mentioned, completed the 
values required at the time. Some of the low value designs replaced the corresponding 
1936 ones and, altogether, this was a very pleasing issue. Shades of every value are to 
be found. A new denomination, 7½d., also a pleasing design, was added late in 1941 to 
meet the air-mail rate to the United States and Canada, changed to 7½d. per half-ounce. 
The King George VI high value stamps, 2/-, 2/6, 5/-, 10/-, 12/6 and £1, were also 
issued in January, 1938. Except that the head of King George VI faced the opposite 
way, the stamps were of the same general design as those previously issued with the 
head of King George V. Stamps of the first five values were printed on paper 
watermarked Multiple Crown Script CA whilst for the £1 value paper with the Multiple 
Crown CA was again used. Several printings of stamps of all values were made and 
varieties of shades of the inks used, of the papers on which they are printed and of the 
perforations make an attractive display. Some of the varieties occur because of the 
difficult conditions prevailing at the printers during war-time. 
In December, 1940, the postal rate for local Christmas cards in unsealed envelopes 
was ½d., and because further supplies of ½d. stamps from Britain had been delayed, 
stocks of them in Bermuda became exhausted. Stamps of the 1d. value were surcharged 
HALF PENNY near the top and an x over the former value in each of the lower 
corners. There are three settings, established by vertical spacings, and several minor 
varieties. An unsealed cover showing the stamp having been used as intended and 
correctly dated is pleasing. 
Bermuda issued three stamps of rather simple but neat design to commemorate the 
centenary of Postmaster Perot's stamp; although dated 1948 they were only put on sale 
in April, 1949. 
Following the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, a new series of definitive 
stamps was issued, breaking away from previous styles and tradition; the fourteen 
different designs each incorporated a feature relating to Bermuda. 
In the next few years Bermuda issued commemorative stamps for various reasons 
but the outstanding issue was of six stamps in 1959, the 350th anniversary of the 
landing of Admiral Sir George Somers and of the consequent settlement; the design 
depicts the Arms of King James I and Queen Elizabeth II and is very pleasing. How 
few of them one sees genuinely used on cover! 
The next definitive issue was made in 1962, a series of seventeen different designs. 
They were printed by photogravure by Harrison and Sons; being sketchy in appearance, 
they were disappointing. 
 
When decimal currency was introduced in 1970 they were surcharged, each with a 
new value. The surcharged series was only issued for five months before being 
superseded by a new definitive issue of sixteen stamps (" Flowers ") still in general use. 
Until now, Bermuda has limited its special commemorative issues to three or four 
per year: may it remain so! She has, of course, participated in omnibus issues but they, 
being of a general nature, have not been mentioned in this article. 

Postmarks: There are plenty to look for in 19th century marks, bar cancellations, 
duplex cancellations and datestamps. 20th century marks are normally circular 
datestamps and an example from each of the present post offices is not difficult to find. 
For a student of the Bermuda postal services, stamps and allied matter the standard 
works, Ludington's "Bermuda" and its Supplement are invaluable for reference.

The philately of Bermuda is well established due to the early efforts of Morris. H. Ludington who authored \textit{"Bermuda--the Handstruck Stamps and Cancellations"}(1956) and  "The Post Office, Postal markings and Adhesive Stamps of
Bermuda" (1962) and the supplement to the last (1968). There is also detailed
additional information in Robson Lowe's North American Encyclopaedia.
