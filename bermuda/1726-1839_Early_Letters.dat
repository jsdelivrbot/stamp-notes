### Bermuda 1726-1839 early Letters

According to Robson Lowe early letters coming from England were mentioned in Act No. 14 of 1662/23, but none appear to have survived at least in private hands.

RARE EARLY COVER SENT TO U.S. "BY WAY OF BARBADOS" BY PRIVATE SHIP, ETC.; 
Fine 14 Mar. 1773 EL (family letter) from "Bermuda" sent by 
private ship (Geoff's researches suggest the 'Dolphin', Capt. Dunscomb) "To Samuel 
Coates, Merchant in Philad[elphi]a" with interesting contents ref. the writer's 
convalescing in Bermuda for the winter, mentioning a previous (Jan. 1773) 
letter sent "by the way of Carolina", but most helpfully noting the route for this letter; "...this [letter] 
comes by way of Barbados". 
Possibly a unique 18th century routing from Bermuda, and one of the earliest known covers 
from Bermuda to the U.S. Plus unrelated 1819 Bermuda Bill of Lading (for a cargo to Quebec), 
a fine small coloured c.1880 map of the islands, 
and 2 PPCs. Good lot. (5 items) \pound500.}

<p style="font-size:smaller">
NAPOLEONIC WARS PERIOD - SHIP LETTER TO U.S. SIGNED BY "PEROT" BROS. REF. LOSS OF ORIGINAL & DUPLICATE, 
ETC.; Remarkable and fine 1 Sept.1795 EL from "Bermuda" to Philadelphia endorsed "p. Capt. Merser" having a fine black "2/OC" Philadelphia arrival Bishop Mark on the front, but not charged. [The 4d Ship Letter charge-mark has been omitted, but the rate was certainly due; c.f. Ludington lot of the same year & correspondence with the "4" charge-mark, which sold for &pound;1,725 in 1999.] The contents mention that the original and duplicate of an earlier letter from Philadelphia had both been lost in transit ("...must have fallen into improper hands..."!) though sent by different ships, but the triplicate had safely reached its destination (London) by a direct ship. Geoff's researches (research-notes included) have also shown that the ship that carried this letter (under Capt. Mercer) - the "Molly" - had just been released (minus its cargo originally bound from Bordeaux to Phila.!) having been taken by the Bermuda privateer "Thetis" two months before. A rare early cover with postal marks and proof of the dangerous seas of this wartime period. Further, the letter is signed by "James & Wm. Perot", 
the father and uncle of the future famous Bermuda Postmaster William B. Perot.    	&pound;850

###1812

<p style="font-size:smaller">
THE EARLIEST RECORDED(?) BERMUDA POSTAL CHARGE - 1st YEAR OF OFFICIAL P.O. - INCOMING SHIP LETTER; 
21 Aug. 1812 EL (overall light toning but sound) from "London" addressed to "Messrs. Wadson *& Astwood, Bermuda" being endorsed "P. [Ship] Catherine"; the letter would have reached the island in Sept./Nov. 1812 at which time the short-lived First Official P.O. Act was in operation (it as declared illegal by London within a year!). There is the very first incoming Bermuda Ship Letter charge of "1/3d" (triple rate) changed to "10d" (double rate) all in red crayon on the front, which fits exactly the Bermuda 1st P.O. Act charges (see full text of the Act in Ludington, esp. Article 3 ref. incoming Ship Letters, on p.112). We have not traced any other incoming Ship Letters of this early period (1812), so this may therefore be the earliest recorded Postage Due charge and, indeed the earliest postal marking of any kind, for Bermuda. There were no Bermuda P.O.
handstamps until 1820. Important Early P.O. charged cover. 
Important Exhibition Item.    	Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£500

<p style="font-size:smaller">
INTERNAL GOVERNOR's LETTER OF PERIOD WHERE NO LOCAL P.O. SERVICE WAS ALLOWED; 
Very fine 9 May 1829 EL sent privately (by Governor's servant presumably) from "Gov[ernment].
H[ouse], Mt. Langton" to "Hamilton" written (in the third person) and signed (on the address wrapper)
by the Governor of Bermuda, <strong>Sir Hilgrove Turner</strong>; the letter asks Mr. Ewing 
for entries from baptismal registers. There was no internal island mail service from its suspension in Oct. 1821 until its resumption in 1830. Rare local letter from the military hero Sir H. Turner who claimed (amongst other things) to have personally rescued the famous Rosetta Stone from 
the French in Egypt and escorted it back to Britain, 
where it remains in the British Museum.    	Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£300

<p style="font-size:smaller">
EARLIEST RECORDED(?) MAIL TO CANADA - LARGE FLEURON (PM2) ON COVER TO NOVA SCOTIA; 25 Feb./13 Mar. 1834 EL (toned and with worn crease; professionally laid down & re-backed but complete) from "Hamilton" unusually addressed to "Halifax, N.S." (ordering soap & wrapping-paper!) endorsed "P. Brig Standard, Capt. Burrows" with a fine small St. Georges "BERMUDA" fleuron (PM2) in faded red-brown on the lower flap (just shaved by crease); charged "41Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½2 [+] 1 [=] 51Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½2", being 4d sterling converted to 41Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½2d local currency plus the 1d local delivery. Very rare destination prior to 1840 from Bermuda; we have not traced any other covers to B.N.A./Canada 
with a Bermuda fleuron (almost all known examples are on covers to G.B.). Rare thus.    	Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£200
