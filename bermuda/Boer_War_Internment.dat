\chapter{Boer War Internment Camps}  

About 5000 Boer Prisoners of War were sent to Bermuda for internment by the Imperial
Government. The Boers were quartered in the Great Sound on Tucker's, Darrel's Burt's, Hawkin's, Morgan's and Hinson's Islands.

The first contigent arrived on 28th June 1901 and the last of them were freed at the last part of 1904. Letters from these camps are keenly sought out by both Bermuda
Collectors as well as those who study the Anglo-Boer War.
