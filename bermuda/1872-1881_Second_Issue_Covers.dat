1023  	 	THE UNIQUE IRELAND ISLAND COVER WITH BOTH POSTMASTER GROTE's HANDSTRUCK "4d" (ONE OF 3 KNOWN) & "6d" MARKS; Remarkable 18 Apr. 1861 env. (closed opening-tears at foot & small stain on RH edge both clear of marks) prepaid to "Saranac Hollow, Clinton County, New York", endorsed "Paid" and "via Halifax" in red, having a black double-arc PM5 "IRELAND ISLE/BERMUDA" c.d.s. on the reverse (over-written by addressee's notes); there is also a very fine rare red Ireland Island Handstruck "6d" nicely placed on the front but crossed out in manuscript with a mostly very fine and very rare matching Ireland Island Handstruck "4d" alongside. Only three examples of the Ireland Island Handstruck "4d" have been recorded; the other two being on straightforward Crowned Circle covers to Canada. These 4d, 6d & 1/- marks were only used at the Ireland Island P.O. and are thought to have been produced on the initiative of the Postmaster, D. Grote; they - especially the 4d (3 known) and 1/- (one known) - are the P.H. equivalent of the (rather more expensive) Perot & Grote "Postmasters Stamps" and are just as rare. This exceptional combination of 4d and 6d marks both struck together is unique; the 6d Packet rate was correct to G.B., but the Packet rate to Canada was only 4d, hence the error. The 4d Packet rate was more expensive & slower than ordinary Ship Letters, hence the rarity of 4d mark. Important Exhibition Item; arguably the rarest of all Bermuda Prestamp covers.    	\pound3000

1026  	 	U.S. CIVIL WAR - BLOCKADE RUNNER COVER WITH THE RARE SMALL ST. GEORGES "BERMUDA/A/PAID" P4 C.D.S. (EARLIEST RECORDED DATE); Fine 23 May 1863 env. with original contents headed "Wilmington, N.C." addressed to "Oaks Sulphur Springs, Jefferson Co., M[iss]o[uri]" during the American Civil War (Jefferson had fallen to the Federal forces in 1861, so there was then no direct route from Wilmington); routed via Bermuda, Halifax (N.S.) and Boston, and so carried (under cover to Mr. A. H. Williams in St Georges) on the successful Blockade-runner vessel 'Cornubia' which left Wilmington on 24 May and reached Bermuda on 27 May 1863. The letter with this envelope was then posted from St. Georges on 3 June with a very fine (especially for this rare mark) small red encircled "BERMUDA/A/PAID" of St. Georges (PM4 - the Earliest Known Date of just 13 recorded examples) nicely placed on the front with red crayon "4[d]" and partial black "BOSTON/5" 23 June transit charge-datestamp. The contents - a Wilmington doctor's wife sending the news that the addressee's husband, also a doctor (who had recently volunteered to help treat the Yellow Fever sufferers in the town) had died of the fever himself. Of particular interest is the postscript giving instructions on how to reply; "...must be mailed as follows; 2 envelopes, the inner addressed to Mrs. Alex R. Midway, Wilmington, N.C., C.S.A. The outer to [the name in a different hand - presumably added in transit in Bermuda in case the letter had been captured en route; A.H. Williams Esqr. (via Halifax, N.S.)], St George, Bermuda, who will forward it by some one of our Confederate vessels." [Plus, again in the second handwriting; "It will be necessary to prepay the Postage, I Understand, to insure it reaching Bermuda".] This is a doubly rare cover - it has one of the rarest of all Bermuda's "PAID" marks, and it is is a U.S. Civil War Blockade-runner cover - with superb contents - that was sent successfully via Bermuda from a 'southern' state to a 'northern' state of America. Most recorded Bermuda blockade-runner covers are addressed to Britain, and mailed unpaid; there were none to the US in the Ludington Collection, and none that were prepaid from Bermuda. Highly Important Civil War and Bermuda Exhibition Item.    \pound3000

1027  	 	SHORT-LIVED HAMILTON ENCIRCLED P5 "BERMUDA/H/PAID" C.D.S. (EARLIEST RECORDED DATE) ON 1/- RATE COVER TO G.B.; 20 Jan. 1865 EL (horiz. fold clear of Bermuda marks) to London endorsed "Paid" and "Via Halifax" with a very fine (for this) red encircled Hamilton "BERMUDA/H/PAID" c.d.s. inverted on the front with a red crayon "11d" (the credit due to G.B. from the full 1/- that was actually prepaid when this letter was posted) nearby, having a faint "LONDON/PAID" arrival c.d.s. (crease) also on the front. This mark was only introduced in mid-1864 (though not recorded used until Jan. 1865) and postage stamps were introduced in Sept. 1865; so only 8 examples of this Hamilton "PAID" mark have been recorded so far.
