\chapter{1848-56 Postmaster's Local Provisionals}
From 1818 postmasters were permitted to retain any postage paid at their respective offices on inland mail. When the post office was closed a slot was provided in the door for mail to be posted with the necessary postage. Monies received and the number of letters posted did not always tally. Being required to forward all the mail, and rather than penalize those who had been honest, some mail was sent free. This resulted in the postmaster being cheated of part of his income. It was to counter this fraud that in 1848 William Perot, postmaster at Hamilton, introduced his "stamps" by utilising datestamps impressions, with day and months slugs removed, struck on pieces of paper, and endorsing them "One Penny" and with his signature. In later years William Perot and James Thies, postmaster at St. Georges, used Crowned Circle General Post Office stamps in a similar manner
