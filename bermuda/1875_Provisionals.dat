\chapter{1875 Provisionals}    

The "One Penny" provisionals were needed owing to the delay in ordering supplies of this value from England.

The stamps were overpinted locally by the Queen's printer, Donald McPhee Lee, who were the publishers of the Royal Gazette. They were posssibly surcharged in panes of 60.
