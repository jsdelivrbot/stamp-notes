In 1941 1.08 square miles were leased for 99 years (for naval and air bases) to
the Government of the United States of America, which later increased the area to 1.75 square miles by reclamation. 

The first American forces (Marines) arrived on Tucker's Island on 14th March 1941.
Approximately a month later on 18th April 1941 the first United States Army Post
Office was opened (APO). The Post Office was assigned the number 802, which was Fort Bell. It was in use until May 1942 when it was changed to Army Post Office 856. There
are also other markings for the Naval Operating Base at King's Point, Sandy's Parish (NOB 138).
