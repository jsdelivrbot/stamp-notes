# 1901 One Farthing Provisional

Late in 1900 it was decreed that newspapers which had previously been conveyed free on the island should be charged at the rate of ¼d. per two ounces as from 1st January 1901. This did not allow much time for the production of a ¼d. stamp so De La Rue were instructed by the Crown Agents to overprint some l/- stamps printed in a distinct colour; grey was chosen.

The first consignment was put on sale on 11th January 1901 and the 1000 sheets (240,000 stamps) were sold within 24 hours; they were mostly bought by speculators! Until a new supply was obtained newspapers were conveyed free, as before, but in March 190) a further 486,000 stamps arrived and in September 1901 488,000 more arrived: these lasted until 1908! Even to-day, over one a century later, mint blocks of these stamps are easy to find and are inexpensive.

With the disposal of the De La Rue archives, essays and proofs appeared in the market.
