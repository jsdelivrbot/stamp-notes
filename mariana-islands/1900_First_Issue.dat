The First Issue.
Shortly after Germany obtained possession
of the islands, a special set of
stamps was issued for their use, this
as in the case of other "first issues" of
German possessions â€”being made by
overprinting the 1889 series of the
Fatherland.

The overprint consists of
the name "Marianen" applied diagonally
upwards from left to right. There are
two varieties differing according to the
slope of the overprint. The first supply
sent out shows the name at a much
more acute angle than the later printings.
These are all quite scarce, with
the exception of the 30pf
