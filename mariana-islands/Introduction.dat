# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal history of the Mariana Islands

German stamps were first used in the German Mariana Islands on November 18, 1899 in the form of overprinted ("Marianen"). In May 1900 German provisionals with overprints were issued followed by the yacht issue in January 1901. 

The German post office closed with the Japanese occupation on October 14, 1914. Yacht stamps with lozenge watermarks were issed in Germany later for collectors.


The direct result of World War II on the Mariana Islands was that, after the war, the Northern Mariana Islands came under control of the United States in the same way they had earlier come under the control of Japan after World War I. However, this time they became part of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) established pursuant to Security Council Resolution 21. 

The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands later became a U.S. territory following its exit from the TTPI pursuant to Security Council Resolution 683. Although now both under U.S. control, the Northern Mariana Islands have not reunited with the territory of Guam, in part due to residual post-war tensions resulting from the very different histories of Guam (occupied by Japan for only 31 months, in wartime) and the Northern Mariana Islands (more peacefully occupied by Japan, for about 30 years). See the main articles above for discussion of present-day politics in these territorial areas.
