\chapter{1994 Nobel Brothers Petroleum Company} 

Incredible historical lessons are to be learned from studying stamps. When it comes to many aspects of early extraction and oil processing, Azerbaijan was among the first in the world. In 1919, it also was the first country to issue a petroleum-related stamp.

The Nobel Brother's Petroleum Stamp is the first petroleum-related stamp issued by Azerbaijan since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The stamps anticipated the signing of the Western Oil Consortium contract which was ratified in December 1994.

The Nobel Brothers established their company in 1879 and played a significant role in modernizing technology as it related to oil production in Azerbaijan in the 40 years that followed (see Azerbaijan International, Autumn 1994; 2:3).

For example, they initiated the use of a continuous distillation process in their refineries, a procedure which was not adopted in the United States until some 20 year later. They bought the first oil tanker for the Caspian in an effort to reduce transportation expenses. Within a short time the oil business began to boom in Baku, making it the busiest port in the world by 1890. The brothers also introduced diesel fuel as a source for heating their ships' engines and they designed railway tank cars, holding approximately 60 barrels each, to transport crude from the fields to the refineries. Later they went on to build the first pipeline in Azerbaijan.

When Robert Nobel purchased his first refinery in Baku, he acquired some land on the Cheleken Island off the coast of what now is Turkmenistan on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea due east of Baku. There, on that isolated island, Turkomans were involved in the exploitation and mining of ozocerite, a solid paste mixture of hydrocarbons (mainly paraffin) of dark-brown color which was sold and used as fuel, lubricant, and water proofing. The ozocerite was mined by hand by digging around in some of the active little mounds, known as "mud volcanoes" which were formed by oil and gas seepage. Turkmenistan's 1-Manat stamp shows one of those "mud volcanoes" (#8).

Since these "mud volcanoes" were familiar indications of the prolific oil fields in Baku, Robert decided to explore for oil on the Cheleken Island, too. In the early 1880s he drilled two wells but the results were poor, he soon gave up exploration. Several years later, however, Karl Vasiliyevich Hagelin, a manager of the Nobel Brothers Company, by chance learned about the wells and in 1901 organized an expedition to study their potential. As research could be carried out by geologists and engineers with a better understanding of the oil reservoirs and with more advanced drilling techniques, it wasn't surprising that oil was discovered on the island. Turkmenistan's 2-Manat stamp shows one of the first rigs used to explore the island (#9). 

Cheleken Island's crude oil was unusually rich in paraffin. Knowing that Russia was importing considerable quantities of paraffin, Hagelin decided to develop and produce this rare type of crude, and he installed the first paraffin refinery in Russia to process the crude. 

The 1.5 Manat stamp (#10) shows the ship, "Turkmen", the first of two diesel engine tugs ever built and used in oil transportation. The "Turkmen" and the "Sart" were used to pull barges up the Volga River. Both tugs used engines manufactured by another Nobel company in St. Petersburg.

The 3-Manat stamp (#11) depicts the three Nobel brothers and Peter Bilderling just as the Azerbaijani stamp does. The 5-Manat souvenir set shows the Company's 27th Anniversary Commemorative Medal depicting a cloister of early Baku oil well derricks along with Ludwig and Robert Nobel.
