# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Turkmenistan

The Republic of Turkmenistan, also known as Turkmenia is a country in Central Asia. Until 1991, it was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkmen SSR). It is bordered by Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the south and southwest, Uzbekistan to the east and northeast, Kazakhstan to the north and northwest and the Caspian Sea to the west.

\section{First Issue of Stamps}

The first stamps of Turkmenistan were issued on 26 April 1992.[1] Before then, Turkmenistan used stamps of the Soviet Union.

Overprints

Unlike other ex-Soviet republics, Turkmenistan did not overprint Soviet stamps to meet their postal needs after independence, although a number of overprints were carried out on Turkmenistan stamps in 1992 and 1993.[2]

Postal services

The Turkmenistan government exercises close control over postal communications. Parcels and letters are routinely opened by customs officials and delivery is unreliable. Businesses tend to use international couriers such as Federal Express and DHL, although in 2005 these firms were shut down by the government.[3]

\section{Illegal Stamps}
In 2000 Turkmenistan, as a member of the Universal Postal Union , UPU distributed through notice of the existence of counterfeit stamps  on the theme of "European Football Championship EURO-2000 " in denominations of 120.00 manat issued ostensibly on behalf of the State. You can use them as wall paper. 

Turkmenistan is a pretty 'closed' country, up there with North Korea and Bhutan 
in terms of ease of getting in and very little information seems to be available for its stamps.
