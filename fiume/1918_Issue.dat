December 2, 1918. The first Rijeka-stamp. The black hand-operated FIUME overprint on 
Hungarian 20 filler postage stamp of the 'harvesters' set. The overprint was proofed on 20 
filler stamp in Kirchhofer, the printing-house in Rijeka, in the 300 copy-print run. Although 
this suggestion of the overprint wasn't approved, a part of the stamps was sold in the postoffice of Rijeka, making the stamp the first stamp of Rijeka.
