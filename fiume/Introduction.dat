## Fiume

Fiume which is now called Rijeka (both words mean river) is a port on the East side of
the Northern Adriatic. Frequent changes of sovereignty make its postal history of exceptional interest. (The stamps now are mostly collected with [Croatia](../croatia/Introduction)).

In the middle of the fifteenth century it was bought by the Emperor Frederick III and was under Austrian rule. It was temporarily occupied by Venice during the war of League of Cambrai and possibly at other times. At the end of the second decade of the eighteenth century Charles V made it a free port. In 1776 Maria Theresa joined it to the Croatian Crownland, only to declare it three years later, after receiving complaints, a \textit{corpus separatum} of the Hungarian crown. The inhabitants of Fiume were hostile to the Croats and they helped maintain their independence by allyng themselves with their neighbour next but one. 

Between 1809 and 1813 the area was under Napoleon's control and became part of the Province of Illyria. In 1813 the English occupied the town. They left no trace of any mails.

The city was returned to Austria in 1814 and retored to Hungary in 1822, became part of the Croatian Crownland in 1848 and so remained until 1870 when it was given again t Hungary as an autonomous region.  From 1814 to 1870 despite changes in administration the postal regulations remained Austrian. When Austrian stamps were introduced in Austria in 1850, they were also used in Fiume. Hungarian stamps were not introduced until 1 May 1871 and their validity ceased after 31 July 1871. The enat Austrian postmarks provide an intereting chapter, as do letters with the Hungarian litho and recess issues of 1871. 

\subsection{The Hungarian Period}



\subsection{After the Great War}

After World War I, the city of Fiume was claimed by both the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Italy. On the eve of allied victory, on 28 October 1918, the Croats briefly occupied the city. However, on 30 October the inhabitants reacted and declared in plemiscite for annexation to Italy. On 17 November the Italians moved in and an allied headquarters was established in the city. Administration was put in the hands of a \textit{Consiglio Nationale}. The \textit{Consiglio} was authorised to issue stamps provided no political symbols were incorporated in the design (Dehn, 1990).


While its status was unresolved, its postal system was operated by a variety of occupation forces and local governments.

The first Italian postage stamps for Fiume were issued 2 December 1918. They were produced by overprinting "FIUME" on the contemporary stamps of Hungary. Both handstamping and printing presses were used. In January 1919, two postage due and a savings bank stamp were surcharged as well. These stamps even the most common values were extensively forged. Serious collectors will require close examination of all stamps.



January also saw the first appearance of an issue produced specifically for Fiume. It consisted of 17 values, ranging from 2 centesmi to 10 corona, and used four designs: a figure representing "Italy", the town clock tower with an Italian flag hanging from it, an allegory of "Revolution", and a sailor raising the Italian flag. The first printings were inscribed just "FIUME", while in July they were redesigned with the inscription "POSTA FIUME", along with other minor changes. Meanwhile, a set of 12 semi-postal stamps was issued 18 May, commemorating the 200th day of peace since the end of the war.
Later in 1919 the higher values were surcharged with lower values, and the semi-postals were overprinted "Valore globale" for use as regular stamps.

Gabriele d'Annunzio, 1920
On 12 September, 1920, the 1st anniversary of the city's takeover by the forces of Gabriele d'Annunzio, the city government issued a series of 14 values featuring a portrait bust of d'Annunzio, intended for regular use, and a set of four with various allegorical designs, intended for the use of the legionnaires on that day only.
On 18 November, the four commemoratives of 12 September were overprinted "ARBE" and "VEGLIA", marking the occupation of the islands of Arbe and Veglia, and on 20 November, more were overprinted "Reggenza / Italiana / del / Carnaro", and with new values.

In January 1921, Italian troops put an end to d'Annunzio's rule, and the subsequent provisional government overprinted the d'Annunzio heads with "Governo / Provvisorio".



On 24 April 1921, the 1st constituent assembly overprinted the semi-postals of 1919 with "24 - IV - 1921" and "Costituente Fiumana". 

The following year the 2nd assembly added a "1922" to the overprints.

On 23 March, 1923 a new issue put an end to the flurry of overprints. Its 12 values, inscribed "Posta di Fiume", used four designs, a Venetian sailing ship, a Roman arch, St. Vitus, and a rostral column, all printed over a buff-colored background. After the Treaty of Rome assigned Fiume to Italy (27 January), these stamps were overprinted "REGNO / D'ITALIA" (22 February) and then "ANNESSIONE / ALL'ITALIA" (1 March). Subsequently Fiume used the stamps of Italy.
