\chapter{Umm al Qwian}  

Umm al-Quwain  "Mother of the Two Powers" is one of the sovereign emirates in the United Arab Emirates, located in the north of the country. The emirate was ruled until his death by Rashid bin Ahmad Al Mu'alla, who was a member of the UAE's Supreme Council since 1981. The emirate had 62,000 inhabitants in 2003 (making it the least populous emirate in the federation) and has an area of 750 square kilometers. 

Accepted alternative spellings include Umm al Qiwain (used on its former postage stamps) as well as Umm al-Qawain, Umm al-Qaywayn, Umm el-Qiwain, Umm al-Qiwain and Umm al-Qaiwain.

\subsubsection{The ``un-adopted essays"}
In about 1994 the 5np, 10np, 15np and 20np stamps of British Postal Agencies in Arabia came on the market with alleged essays for a country overprint (modelled on Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar) for "Ajman", "Fujairah" (sic) and "Umm al Qaiwain" (sic).

From the GB overprints socitey: The font in no way matches that of the other Gulf overprints, does not match that of the currency overprint, and varies quite considerably in position relative to the currency overprint on different examples of the same overprint/value; It is doubtful if any professional printer would have produced such mongrel overprints, even as trial prints, nor could they have been legitimately produced without the involvement of the GPO. The overprints were prepared by a dealer/agent in 1963 who then tried to persuade the local governments to agree to issue them; they refused and the dealer/agent was left with a large stock of worthless items, subsequently inaccurately put on the market as "unadopted essays", which is, to say the least, grossly misleading. 

They cannot even be regarded as "forerunners" as they were no more than a private commercial speculation. They are bogus, and totally undeserving of the sort of prices asked by reputable dealers and auction houses

The modern history of Umm Al Quwain began some 200 years ago when the Al Ali tribe moved their capital from Al-Sinniyah Island to its present location in the mid-18th century due to declining water resources. In 1775, Sheikh Majid Al Mualla, founder of the ruling Al Mu primealla lineage of the Al Ali tribe, established an independent Sheikhdom in Umm al-Quwain.

On 8 January 1820, Sheikh Abdullah I signed the General Maritime Treaty with the United Kingdom, thus accepting a British protectorate in order to keep the Ottoman Turks out. Like Ajman, Dubai, Ras al-Khaimah and Sharjah, its position on the route to India made it important enough to be recognized as a salute state with a three gun salute.

On 2 December 1971, Sheikh Ahmad II joined its neighbors Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman and Fujairah in forming the United Arab Emirates, with Ras al-Khaimah joining later in early 1972.

Like Roman coins, stamps that were bought by collectors hardly diminish in numbers. A lot of the above are probably lost as ``personal mementos'' that are kept by people. Bogus or otherwise, they have a place in collections of the region.
