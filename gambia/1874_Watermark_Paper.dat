The introduction of watermarked paper for these stamps occurred in 1874, 
the paper being that familiar to collectors of British Colonial stamps as 
watermarked "Crown C.C." 

The paper was not readily adaptable for the small sheets of the Gambia stamps, 
and the method of cutting it to suitable sizes for these sheets has produced 
some varieties for the specialist.

Major Evans, writing in the Philatelic Record for January, 1883, says:

<blockquote>
"Most collectors are probably aware that the stamps of the British Colonies 
printed in England are, as a rule, in sheets of 240, divided into four panes 
of 60, each pane consisting of ten horizontal rows of six stamps. The Crown 
and C.C. watermarks are arranged in the same manner upon the sheet of paper; 
each pane is enclosed in a single-lined frame. Down the centre of the 
sheet is a blank space of about half an inch wide; across the centre is a wider 
space, watermarked with the words crown colonies, which are also repeated 
twice along each side of the sheet.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Some of my readers may have noticed that the watermark is 
not always very clearly shown in the Gambia stamps. This is 
due partly to the fact of their being embossed, and partly to [pg 21] 
their being arranged in small blocks of fifteen--three horizontal 
rows of five--so that a row of five stamps is printed on a row of 
six watermarks, and in most cases a complete watermark is not 
found on any one of the stamps in a block. Very frequently 
the upper and lower blocks on a sheet encroach on the margins, 
and consequently some of the stamps show portions of the words 
crown colonies in watermark; and I have seen a block which had 
been printed in the centre of one side of a sheet, and the middle 
row of which was watermarked colonies, while the upper and lower 
rows bore the Crown and C.C. Recent printings of some of the values 
of Gambia show the blocks printed sideways on the sheet, 
in which case each stamp will not show a complete watermark; 
and of these again I have seen a block with the vertical 
division of the sheet running across the central row." 
</blockquote>

In addition the stamps have been found with the watermark reversed, 
indicating that occasionally a sheet has been fed into the press the wrong side up. 
Inverted watermarks of this Crown and C.C. type are also to be found.

Of this issue, which comprises the same two values 4d. brown and 6d. blue, 
imperforate we get the following variations in the watermark

<h4>Crown CC Watermarks</h4>

}




Crown C.C. 	upright (Fig. A).
" 	inverted (Fig. C).
" 	reversed (Fig. B).


Portions of the words crown colonies.
Bars (i.e., division lines of the panes).

The gum shews the same variation - white and yellow - as in the 
original issue. The 4d. stamp varies in colour from deep brown 
to pale brown; the 6d. deep blue to blue, the solid colour in 
this case presenting a very mottled appearance.

Again, both values are known with the embossing doubly impressed.


Very few copies of the 4d. of this issue examined shew the spot 
on the hair, but in the sheet of the 6d. (plate I.) there are 
faint spots on stamps Nos. 1, 4, 5, 9, 12 and 13.

No. 11 on the same sheet shews the curl and sub-curl joined.

The date of issue of these watermarked stamps is uncertain, but 
the 6d. was chronicled in \textit{Le Timbre Poste} for December, 1874. 
The 4d. was not recorded in any of the contemporary magazines, 
and was probably not issued until some time after the higher denomination.

The watermark which is usually misplaced may be found inverted and reversed and also with portions
of the words __CROWN COLONIES__, and bars.

Specimens exist for both values. Thee is a recognised variety of the 6d., with sloping name tablet. Cover are worth a premium of four times
the stamps and blocks from 10.


The embossing of the 'cameo' stamps was  done subsequent to 
the printing and specimens are often found where the embossing 
does not register accurately with the printed design.
