\chapter{1869-72 Printer's Records}    

The negotiations began as early as April 13, 1868, when Penrose Julyan sent the following letter
to De La Rue.

The Government of Gambia are desirous of adopting Postage Stamps instead of money for the prepayment of letters to that Colony and have voted the sum of \pound100 for the dies and Plates necessary for printing stamps representing 4d. and 6d. (Easton p.276).

\section{Method of Printing and Embossing}

The first stage in printing the stamps was the formation of a steel die in \'empagn'e, that is with the printing surfcae raised). This was then used to prepare in reverse a master plate of fifteen impressions in a cement surfcae. Upon tthis cement plate was formed by electrolysis a copper printing surface. This was subsequently backed with lead to give it rigidity.

The use of only one die is indicated by the presence on most stamps, dependent upon inking, of a small but consident flaw.
