After the of the Cameo series, in 1898, The Gambia issued several sets of the usual keyplates: Victoria (one set, upper picture), Edward VII (three sets), George V (two sets, lower picture).

Some of the printing varieties, such as the "malformed S" on the QV set, and the "split A" on the first KGV set, are worth looking for, as are the two values overprinted in 1906 to fill a temporary shortage of ½d. and 1d. stamps.

The numbers printed are very small – of the KE VII 1/- and 2/- (first set) and the 4d., 6d. and 2/- (second set), fewer than 10 000 were printed, and many of those were destroyed.
