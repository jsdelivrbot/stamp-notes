##The Key Plate Issues
On the 31st January, 1898, the following notice was issued in
reference to the postage stamps of the Colony:--

\begin{quotation}
\begin{verbatim}

    "WITHDRAWAL OF PRESENT ISSUE OF GAMBIA POSTAGE STAMPS.

    "On the 1st May, 1898, the present issue, if not previously
    exhausted, of all denominations of Postage Stamps in the
    Gambia that are then in the hands of the Government will be
    destroyed, and a complete new set of stamps will then be put
    in circulation.

   "ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE,
    BATHURST, GAMBIA,
    31st January, 1898."
\end{verbatim}
\end{quotation}

Seven British Colonies, British Honduras, Cayman Islands, Gambia, St. Helena, Seychelles, Starits Settlements and Turks Islands - printed stamps from the De La Rue's
universal key plate inscribed postage/postage at either side. This plate was produced
from the first of the three colonial dies produced by De La Rue in 1890 for the Crown Agents and its customers to choose from - the other two dies were inscribed postage/reveune and revenue/revenue (this third die was not actually used). Each
colony that used the colonial keyplate then only needed to pay for the duty plate
that would contain the colony name and relevant value tablet.[1]

After the of the Cameo series, in 1898, The Gambia issued several sets of the usual keyplates: Victoria (one set, upper picture), Edward VII (three sets), George V (two sets, lower picture).

Some of the printing varieties, such as the "malformed S" on the QV set, and the "split A" on the first KGV set, are worth looking for, as are the two values overprinted in 1906 to fill a temporary shortage of \halfd. and 1d. stamps.

The numbers printed are very small of the KE VII 1/- and 2/- (first set) and the 4d., 6d. and 2/- (second set), fewer than 10 000 were printed, and many of those were destroyed.
