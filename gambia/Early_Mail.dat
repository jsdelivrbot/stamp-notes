\chapter{Early Mail}    
Postally there is little to record prior to 1866, which is the date ascribed by 
Mr. F. Bisset Archer, Treasurer and Postmaster-General, to an alteration in 
the scale of postage, the half ounce weight for letters being introduced. 
The rate to Great Britain was, we believe, from that date 6d. per half ounce.
