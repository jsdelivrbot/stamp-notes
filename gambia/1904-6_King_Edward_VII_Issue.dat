\section{Specimen Stamps}

\subsection{Receiving Authority Overprints}

Some Postal Authorities, when they had received a set of "specimens" from a UPU country,
they applied their own overprint or canceller to the postage stamps and many had these
affixed on special specimen books. Typical examples are the "ULTRAMAR" handstamp which 
was applied in Lisbon to UPU specimens supplied for the Portuguese colonies.

627 S 7 1/2 d. and 10d. each with dented frame and overprinted "SPECIMEN", no gum, 10d.
overprinted "SPECIMEN" with broken "M", mint; also 5d., 7 1/2d. and 10d. overprinted
"SPECIMEN" and each handstamped "ULTRAMAR", without gum and with some faults.
A scarce and unusual group of the new values \pound120-150.}

The French Colony of Gabon handstamped each specimen received, with a large double circle 
handstamp with the inscription "COLONIE
du GABON et du CONGO FRANCAIS/DIRECTION de L'INTERIEUR/1er/BUREAU". The Gabon U.P.U.
 archive which was
dispersed in c. 1975, and of which only a handful of each specimen exists, as it is to be expected.

628 S 7 1/2d. horizontal pair, 10d. vertical pair, 1/6d., 2/6d. horizontal pair and 3/-, each
handstamped "SPECIMEN" (12x11 1/2mm.) and with identifiable part strikes of the "COLONIE
du GABON et du CONGO FRANCAIS/DIRECTION de L'INTERIEUR/1er/BUREAU" double-ring
Receiving Authority handstamp, all without gum and the pairs rejoined; odd
imperfections though a remarkable group \pound500-600
Note: Marcus Samuel refers to these Specimen handstamps on page 58 of his handbook and
suggests that shortly after joining the U.P.U. in 1904 exchanged stamps with fellow members.
On receipt of these stamps Gabon applied their security handstamp.}
