The next and only remaining issue we have to describe are in the nature of Provisionals issued during a temporary shortage of halfpenny and penny stamps. The Bathurst correspondent of Ewen's Weekly Stamp News, writing April 30, 1906, communicated the following information, which is published in the issue of that journal for May 26, 1906:—

<blockquote>
"The surcharged penny and halfpenny postage stamps on the 3/- and 2/6 denominations respectively were issued on the [pg 54] 10th instant, and withdrawn on the 23rd April. The issue was necessary owing to a delay in receipt of a requisition for stamps sent to England on the 9th February, and by the abnormal sales, from some unknown reason, of the usual penny and halfpenny stamps during February and March.

"A very small issue was made pending the arrival of the mail on the 24th, by which the indent above mentioned was received. The total issue was 4500 penny and 3780 halfpenny." 
</blockquote>
The stamps overprinted to provide these emergency supplies were the 2s. 6d. purple and brown on yellow paper, which was overprinted for the halfpenny, and the 3s. carmine and green on yellow paper for the penny overprint.

The surcharging was effected in the Colony. In the case of the ½d. the overprint consists of the word
HALF
PENNY

in two lines of block capitals, and below this are two bars formed by ordinary printers' rules about 8½mm. long cancelling the figures denoting the original value of the stamp.

The type and rules were set up to overprint the stamps thirty at a time (5 horizontal rows of 6 stamps); thus the complete sheet of 120 stamps had to pass four times through the press. There is a slight variation in the distance between the bottom of the letters comprising the word penny and the uppermost bar, in the third and fourth rows of the setting. In rows 1, 2 and 5 the bar is 5mm. away from the bottom of the type; in rows 3 and 4 it is only 4mm. distant.

The first stamp in the second row of the setting is a variety in which the e of penny is broken and the word reads pfnny. The only other variety occurring in the setting is a slightly depressed y of penny. This occurs in the first stamp in the 5th row.

###The One Penny Overprint on 3s. Stamp

The 3s. stamp was overprinted with the words "one penny" in one line of small capitals. 
The overprint was applied to a complete pane of 60 stamps at a time, 
so that the entire sheet of 120 was surcharged at two impressions instead of four, 
as in the ½d. on 2s. 6d. stamp. 

The only varieties which have been recorded of this one penny overprint are of slight defects, 
possibly occurring only in particular impressions. It, however, exists with the overprint double.

The issue of these two Provisional overprints, following upon the appearance 
in 1905 of the 5d., 7½d. and 10d. stamps, brought a good deal of censure from philatelists, 
who considered that the Colony was descending to undignified means of 
increasing the revenue by the sale of stamps to collectors. 
At the instance of {{wi:Lord_Crewe}} an inquiry has lately been held into 
the reasons for the emission of various Colonial postage stamps, 
and the report of the Governor of the Gambia is quoted in the printed report of the Commission:—

<blockquote>
"The Governor of the Colony states that as the supply of the ½d. and 1d. 
stamps had been exhausted before the arrival of a new supply which had been ordered, 
no [regular] stamps of these denominations were available from the 2nd to the 10th April, 
letters requiring such postage being stamped 'Postage Paid.' The surcharged stamps were on sale from the 10th to the 24th of April, the date on which the new supply became available. A surplus was left over, which was destroyed with proper precautions." 
</blockquote>

The unsold balance of the Provisional ½d. stamps on hand was destroyed 
"under direction from the Secretary of State and by a special Board appointed by 
His Excellency the Acting Governor" on October 16, 1906. 
How small the "unsold balance" was is not stated.

###valuations

Varietites of broken __E__ in __HALF-PENNY__; and double surcharge are known.

Covers are worth a premium of about two and blocks 6N.

Records show that 3,780 1/2d., and 4500 1d.  of these provisional surcharges were made. the surcharge was effected by overprinting 30 (60x5) stamps
at a time. each sheet had to pass four times through the press. 3,00 of the 1/2 d. and 2,000 of the 1d. are
recorded as having been purchased.
These provisionals were on sale from April 10th to 24th, the unsold remainder being officially
destroyed on October 16th following.
