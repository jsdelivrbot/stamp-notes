##The Cameo stamps


The first Gambia stamps were issued in 1869. The Cameo head of Queen Victoria embossed in white on a  simple coloured ground was produced originally for reasons of cheapness,  but it comes high in philatelists charts of the best designs of all time.



There were four issues: 

\begin{decimal}
\item 1869, 4d and 6d values only, imperforate and unwatermarked; 
\item 1874,the same, on watermarked paper; 
\item 1880,seven values, perforated; and 
\item 1883-7 eight values, with changes of colour. 
\end{decimal}

The watermarks, first sideways then upright, and the perforations, first line then comb, give rise to a range of varieties, but the embossing gives an originality. The stamps normally passed twice through the plates, once for printing the colour, and a second time for the embossing. Where the two impressions don't quite coincide, the embossing is said to be displaced. And on rare occasions it was so displaced, indeed sometimes the wrong way up, that a third pass was necessary. These are known as doubly embossed and doubly embossed once inverted. Good examples are much sought after and expensive.

The numbers printed of the early issues are astonishingly small  fewer than 500 sheets, of fifteen stamps each, of the 1874 issue, for instance. A full discussion of the printing, perforating, and plating of the 'Cameos' with special reference to 1883-7 set can be found in an excellent book by Brian O'Hara:

The Cameos came to an end in 1898

The watermark which is usually misplaced may be found inverted and reversed and also with portions
of the words __CROWN COLONIES__, and bars.

Specimens exist for both values. Thee is a recognised variety of the 6d., with sloping name tablet. Cover are worth a premium of four times
the stamps and blocks from 10.


The embossing of the 'cameo' stamps was  done subsequent to 
the printing and specimens are often found where the embossing 
does not register accurately with the printed design.
