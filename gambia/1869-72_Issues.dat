\chapter{1869-72 Issues}  

The stamps were manufactured by Messrs. de la Rue \& Co. by a double process of 
flat printing and of relief embossing, the flat printing being doubtless effected first and 
the embossing afterwards. This combination was unusually effective, and the finished 
stamps rank among the handsomest adhesive postage stamps known to collectors.

As embossing evenly over a large area presented considerable difficulties, the plates 
were made up of fifteen stamps only, in three horizontal rows of five stamps. 
The plates for both processes evidently fitted each other with precision, though 
in the printing occasionally the embossing is slightly out of register.

The paper is white wove and has no watermark, and the stamps were not perforated. There are two colours of the gum, one being the usual clear white: the other is a pale yellow colour, which may, however, be due to climatic influence, particularly as it is a noticeable feature of a number of the later issues.
