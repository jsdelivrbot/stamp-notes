In 1922 the colony launched its own series, the semi-pictorial Elephant-and-Palm set (upper picture), based on the West African coat-of-arms. This set was commissioned in 1921, but several reasons caused delays in the final contracts: the unusual formats of both pence and shilling values, loss of the metal despatch boxes, a financial crisis in The Gambia. The various values were only sent out throughout June, July, and August 1922, and issued on 1 September.

There are two watermarks: 4d., 7\halfd., 1/-, and 5/- with Multiple CA, and all values with Multiple Script CA. And there are several perforations: 14 line, 13 3/4 line, and 14 x 13\frac13 comb for the pence values; 14 line, 13 3/4 comb, 14 x 13 3/4 line, and 13 3/4 x 14 line for the shilling values.

The small numbers ordered and the unusual formats must have given De La Rue a real headache! Some are known to be rare : the 3/- slate-purple comb is the accepted rarity of the set, though just expensive, not hard to find. But keep your eyes open for the 2/- indigo on bright blue paper, 13 3/4 comb, and the 4d. 14 x 13 3/4 comb with Script watermark. And there are others. For details of the different consignments sent between 1922 and 1938, consult \textit{The Stamps and Postal History of The Gambia} published by Christies Robson Lowe in conjunction 
with the West Africa Study Circle. 

Matching the shades to the consignments is for advanced students only.
