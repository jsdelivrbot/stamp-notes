##Pigeon Post
By order of Nov. 10, 1870, dispatch-reply cards were distributed by Parisian post offices for citizens to include with their letters that were carried by balloon. The senders had to affix 5c in postage to the front and 1fr in postage to the reverse, and fully complete the eight columns -- addressee, sender, and yes or no answers to four questions. The recipient was then supposed to write their response to the sender on the reverse and deliver it to a post-office. The cards were then supposed to be sent for processing at Clermont-Ferrand, but were probably processed elsewhere. Their messages were transcribed and microphotographed and sent to Paris by carrier pigeon, and the cards allegedly destroyed.

Their messages were transcribed and microphotographed and sent to Paris by carrier pigeon, and the cards allegedly
destroyed. This card, however, was not deliverable, and remained in the French "dead letter office" until August 30, 1873 when it was returned to the sender in Paris. It may be unique.

__The pigeon service officially ended on Feb. 1, 1871, 
although, as it is evident from the Pigeon Dispatch Reply Card shown on the right, it appears 
that messages continued to be transcribed and forwarded by the pigeon mail system to clear the backlog.__

__The Pigeon Mail Post of this period of French History, together with the Baloon flights form one of the most interesting
parts of French Postal History. Material is scarce to come by and when it does,
it does get snapped by collectors very quickly.__
