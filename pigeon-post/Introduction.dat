Official Handwritten Communication. From Director of Telegraphs and Posts F.F. Steenackers to Engineering Director of Telegraphic Service Mercadier, on 69 x 45mm blue flimsy with usual small handwriting, tiny adherence on back at top right, usual folds and tiny paper breaks associated with rolling into a tube and strapping onto a pigeon

VERY FINE. AN EXTREMELY RARE OFFICIAL HANDWRITTEN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TWO MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH POSTAL SERVICE.

The letter is written in a combination of letters and code.

For the first month after the siege of Paris began, small handwritten messages carried by pigeons were the only means of communicating with Paris. It was very inefficient because the messages had to be transcribed in very small handwriting so the pigeons could carry them. The Germans often shot down the pigeons so that the message failed to reach Paris. To compensate, the French first began sending multiple copies of the same message with different pigeons. But the problems of having to produce multiple copies by hand in such small writing with one message per flimsy, coupled with the public's demand to communicate with the Parisians forced the French to find ways to increase the quantity of messages sent to Paris. Subsequent lots illustrate the more efficient means of transmitting news and messages by pigeons.

Pigeon post is the use of homing pigeons to carry messages. As a method of communication, it is likely as old as the ancient Persians from whom the art of training the birds probably came. The Romans used pigeon messengers to aid their military over 2000 years ago. Frontinus said that Julius Caesar used pigeons as messengers in his conquest of Gaul.[1] The Greeks conveyed the names of the victors at the Olympic Games to their various cities by this means.[2]

Before the telegraph this method of communication had a considerable vogue amongst stockbrokers and financiers. The Dutch government established a civil and military system in Java and Sumatra early in the 19th century, the birds being obtained from Baghdad. In 1851, the German-born Paul Julius Reuter opened an office in the City of London which transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris via the new Calais to Dover cable. Reuter had previously used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, a service that operated for a year until a gap in the telegraph link was closed.[3]

Details of the employment of pigeons during the siege of Paris in 1870-71 led to a revival in the training of pigeons for military purposes. Numerous societies were established for keeping pigeons of this class in all important European countries; and, in time, various governments established systems of communication for military purposes by pigeon post. After pigeon post between military fortresses had been thoroughly tested, attention was turned to its use for naval purposes, to send messages to ships in nearby waters. It was also used by news agencies and private individuals at various times. Governments in several countries established lofts of their own. Laws were passed making the destruction of such pigeons a serious offense; premiums to stimulate efficiency were offered to private societies, and rewards given for destruction of birds of prey. Before the advent of radio, pigeons were used by newspapers to report yacht races, and some yachts were actually fitted with lofts.

During the establishment of formal pigeon post services, the registration of all birds was introduced. At the same time, in order to hinder the efficiency of the systems of foreign countries, difficulties were placed in the way of the importation of their birds for training, and in a few cases falcons were specially trained to interrupt the service war-time, the Germans having set the example by employing hawks against the Paris pigeons in 1870-71. No satisfactory method of protecting the weaker birds seems to have been developed, though the Chinese formerly provided their pigeons with whistles and bells to scare away birds of prey. However, as radio telegraphy and telephony were developed, the use of pigeons became limited to fortress warfare as early as in the 1910s. As an example, the British Admiralty discontinued its pigeon service in the early 20th century, although it had attained a remarkably high standard of efficiency. Nevertheless, large numbers of birds were still kept at the great inland fortresses of France, Germany and Russia at the outbreak of the First World War.

In modern days, rafting photographers still use pigeons as a sneakernet to transport digital photos on flash media from the camera to the tour operator.[4]
