Pigeon Dispatch Reply Card. Front with usual 5c Green (23, Yvert No. 20) tied by "Cloyes S. Le Loir Dec. 15 1870" double circle datestamp, reverse with 20c Blue and 80c Carmine (33 and 36, Yvert Nos. 29 and 32) with blue ms. and tied by blue 30 Aut. 1873 double-circle datestamps, card with printed text instructing recipient to complete eight columns with the first four relating to the sender and the recipient and the last four yes or no

Their messages were transcribed and microphotographed and sent to Paris by carrier pigeon, and the cards allegedly
destroyed. This card, however, was not deliverable, and remained in the French "dead letter office" until August 30, 1873 when it was returned to the sender in Paris. It may be unique.

Illustrated in Bofarull (p.38). Signed Bolaffi. With 1990 Bolaffi certificate (Image)
	E. 15,000-20,000

__The pigeon service officially ended on Feb. 1, 1871, 
although, as it is evident from the Pigeon Dispatch Reply Card shown on the right, it appears 
that messages continued to be transcribed and forwarded by the pigeon mail system to clear the backlog.__

__The Pigeon Mail Post of this period of French History, together with the Baloon flights form one of the most interesting
parts of French Postal History. Material is scarce to come by and when it does,
it does get snapped by collectors very quickly.__
