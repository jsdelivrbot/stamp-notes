Photo-Micrography Carried by Pigeon into Paris. Six pages of typed text on one 21 x 23mm piece of ultra-thin paper, each page with Dagron & Co. handstamp and "Depeches per Pigeons", faults incl. large pieces out of two pages (to be expected from this extremely fragile paper)

FINE. A WONDERFUL POSTAL ARTIFACT OF THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.

Dagron, a Parisian resident, found a means of reducing the size of the dispatches further to enable the pigeons to carry more information per trip. He left Paris on Nov. 12 in the Balloon "Niepce" that was shot at by the Prussians. When his balloon finally landed, he and his fellow passengers evaded pursuing Prussian soldiers on foot. Dagron arrived at Tours on Nov. 21 and began work immediately.

###How Messages were Received and Transcribed
When messages were received, they were projected onto a 
screen and transcribed by hand onto these forms 
and forwarded to the intended recipient. You can see an example below. The message is short 
due to the high cost of messages and was sent nine weeks after receipt 
due to the large quantity of messages sent by pigeons.
