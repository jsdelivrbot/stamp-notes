# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Hamburg

This article is about the postage stamps and postal history of Hamburg from the medieval messengers until the entry of the Hamburg Postal Administration into the Northern German Postal District in 1868.


\subsection{Postage stamps of the Hamburg City Post}

The first postage stamps of the Hamburg City Post Office were introduced on 1 January 1859. They were rectangular and in the middle was the coat of arms of the city, overlaid with the value number. Below that is the word Postmarke (postage stamp), above it is Hamburg. Value and currency (Schilling) are imprinted as text at the borders. Values of \half, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 Schillinge were issued.

On all the stamps engraved
by Ziesenist there are so-called "secret
marks." As these are of considerable
value in distinguishing originals from
the many forgeries that exist, we give a
list of these as follows:

\half. schilling. There is a small dash in
the space between the base of the right
hand tower and the line above "Schilling."

In 1864, the supplemental values 1.25 and 2.5 Schillinge with a different frame design were issued. These early issues were already gummed but still imperforated. The following nine values, issued in 1864 and 1867 and again with the design of the first issues, finally had perforations. I

In 1866, another two values with a different octagonal frame design were issued; and on 5 May 1867, another one with the design of the first stamps. Hamburg's stamps were only valid until the end of 1867, since as of 1 January 1868, only the stamps of the North German Postal District were valid.


\subsection{Stamps of the Institute of Hamburg's Messengers}
The Institute of Hamburg's Messengers issued a stamp with the value of \half Schilling. The private company delivered only letters and newspapers within the city of Hamburg and charged half a Schilling. The stamps were printed in black on coloured paper.
