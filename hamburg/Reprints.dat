\section{The Unofficial Reprints.}

In 1868, shortly after the stamps
were replaced by the issue for the North
German Confederation, the remainders
were offered for sale and found a purchaser
in the late Mr. J. Goldner, a
well-known stamp dealer of Hamburg.

How many stamps were included in this
lot is a matter regarding which no information
has been published that we
know of. It would appear that these
remainders were all specially printed
for sale if we can place any reliance on
a statement that when the stamps were
demonetised "only one sheet of the 154
and 2*/2 schilling remained over, some
imperforate sheets of the second issue
of the 1^4 schilling, and some defective
sheets." If this were the case then the
fact that the remainders had no gum
is easily accounted for.

Having very few of the lithographed
V/4 and 2^sch Mr. Goldner approached
the lithographer, Mr. C. Adler, and finding the original drawings
were available commissioned him
to make new stones of these values.

Though the design was the same as the
originals the stones were laid down in
a different fashion. 

For the lJ4sch a
block of sixteen transfers was made (in
four rows of four) and this was retransferred
to the stone six times making
sheets of 96 stamps.1 These types
all show little peculiarities differing
from the issued stamps, these being detailed
in full in Mr. Brunei's article in
the "Postage Stamp," already alluded
to. The "plate" for the 2^sch also
consisted of 96 stamps but in this instance
the transfers were applied in
blocks of four.

These reprints appear to have been
made in 1872. At first unwatermarked
paper was used and then a quantity of
the original watermarked paper being
discovered this was used. These "reiprints"
are known imperforate, perf.
ll l
/2, and perf. 13^. 

Those on unwatermarked
paper or perf. 11^ can easily
be distinguished for there were no
originals of this sort; and those on
watermarked paper, perf. 13^, may be
told by the roughness of the perforations
compared with the originals.
Though the official perforating machines
were used the pins had become
worn causing the "rough" effect.

About the same period reprints, or
rather imitations, of the 1J4 and l^sch
stamps of 1866 were made. These were
printed on white wove unwatermarked
paper and are found rouletted 8J^ as
well as the 10 of the originals. The
"reprint" of the l%sch is from a retouched
die and it differs from the
originals in having the small circles in
the center of the four rosettes, which
separate the inscriptions, filled in with
color. There is also no line in the upper
part of the "g" of "Schilling." 

The
l^sch was reprinted from the envelope
die, and has a longer line in the upper
part of the "g" of "Schilling," while the
corner stars also have solid centers.
The paper is thicker and the color of
the impression does not show through
as in the case of the originals. Both
"reprints" exist with forged postmarks.

\subsection{Concluding Notes}

The few reprints, as we have already
pointed out, were made privately some
years after the stamps had become obsolete,
and these should present no difficulties
to the collector. 


\subsection{Forgeries}
Forgeries of
most of the values are very common,
but as most of these are very roughly
executed they should hardly deceive the
collector exercising ordinary care.
