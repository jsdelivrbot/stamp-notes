## Ecuador

{{wi:Ecuador}} is located on the west coast of South America, straddling the equator from
which it takes its name. It has roughly a population of eleven million persons, of which
perhaps ninety percent are indigenous. It has three zones geographically speaking: the coastal
plain, rich in agricultural potential, the Cordillera or Andes mountain region, high and
barren and cold, and the rain forest which borders on the Amazon river tributaries to the
east. 

The country was alternately a part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru and then of {{wi:New_Granada}}. After one abortive attempt at independence from Spain in 1805, ruthlessly
crushed by the Spaniards, it remained for General Jose Antonio de Sucre to captain its
independence in 1822. For the next eight years Ecuador was a part of Gran Colombia,
which at that time included [Colombia](../colombia/introduction  "Introduction to Colombian Philately") and Venezuela. Ecuador obtained its sole independence
in 1830. 

From then to now Ecuador has had a succession of non-constitutional
changes of government, some fifty in all. Principally the struggle was between conservative {[wi:Quito}} and liberal {{wi:Guayaquil}}.

Philatelically speaking, the mails have been carried in Ecuador since earliest times; to
Spain and the Indies by boat, and over the Inca highway from Lima, Peru, to Quito.
My earliest stampless cover is dated 1674. Stampless covers are known from twenty-four
different Ecuadorean towns. I am showing in the frames some stampless covers from 1790
to about 1860, from twenty-two of these towns.

I am also showing in the frames some covers from the British Post Office at Guayaquil,
which operated from 1849 to 1880. These were carried twice monthly to Lima and to Panama
for onward transmission. In addition to the 'C-41' killer, five datestamps are known
(Fig No 1). Even more difficult to find are the covers used from the French Post Office
in Guayaquil, which existed from 1872 to 1874. In twenty years of collecting Ecuadorean
stamps, I have only seen two of these covers; the album page I am passing round illustrates
only a stamp on piece with the appropriate datestamp. Completing the survey of inter-

The country also includes the Gal\apagos Islands in the Pacific, about 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) west of the mainland.


First stamps

The first stamps of Ecuador were issued on 1 January 1865.[1]

prominent flaws of the plate, and, which is of great significance, embossed Ecuadorian coat of arms,

and backstamped on receipt. The majority of maritime mail to Peru before autumn 1866 was carried 
through the British P.O. at Guayaquil, without involvement of the Ecuadorian mails, this postal history 
example being one of the exemptions in this period not carried through the British P.O., as well as 
one of the earliest usages to a foreign destination. Moreover, the most important feature in this item is 
the extremely rare usage of this stamp with embossed coat of arms on external correspondence.

national mail'from Ecuador before it joined the UPU in 1880, an American consul, among
other private forwarders of the mail, had his own postmark. An example of such a cover,
used in 1836, is shown in the frames.

The first stamp issue of Ecuador was conceived in November of 1864, and was issued
on 1 January 1865. Due to the relative profusion of these stamps, it is still possible to
put together a creditable first issue study. For example, there are sheets of the Medio
Real, blue and Un Real, yellow, on the market. The Un Real, green, is not known to exist
in larger than a pane of six. The Cuatro Reales, red, is also of interest. Somewhere in the world is a full sheet, and I am passing round a photographic reproduction of it. I have never been able to track down the ownership of this sheet.

Of perhaps equal interest, however, is considering the reprints of the first issue. My
frames show such a study. As indicated there, the sister and brother who respectively
engraved and printed the first issue, engraved and printed new dies to comingle with the
old, producing in 1890 and in 1893 a whole new family of 'stamps' (Fig No 2). These
later plates were reprinted in Spain in 1926. No reprints were made in Germany or elsewhere, as the philatelic literature would have us believe. This brother and sister also came up with some beautiful facsimilies and essays of the Cuatro Reales, red, which I am also showing in the frames (Fig No 3).

The Ecuadoreans are great stamp collectors. As early as 1897 they organised their first
stamp club. I am privileged to pass round for your examination a copy of the first issue of
their stamp journal. This, incidentally, was only one year after the formation in the United
States of the prestigious New York Collectors Club. Also of interest is an 1898 postal card,
which I will pass round, which was an invitation for the first stamp exhibition held that
year in Ecuador. Currently a number of active stamp clubs exist there, and I have here, if
anybody is interested, some examples of their stamp journals.

I note in a fairly recent issue of THE LONDON PHILATELIST* a study of philately in the
Galapagos Islands, which has been a possession of Ecuador since 1837. In the frames I
have some material on the subject. Of particular interest is the 'Post Office Barrel' which
has been in continuous use by passing whalers, scientific expeditions, and now tourists,
from the late 1700s to the present. The barrel actually exists and is still used.

Finally, in the frames I am showing some airmail stamps and covers, used from 1920 to
1930. Included here are most of the SCADTA first flights. SCADTA was the German
owned airline headquartered in Colombia, which was given an airmail concession from
Ecuador in 1928. I might also mention the interesting 'Cts' error. The provisional 1928
SCADTA airmail issue for Ecuador was prepared in Guayaquil by overprinting stamps
of the 1923 Colombian SCADTA definitive issue, as will be seen from the page I am
passing round. At the base of each of these stamps is the value line, including the word
'Centavos'. In preparing the type for the overprint, the printer added the abbreviation
'Cts' where the stamps were revalued, so that one sheet read at the base '50 Cts 50'. Of
course the underlying word 'centavos' was already there, so all further sheets were printed
with the abbreviation 'Cts' deleted. From this one erroneous sheet eighty-two stamps were
sold to the public, and were postally used on the first day of issue, 28 August 1928. The
remainder were destroyed. I am passing round a cover showing this error (illustration
no 4). As far as we can now determine, the mint '50 Cts 50' stamps found from time to
time in the expensive auction sales, and all of the 75 Centavos stamps with a like error,
were 'manufactured' at a later date.

Turning now to the main subject of my remarks, the Seebeck issues of Ecuador. I am
sure that many of you are familiar with the terms of the so-called Seebeck contract. This
provided that the printer (the Hamilton Bank Note Company of New York) would supply
to the post office concerned, at no cost, its total needs in stamps and postal stationery.

In return, the stamps were to be demonitised at the end of each year, and the remainders
returned to the company. In addition to resale of the remainders, the company had the
right to make reprints from the original plates to supply the needs of stamp dealers and
collectors. This contract covered Ecuador's stamp production from 1890 through 1896.
Much has been made in the philatelic press about the supposed blight which this type of
arrangement placed on philately. I would call to your attention in this regard an interesting exchange of correspondence, in August 1893:

\begin{blockquote}[shadow]

\opening{N. F. Seebeck, Esq,}
\opening{New York City.}
\opening{Dear Sirs,}

Ever since the stamps known as the "Seebeck Issues," which you provided for
several of the Central American countries, and for Ecuador, have been current,
considerable opposition on the part of philatelists and the magazines claiming to
represent their interests has manifested itself in relation to them. In no instance do
we see an article written in their defence, as being philatelically desirable.
Deeming you to be the best authority and one most capable of producing an argument
in their favour we would esteem it a great favour if you would write an article
on the subject for our paper, Filatelic Facts and Fallacies.

\closing{Very Truly Yours,}
\closing{W. Sellschopp & Co}

\end{blockquote}

In reply came the following letter:

\begin{blockquote}

\opening{Messrs Wm Sellschopp & Co,}
\opening{San Francisco}
\opening{Gentlemen,}

I have duly received your letter of the 17th, and thanking you for the courtesy
extended, I am afraid that for several reasons I cannot avail myself of your offer to
write an article in "defence" of my issues; there is nothing to defend. My contracts
with the different governments are so plain and open and known to nearly all stamp
collectors that there is little or nothing I could add. Whoever does not like to invest
in my stamps I do not want to convince to buy through any article I may write or
inspire. Again thanking you for your courtesy, I remain,

\closing{Truly yours,}
\closing{N. F. Seebeck}

\end{blockquote}

Many a philatelist  found the reprints as eminently collectable as the originals. However, a number of stamp collectors and dealers remain confused as to what they are all about. May I quote from a recent English stamp auction catalogue:


As will be seen, all new stamps issued by Ecuador from 1892 through 1896 are those
printed by the Hamilton Bank Note Company pursuant to the Seebeck contract, and all
reprints were prepared in a like manner.

In the frames I show the Seebeck issues of 1892, 1895 and 1896, including postage,
official and telegraph stamps. Not shown due to limitations on space are the various postal stationery. 

No 1893 postal issue was provided by Seebeck, and he thereby broke the
contract. Ecuador on its part also broke the contract by keeping all of its remainders.
These were later issued with provisional overprints in the period 1896 through 1898.
I will pass round the only known proof of the 1893 postal issue, in the form of an
advertisement by the Hamilton Bank Note Company. Interestingly enough, Seebeck also
printed advertisements on the back of his reprints before selling them to dealers and
collectors (Fig No 5). I am passing round an example of this.
Covers show a profusion of Seebecks (Fig Nos 6 and 7).

I have picked the 1894 issue to explore in a little further detail the genuine stamps as
opposed to the reprints. There were, first of all, two printings of the original stamps. 1 will pass round a page showing quite clearly the colour differences in the two printings. For convenience and for later comparison you will note I have labeled these printings as 'P-l' and 'P-2'.

The thickness of the paper used, the direction of the paper weave, and the existence of a
watermark or not, enable us to distinguish clearly between the original stamps and the
reprints of the 1894, 1895, and 1896 issues. I am passing round pages which differentiate
between the reprints of these issues (denominated as 'R-l' through 'R-4') and the original
stamps (denominated as 'P-F through 'P-4'). I am indebted to my friend Dr John W.
Funkhouser, whose article in the November 1960 issue of the Collectors Club Philatelist
assisted in establishing the system of classifications used here. Finally, I am passing round examples of each stamp of the 1894 issue, both of reprint and original, for every
denomination.

There is one further device which assists differentiation between the original and reprint
stamps when the 1894 official issue is considered. For these stamps the plates for each
denomination of postage stamp were printed in black, and upon which the 'Franqueo
Oficial' overprint was placed. Use of ultra-violet or black light will, in addition to the other tests previously mentioned, allow the reprint to be easily distinguished from the original.

I mentioned earlier that Ecuador broke its contract with Seebeck by keeping the remainders
and overprinting them, during the term of the existing contract, for its postal needs.
I am passing round examples of this overprinting, accomplished during 1893, 1895 and
1896 (Fig No 8).
