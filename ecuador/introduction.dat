\ph[80%]{../ecuador/514.jpg}{514 1865-73, 1r. dark green, fine impression, pair graced by large to huge margins showing portion of 
adjacent adhesive at left, positions 89-90, the latter from the bottom right corner of the sheet featuring colourless spot in bottom right spandrel and broken frame line at right being two of the most 
prominent flaws of the plate, and, which is of great significance, embossed Ecuadorian coat of arms, 
used on single weight entire letter from Guayaquil to Lima (Peru), dated 18 March 1866, tied by cds 
and backstamped on receipt. The majority of maritime mail to Peru before autumn 1866 was carried 
through the British P.O. at Guayaquil, without involvement of the Ecuadorian mails, this postal history 
example being one of the exemptions in this period not carried through the British P.O., as well as 
one of the earliest usages to a foreign destination. Moreover, the most important feature in this item is 
the extremely rare usage of this stamp with embossed coat of arms on external correspondence.
