###The Embossed Stamps

\lettrine{T}{he first stamps of Natal} were embosed in relief on plain coloured paper. They were executed at the 
Natal treasury by May and Davis, Pietermaritzburg from dies made by William Wyon in London. The Colony's first postage stamps were a makeshift issue introduced as a result of complaints from the public. 

There were four values, namely, 3d., 6d., 9d. and 1/-, crudely produced from the embossing dies of those values which were used at the Natal Treasury for the purpose of stamping documents subject to stamp duty. For such purposes, a series of embossing dies ranging from 3d. to &pound;25 was in use for impressing on documents such as licences, title deeds, etc. which attracted duty in terms of Ordinance No. 3 of 1850. The dies were normally impressed directly on to the document which required stamping, but for the production of postage stamps the dies were impressed, one impression at a time, on small sheets of rather coarse coloured wove paper, probably ready-gummed, obtained from a local stationer.

No means of perforating the stamps was available, so they had to be cut from the sheet with scissors as they were sold. The 3d. stamp was impressed on a rose coloured paper, the 6d. on green, the 9d. on blue and the 1/-on buff paper. In every case the colouring went through the paper. Each value was of a different design, but basically all the designs consisted of the word 'Natal' at the top, then a crown between the letters
V.R. (Victoria Regina), and below that the value in words. All this was surrounded, or partially surrounded, by a frame the style of which was different for each value. The dies, or at any rate those used for the production of the postage stamps, were made by B. Wyon of London.

A 1d. value was added to the series early in 1858, the die for this stamp being somewhat smaller than the other dies and not containing the letters V.R.; the style of lettering was also different. It is not known where this die came from, but it was certainly not as well executed as the other dies. At the outset the 1d. die was impressed on blue paper, but later rose paper was used and then buff, presumably to use up stocks of paper left over from the other stamps.

More than one reprint was made. They can be distinguished by the brighter colours and clearer embossing than that of the 
original and slightly glazed paper.

All of the 1857 Natal Embossed values are scarce or rare, but when they 
do make their infrequent appearance of the market they are invariable 
in used condition. Only a tiny number of unused or mint copies have ever 
been certified and nearly all of those have been the Three Pence value. 
The stamp has a long storied history. It was first declared genuine in 
1956 by Robson Lowe, who signed the accompanying BPA certificate at that time. 
Since then it has graced some of the most important British Commonwealth 
collections ever assembled. It remains unpriced in both Scott and Stanley 
Gibbons, due to its infrequent appearance at public auction.

An important rarity of the British Commonwealth, or the whole world 
for that matter. Accompanied by 1956 BPA, 1973 Alberto Diena and 
2007 Brandon certificates; ex-Bowlby, "Midas", Melat and "Samos". (S.G. #6). 

The stamp re-appeared in the market in March 2012 at the Spinks Shreeves Collector's 
auction at an estimate of Est. $40,000-50,000 and realizing $55,000.00

The method of producing the stamps was obviously quite unsuitable, especially as the embossing machine was apparently so constructed that it could emboss only two rows of stamps on the sheet, which then had to be turned round to take two rows on the opposite side. It seems unlikely that the Treasury would have been willing to relinquish control of the dies, so the production of the stamps must have been carried out at the Treasury itself. The appearance of the stamps was poor and, having to be cut from the sheet with scissors as they were sold, their size varied greatly. 

In a letter written to the Colonial authorities in London on 6 July 1859, the Governor described the stamps as 'a clumsy substitute for the usual postage stamps and prepared with difficulty', and asked that the new stamps which had been ordered on 6 September 1858 should be despatched as early as possible. 

Actually, the new stamps, of the value of 3d., and supplied by Perkins Bacon & Co. of London, were already on their way to Natal and must have arrived soon after the letter had been written. New 1d. stamps arrived early in 1860, but new 6d. stamps were not received until 1863 -this notwithstanding the fact that the 6d., 9d. and 1/-embossed stamps had been withdrawn, along with the embossed 3d. value, in July 1859.
