###The Embossed Stamps

\lettrine{T}{he first stamps of Natal} were embosed in relief on plain coloured paper. They were executed at the 
Natal treasury by May and Davis, Pietermaritzburg from dies made by William Wyon in London. The Colony's first postage stamps were a makeshift issue introduced as a result of complaints from the public. 

The stamps were issued on June 1st, 1857, as may be seen from the Government notice which reads:

\begin{blockquote}
On and after the 1st proximo (1st June, 1857), stamps on coloured paper,
respectively of the value of threepence, sixpence, ninepence and one shilling, to
be used in the prepayment of letters, may be procured at the Post Offices of
Pietermaritzburg and Durban. These stamps will also be issued as soon as
practicable at the various branch Post Offices throughout the Colony
\end{blockquote}


There were four values, namely, 3d., 6d., 9d. and 1/-, crudely produced from the embossing dies of those values which were used at the Natal Treasury for the purpose of stamping documents subject to stamp duty. For such purposes, a series of embossing dies ranging from 3d. to &pound;25 was in use for impressing on documents such as licences, title deeds, etc. which attracted duty in terms of Ordinance No. 3 of 1850. The dies were normally impressed directly on to the document which required stamping, but for the production of postage stamps the dies were impressed, one impression at a time, on small sheets of rather coarse coloured wove paper, probably ready-gummed, obtained from a local stationer. 

As previously stated, the dies of the fiscal stamps were used for embossing
the stamps of this issue. These dies were used for embossing the duty on documents
and from 1856 to 1884 for embossing on white cream or bluish laid paper
adhesive stamps for fiscal purposes. The id., 3d., 6d., 9d., 1/-, 1/6, and 2/6
dies were also used for the fiscal stamps of 1869 which were embossed on surface
coloured paper and perforated 12 1/2. The method of production of the postage
stamps must have been extremely cumbersome, whether they were embossed
by means of a hand-press or stamped singly. The differences in spacing, both
vertical and horizontal, between individual stamps are incongruously extreme, so
much so that the second alternative is by no means out of the question. If this
was really the course adopted, the \tete, or more correctly tete-a-tete varieties
of the 3d. stamp are easily understandable.

It is possible that a hand-press was utilized and as Mann writes: 'it would be interesting to conjecture on the number of stamps embossed on a sheet'. There is, however, little possibility of
arriving at any conclusion in this respect. Pairs are scarce. A block of 4 of the
i /- value is in existence as well as a single copy of this value which shows impressions
on its face of the neighbouring stamps both above and below. There were
thus at least three horizontal rows. The hand-press, if used, was not likely to be
large, no doubt, too, the paper sheet would have been considerably larger than the
press, so that in the process of embossing, the sheet of paper would probably be
turned round in the press and the tete-a-tete varieties caused by this procedure

Large quantities of stamps were, however, probably not required, as it should
be borne in mind that the white population of Natal in 1857 must have been
extremely small. So late as 1876 the total population is given as 326,957, of which
only 20,490 were whites, and this, too, was after the sugar industry had been
established, necessitating the indenturing of East fndian labour which was
probably mostly illiterate. Possibly, for this reason, when stamps were ordered
from London it was considered sufficient to requisition for a 3d. value only,
although it must have been fairly obvious that a id. stamp was also necessary.
There would have been no great hardship in tearing off a strip of 3 or 4 from a
sheet of perforated stamps to make up excess postage, but it was quite a different
proposition to use three or four embossed 3d. stamps, the production of which
was so much more laborious.

The higher value stamps, therefore, were no doubt issued in the embossed
series to save both trouble and inconvenience.

The stamps themselves have never really been popular. In the first place they
are not beautiful or even striking; in the early days they were often discarded
as being fiscals. Then the difficulty—which still remains—of distinguishing
originals from the reprints, which were produced at the Post Office at various dates
up to 1884, has naturally prejudiced the ordinary collector. There is, however,
no doubt that intrinsically these stamps should be regarded as some of the really
few "Primitives," and could be classed with the Hawaiian Missionaries or British
Guiana Circulars without any injustice to either of these two issues.

In the RPS's work it is stated that these stamps were "said to have been
printed for the Government by Messrs. P. Davis & Son of Pietermaritzburg."
Mr. A. E. Basden of Pretoria provides some information in this connection in a
paper entitled" The Embossed Stamps of Natal and some others " which was
published in the Pretoria Philatelic Society's Transactions, 1931. This paper
criticises an article by Mr. Patrick Hamilton on " Embossed Natal Reprints"
which appeared in the Philatelic Magazine of August, 1931, and to which reference
will be made later. Mr. Basden's information came from Mr. A. C. Griffin who
after previously acting as Accountant to the Durban Corporation joined the
Government Service in 1888, and became Audit Office Secretary to the Stamp
Commissioners in 1889, a position which he retained until 1899, so that even in
spite of the lapse of time, any statement made by this gentleman should certainly
not be entirely disregarded. Mr. Basden in his paper states that the firm of P.
Davis did not exist in 1857 but that there was a firm in Pietermaritzburg, at that
date, called May & Davis. The partnership was dissolved in December, 1860, and
the business was continued by Peter Davis until 1863, in which year he was joined
by his son, Peter Davis, Junr. The firm now becomes Peter Davis & Son, until 1865
when the second son, Alfred Davis, was admitted, necessitating the alteration of
name to P. Davis & Sons. Mr. Basden comes to the conclusion, after weighing his
information, that it is most improbable that the actual dies should have ever
been permitted to leave the Treasury and that the stamps were almost certainly
produced in the Treasury under the usual departmental control, on paper possibly
supplied by May & Davis. 

He also states that supplies of paper were afterwards
obtained from a firm called E. London who undoubtedly supplied paper for some
of the reprints. The paper, no doubt, originated from London as it is unlikely
that at this date there were any facilities for producing coloured paper in South
Africa. The paper used for the postage stamps was also used for the binding of
the Government gazettes and possibly valuable conclusions could be arrived at
by a study of the paper in the gazettes of the period.

The stamps were, of course, not perforated. The papers used varied in tint somewhat; the 3d. comes in a bright pink tint, occasionally a chalky pink and in a dull, flat shade. It is also found in a brownish-pink colour, but this is probably not a natural colour but rather a discoloration due to the effect of the climate on the gum or to the composition of the gum itself. The 6d. varies from green to bluish green. The 9d. is on dull
blue paper varying from a medium to a darker shade, and the paper used for the
1/-, when fresh, is well described as a pinkish buff, although the early chroniclers
describe it as cafe au lait.

The id. stamp, as is well known, comes on three varieties of coloured paper.
The usual explanation of this fact is that three papers were used owing to the
small supplies of paper available. Suggestions will be provided later which would
seem to admit of other and more satisfactory reasons for this variation of papers.
There is little doubt that the first supplies of the id. value were embossed on the
blue paper used for the gd. value. This is perhaps natural as the gd. was the
value least used. This stamp is the only variety of the id. which is found for
the most part with one of the early postmarks.

Mr. Griffin, who in 1891 was agent in South Africa for Mr. William Brown
of Salisbury, wrote one of the few articles which have appeared in the Press on
the subject of the " Early Natal Stamps." This article appeared in the Philatelic
Journal of America of April, 1891, Vol. VII, page 139. Although certain inconsistencies
appear in this article, as is perhaps natural in view of the fact that it
was written in 1890 or 1891 and that the author has stated elsewhere that he
was at school in 1873—sixteen years after the issue of the embossed stamps—
several most interesting statements are made and particulars given which must
have some basis of fact. It is not necessary to quote the whole article, but certain
paragraphs are of interest and can be critically discussed.

" On the 9th October, 1856, the late Mr. Robert Tatham wrote to the Government
suggesting that the time had arrived when greater postal facilities should
obtain than at present existed. In this letter he enclosed three impressions of
the 3d. stamp which he had obtained from the Registrar of Deeds : two were
on pink and the third on yellow paper. One of the pink specimens was obliterated
at the General Post Office and the obliteration chemically tested. The result of
this was the Government Notice No. 41 of 1857 " (referred to earlier in the chapter).


"During the first month of the use of the postage stamps the Government
authorities found out that they were being used on deeds for revenue purposes
(hence the Government Notice No. 49 of 1857 also referred to previously).
Mr. Griffin then gives details with regard to the sales of the gd. stamp, the
value most generally used on deeds, during the months of June and July, 1857.

" During June and July the sales of 9d. stamps were 108, so deducting the
number that would presumably be required for postal service—which I put down
at about seventy-five—it will be seen that very few were used for revenue
documents."

This practice, of course, ceased after the publication of Government Notice
No. 49, which also makes it quite clear that the embossed stamps on coloured
paper were issued for postal purposes only.
Mr. Griffin continues :

\begin{quotation}
" The id. embossed stamps were first issued on the 4th September, 1859
(? 1857), and were generally on blue paper, a few being subsequently issued on
pink buff and yellow paper."
\end{quotation}

The number of stamps actually struck off on coloured paper and sold were
as below :

id. 3d. Cd. gd. ij-
Struck off . . . 27,467 219,367 21,797 3,665 8,094
Returned [sic] to the
Commissioners of Stamps
on July igth, 1859  9.443 2,469 1,402 2,493
Actually sold . . 27,467 209,924 19,328 2,263 5,601

No stamps of the values 6d., 9d. or 1/- were sold after July igth, 1859,
which to a certain extent will account for the large proportion of 3d. stamps being
used.

" With regard to the stamps returned to the Commissioners on the igth August,
1859, it is stated that they were burnt, but up to the present I have failed to find
any official confirmation of this."
Certain comments and queries naturally arise in connection with these statements.
It should be noted in view of what is written later that certain of the
penny stamps are said to have been embossed on yellow paper.
Two dates are given in regard to the return of stamps, viz. July igth, 1859,
and August igth, 1859. One of these is manifestly an error, but it would be
interesting to know which is right.
The Perkins, Bacon. 3d. stamps were shipped on May 2nd, 1859, and should
have arrived well within the two months, so "that the earlier date is probably
correct.

A query also arises as to the exact meaning of the word " returns." This
word might refer to " returns " by letter from the post offices of the number of
stamps sold or in stock at the various centres or it might mean physical returns,
i.e. actual stamps sent in to the Head Office. It is certain that the 6d. stamps,
at any rate, continued in use as they are found postmarked down to the latter
end of 1861, and the 9d. and 1/- are also found with the numeral cancellation
which was probably not used before the issue of the first Perkins, Bacon stamps.

There is little doubt that July igth or August igth, 1859, saw what was practically
the last of the 3d. embossed. It is, however, quite possible that the comparatively
small stock was used up, as this stamp is also found with the numeral cancellation.
The id. blue had probably come to an actual end ; there were none in stock, and
as the pink paper was no longer required it is suggested that a printing of the id.
was made about this date on the pink paper which filled in the gap between
July igth, 1859, and the arrival about the middle of February, 1860, of the first
Perkins, Bacon id. stamps. On the basis of the numbers given for the id. blue,
a supply for seven months would have entailed the embossing of some nine to
ten thousand stamps. The comparatively few copies of this stamp which have
survived have normally the numeral cancellation and copies with other obliterations
should be suspect. It will be shown subsequently how used id. pink stamps
were fabricated at a later date.

The above is not an unreasonable explanation for the occurrence of the id.
stamp on pink paper, but there still remains to be tackled the question of the
id. on buff.

The Rev. C. S. Morton, some years ago, obtained much interesting information
from the Record Office in London ; more recently Mr. Percy de Worms has
delved even deeper and certain information in Chapter I was kindly provided by
the latter gentleman. The result of Mr. Morton's search was given by him in an
article in the London Philatelist, Vol. XXXVII, pages 205-207, entitled " The
First Postage Stamps of Natal." Here it is stated that the Lieutenant-Governor,
John Scott, wrote under date July 6th, 1859, No. 60 :
" Sir, In my despatch of September 6th of last year I forwarded a requisition
on the Agent General for a Postage Stamp Die, and as soon as it should be finished
for 120,000 postage stamps for the use of the Colony. The postage stamps now
used for the prepayment of letters in Natal are struck off from dies in the possession
of the Distributor of Stamps, and are the same as those employed in stamping
legal documents. The}7 are a clumsy substitute for the usual postage stamps, and
are prepared with difficulty, and I shall therefore be glad to receive the postage
stamps applied for in the requisition above alluded to."
"2. I have the honour to transmit another requisition for the engraving of
another Postage Die and for a supply of 120,000 stamps. These stamps of the
value of one penny are for the purpose of prepaying newspapers."
These id. stamps were shipped per the Cadiz on December 3rd, 1859. This
was the second consignment of stamps from Perkins, Bacon, and there is nothing
remarkable about the next two consignments. The next, however, the fifth,
calls for considerable comment. This consisted of a parcel of 360,000 3d. blue
stamps which had been printed in error against a requisition by the Colonial
Secretary of Natal for a similar number of stamps of the id. value. These stamps
were despatched in April and May, 1861, from London. The natural consequence
was an urgent letter from the Lieutenant-Governor on January 2nd, 1862, for
id. stamps as " there was no supply of penny stamps in the Colony owing "

No means of perforating the stamps was available, so they had to be cut from the sheet with scissors as they were sold. The 3d. stamp was impressed on a rose coloured paper, the 6d. on green, the 9d. on blue and the 1/-on buff paper. In every case the colouring went through the paper. Each value was of a different design, but basically all the designs consisted of the word 'Natal' at the top, then a crown between the letters
V.R. (Victoria Regina), and below that the value in words. All this was surrounded, or partially surrounded, by a frame the style of which was different for each value. The dies, or at any rate those used for the production of the postage stamps, were made by B. Wyon of London.

A 1d. value was added to the series early in 1858, the die for this stamp being somewhat smaller than the other dies and not containing the letters V.R.; the style of lettering was also different. It is not known where this die came from, but it was certainly not as well executed as the other dies. At the outset the 1d. die was impressed on blue paper, but later rose paper was used and then buff, presumably to use up stocks of paper left over from the other stamps.

More than one reprint was made. They can be distinguished by the brighter colours and clearer embossing than that of the 
original and slightly glazed paper.

All of the 1857 Natal Embossed values are scarce or rare, but when they 
do make their infrequent appearance of the market they are invariable 
in used condition. Only a tiny number of unused or mint copies have ever 
been certified and nearly all of those have been the Three Pence value. 
The stamp has a long storied history. It was first declared genuine in 
1956 by Robson Lowe, who signed the accompanying BPA certificate at that time. 
Since then it has graced some of the most important British Commonwealth 
collections ever assembled. It remains unpriced in both Scott and Stanley 
Gibbons, due to its infrequent appearance at public auction.

An important rarity of the British Commonwealth, or the whole world 
for that matter. Accompanied by 1956 BPA, 1973 Alberto Diena and 
2007 Brandon certificates; ex-Bowlby, "Midas", Melat and "Samos". (S.G. #6). 

The stamp re-appeared in the market in March 2012 at the Spinks Shreeves Collector's 
auction at an estimate of Est. $40,000-50,000 and realizing $55,000.00

The method of producing the stamps was obviously quite unsuitable, especially as the embossing machine was apparently so constructed that it could emboss only two rows of stamps on the sheet, which then had to be turned round to take two rows on the opposite side. It seems unlikely that the Treasury would have been willing to relinquish control of the dies, so the production of the stamps must have been carried out at the Treasury itself. The appearance of the stamps was poor and, having to be cut from the sheet with scissors as they were sold, their size varied greatly. 

In a letter written to the Colonial authorities in London on 6 July 1859, the Governor described the stamps as 'a clumsy substitute for the usual postage stamps and prepared with difficulty', and asked that the new stamps which had been ordered on 6 September 1858 should be despatched as early as possible. 

Actually, the new stamps, of the value of 3d., and supplied by Perkins Bacon & Co. of London, were already on their way to Natal and must have arrived soon after the letter had been written. New 1d. stamps arrived early in 1860, but new 6d. stamps were not received until 1863 -this notwithstanding the fact that the 6d., 9d. and 1/-embossed stamps had been withdrawn, along with the embossed 3d. value, in July 1859.
