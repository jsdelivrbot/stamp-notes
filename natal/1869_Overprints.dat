\chapter{1869 Overprints}

AN ordinance was passed in the year 1869 " to confine the use of Postage Stamps
to the purposes of Postage," and a few days before it came into force a proclamation
was published in the Natal Government Gazette of August 24th of that year.

This necessitated all the postage stamps then in use, i.e. the id., 3d., 6d. and
1/- values, being overprinted with the word " POSTAGE ". A set of fiscal adhesives
had already been issued on January ist, "1869, to include the 1d., 3d., 6d., 9d.
and 1/- values. These stamps were embossed from the old fiscal dies on coloured surfaced
paper and perforated 12\half. Specimens of the 1d. are known to have been
postally used, but they were never authorised postage stamps and were obviously
debarred from postal use after the passing of the aforementioned ordinance.
The stamps were overprinted locally and owing, no doubt, to the restricted
facilities a variety of types was used for the overprinting. These stamps can be distingusihed from later prints by the dot that is present after the "POSTAGE".


\section{Plating}

To make up the settings of these stamps was always a puzzle, and it was
obvious that little progress could be made towards any solution unless or until
a full sheet of the 1d., stamp was available.

An opportunity was missed when what must have been a whole or part sheet
of Perkins, Bacon id. stamps, imperforate and without gum, was discovered.
These stamps came, no doubt, from the earliest printings by Messrs. Perkins,
Bacon, and were therefore printed from the plate in its earliest state ; consequently
they would not have been so valuable for plating purposes as stamps from a
later printing.

After this came the " Mayfair Find." This was, unfortunately, split up, but
blocks when available lend invaluable aid.

A full sheet, however, of the 1d. stamp was unprocurable until the break-up
of the Lincoln stock. It was stated that there were five full sheets of the £d. on
id. yellow of 1877, of which all but one were split up. Luckily this particular
sheet is still in being, and although it lacked twenty-four stamps a complete
reconstruction has been effected by the addition of the two missing blocks of
twelve stamps.

A photograph of this sheet shows up all the major plate varieties and scratches,
but in itself would be insufficient for the purpose for which it was required, i.e.
the plating of the overprinted stamps. It has, however, made it possible to plate
the blocks of the "Mayfair Find" and to place a large block of the 1d. CC in
brownish lake. From these blocks and from the photograph, a large number of
the individual overprinted 1d. stamps in one of its shades can be placed.

As given in Stanley Gibbons' Catalogue, there are five main types. The order
of types on the sheet is not, however, that of the catalogue.

Type I. Is the overprint with "POSTAGE" i2f mm. long (Stanley Gibbons,
2nd type).

Type II. Is the overprint with "POSTAGE" 14£, 15 J mm. long (StanJey
Gibbons, 4th type).

Type III. Is the overprint'with "POSTAGE" 13 mm. long (Stanley Gibbons,
3rd type)

Type IV. Is the overprint with "POSTAGE" with a stop (Stanley Gibbons,
5th type).

Type V. Is the overprint with "POSTAGE" in tall capitals (Stanley Gibbons,
1st type).


It is proposed to refer to the types of the overprint in this chapter in their
correct order.
Now almost the first point the student notices in examining any quantity of
the id. value is that Types I, II, III and V of the overprint are never found at the
top or in the middle of the stamp, whereas stamps with Type IV of the overprint
can be found more commonly with the overprint at the top than at the bottom.
This has so far been found to be invariably the case in respect to the id. value.
The only explanation is obviously that there were two settings of the overprint:
(A) A setting of 240, showing all five types.
(B) A setting with Type IV only. This setting was probably made owing to
the difficulty of overprinting the i/- stamps with their " gutters." It was probably
a setting of 60 (6xio) to fit the panes of the i/-. In any case it is unlikely to
have been larger, as it is practically certain that there were not more than sixty
examples of this type in the first setting. It should be possible eventually to
reconstruct this setting.

To plate the id. stamps of the setting A, it is necessary to concentrate on the
overprinted id. in the brownish-lake shades, as the rose-carmine stamps are in the
majority of cases (other than the standard plate varieties) not plateable.
The loth row of the sheet shows the letter watermark at the bottom of most
stamps. This row is, therefore, comparatively easy to plate, and the overprints
are always Type III. These overprints also come on stamps showing no sign of
the letter watermark and, therefore, at least some of the stamps on the row above

majority of cases (other than the standard plate varieties) not plateable.
The loth row of the sheet shows the letter watermark at the bottom of most
stamps. This row is, therefore, comparatively easy to plate, and the overprints
are always Type III. These overprints also come on stamps showing no sign of
the letter watermark and, therefore, at least some of the stamps on the row above
should also be Type III, i.e. Rows 9 and 10 contain Type III. Actually the first
three or four stamps in Row 9 are likely to be Type II, as although the fifth stamp
in this Row (No. 101) is overprinted with Type III, the third stamp (No. 99) is
overprinted with Type II.

A vertical strip of 3 is in existence showing Type I, with two examples of
Type II below. Thes% can be plated and are actually Nos. 65, 77 and 89 on the
sheet. Type I, therefore, comes on the 6th row, Type II on Rows 7 and 8. A
block of 12 (4 X 3) is known of the 3d., Type I, with top sheet margins—incidentally
the only unused block known of any of the stamps of Types I, II, III and V. This
gives Type I on Rows i, 2 and 3 of the sheet, and as Type I also comes on Row 6,
one may reasonably deduce that the whole of the first six rows of the sheet were
surcharged with Type I.

It would not be a matter of practical politics to plate either the seventy-two
stamps of this type or the sixty of Type IV or of Type V which, it is hoped to
show, completed the setting, more especially as it would be necessary to rely
entirely upon stamps of the brownish-lake colour, but it may be remarked that
any single stamps that have been plated conform to this arrangement. There
is just the possibility that the horizontal rows were not all completed with one
type, in which case types would be found in se tenant horizontal pairs. This,
however, is unlikely and no such pair has yet been found, although Types II and
III must have existed in this condition.
It should be possible to plate the four rows with Types II and III. To do so
in the case of Type II would be especially interesting, as the types vary in length.
The nth row of the sheet gives stamps which show the letter watermark
at the top of the stamp. These are invariably Type IV.

The " tear " stamp on Row 16 (2nd vertical and i6th horizontal row of the
sheet), No. 182, is found with Type V of the overprint. This type is also found
on the abnormal No. 204. It has long been known to occur on the bottom row
of the sheet.

The make-up of the complete setting is therefore :

Rows 1-6 inc. Type I. 72 stamps.
,, 7-8 and part 9 inc. ,, II. 27 or 28 stamps.
„ part 9-10 inc. ,, III. 21 „ 20
,, 11-15 ,, ,, IV. 60 stamps.
,, 16-20 ,, ,, V. 60


The same setting was used for the 3d. and 6d. values, but nothing quite so
definite can be said with regard to distinguishing Type IV of the first setting from
the stamps of the second setting, at any rate in so far as the 3d. value is concerned.
On this stamp the normal position of the overprint for the first setting appears
to be at the top or the middle of the stamp and that for the second setting at the
bottom—the direct opposite to the arrangement for the overprinting of the id.
value—but copies of the 3d. with Types I, II, III and V of the overprint can
occasionally be found with the overprint at bottom.

It is perhaps not advisable in connection with any examination of these overprints
to consider the 3d. value as either normal or typical. Whereas in the case
of the id. and 6d. values large quantities remained in stock in their original
unoverprinted condition to serve for provisional issues of a later date, this was not
the case as regards the 3d. stamps, which seem to have been used up, and,
probably for this reason, a quantity of part sheets and blocks of stamps are likely
to have been overprinted, a possibility which would lead to complications.
The 6d. appears to follow the 3d. as regards overprinting. The stamps of the
second setting show the overprint at the bottom.

The I/- was probably overprinted with Setting A, but there must have been
some spacing out of the setting to overcome the difficulty of the blank spaces in
the gutters and between the top and bottom halves of the sheet.
The normal distance between the overprints of Type I is 7 1/2 mm., but on a pair
of the 3d. value we have seen, the distance is no less than loj mm. The gutters
on the pane of the i/- measure 11 mm., or making allowance for the perforation
space on each side, 9 mm. It would therefore be just possible to cover the gutter
space by a distance of io-| mm. between overprints. The pair of 3d. stamps in
question may thus conceivably have been overprinted with the setting as prepared
for the i/- value.

The i/- stamps of the first setting are scarce, Types II and III being real
rarities; the overprints come frequently off centre, and no doubt the second setting
came into being owing to the difficulties of overprinting this value with the large
setting, and possibly also because of the necessity of resetting it once again to
overprint a fresh batch of the lower values. The stamps of the second setting
have the overprint invariably at the top, in the first setting they come on the
lower part of the stamp.

A pair of the 3d. exists with the overprint Type IV at bottom of the stamps
(Setting B), very much out of position ; the second stamp, to which is attached
a considerable part of a third stamp, shows only the " TAGE " of " POSTAGE " at
the extreme left. The right part of the stamp and the portion attached show
no overprint whatever, so that obviously the second stamp is the outside stamp
of the setting, thus proving that this setting could not have been large  to cover the full breadth of the sheet.
