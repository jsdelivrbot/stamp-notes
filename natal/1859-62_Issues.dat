\chapter{1859-62 The Perkins Bacon Stamps} 

The records open with a 'Requisition from Natal', dated November 10, 1858, and forwarded by the Agents-General to Perkins Bacon, who submitted their Tender for \pound111 to prepare drawing and engraving an original steel die, hardening and transferring the same to a steel roller, hardening that and from thence engraving a folio plate containing 240 3d postage stamps. They also quoted that the charge for paper, printing, gumming and perforating would be at 1/- per 120,000. The rate for printing was queried by Penrose Julyan but requested that they submit their drawing.

Only a portion of the reply survive at which Bacon explained that the cost was due to excessive wastage on large orders and the cost of the gum which has risen one hundred percent. The stimate was accepted on December 13th 1858. The stamps were to be blue and to be delivered to the office of teh Agents-General, 5 Cannon Row, Westminster, `together with the Die &c in a separate parcel'. This provision was added: `subject to a penalty or deduction from the account, of twenty shillings per diem for every day over & above the period expressed in your tender during which the order shall remain incomplete.' 

The firm acknowledged the acceptance of the tender, and asked for the drawing to be returned. The design, with three Trinidad designs, was returned the following day. The Natal drawing and two unfinished proofs are now in the Royal Collection. 



A similar order was given under date July 6th, 1859, for a 1d. die and for the
same number of stamps (120,000).

The die for the 6d. value, together with an order for 120,000 stamps, was not
requisitioned until July 1st, 1861. It has been mentioned in the first chapter
that the Lieutenant-Governor had suggested in July, 1859, that there should be
a uniform rate of 6d. postage on letters between Natal and the United Kingdom
as enjoyed by the Australian colonies and that the proposal had been finally
agreed in 1861, although the 6d. rate did not actually come into force until
January ist, 1862, shortly after which date the new 6d. stamps would have
arrived.

Meanwhile, further consignments of the lower values had been despatched to
Natal, and the full list is here given of the stamps sent out by Messrs. Perkins,
Bacon & Co. The list is that given by Mr. Morton in the article to which allusion
has already been made, but only the shipment date and quantities are now
detailed.

Bacon receive a notification on June 20, 1859, that the penalty clause previously mentioned would be enforced, and only succeeded in getting a small remission. 

\section{The One Penny Stamp}

The order for the One Penny stamp followed with the same formalities. The requisition from Natal arrived and an estimate dated September 17, 1859 was accepted on September 23. 
Julyan approved the design three days later, and the die was completed by October 18.

While the One Penny plate and stamps were being prepared the Agents-General on October 18, 1859 ordered a further 500 sheets of the 3d blue. They were perforated 14 at Somerset House and were ready for despatch on November 2.

No stamps were required in Natal during 1860, but on March 8, 1861, Perkins Bacon were sked to estimate 1,500 sheets of Threepence stamps; they provided their estimate on March 11, which was accepted two days later with the postcript:


The first three consignments of these stamps were all printed on unwatermarked
paper and were perforated for Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. by the Inland Revenue
authorities at Somerset House. The perforating machine was at this time a comb machine giving a perforation of 14. Owing to the close and irregular spacing of
the stamps on the plates, it was a matter of great difficulty to perforate the stamps
at all regularly and there must have been a considerable wastage as is evidenced
by the many badly perforated stamps that were issued,

\ph[50%]{../natal/13027_904_1.jpg}{ }  

Actually the first 500 sheets sent to be perforated were returned to Messrs.
Perkins, Bacon & Co. as being impossible to perforate satisfactorily. Messrs.
Perkins, Bacon & Co. thereupon ordered special paper for a second printing of
500 sheets ; these were perforated, but even so some 10 per cent were considered
unfit for use and had to be replaced.



The stamps of consignment No. 4 (3d. value) were also on unwatermarked
paper and were perforated by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. themselves with their
single-line perforating machine, the gauge of which varies from 14 to . Now
this perforating machine had been repaired in December, 1860, and we read in the
Grenada* handbook that 

\begin{blockquote}
" among the stamps perforated during the first three
months of 1861 many examples can be found of the clean-cut perforation as well
as of the ' intermediate state ' to which the machine seems speedily to have
reverted, this stage being reached about the end of January which is not extraordinary
seeing the great number of sheets perforated in that month."
\end{blockquote}

At the end of March, 1861, the perforation from this machine had become
thoroughly blind or rough and from this date is so described in the catalogues.
There is no trace in the records of any Natal stamps having been printed
between November igth, 1859, and March 23rd, 1861, and yet we read in Grenada,
pages 24 and 25, the following passage :

\begin{blockquote}
" Earlier in the same month (March) she (Miss Stewart) perforated 450 sheets
(108,000 stamps) of Natal, Three Pence, in readiness for a large consignment of
this value, which was subsequently sent to the colony on April I5th."
\end{blockquote}

These were, in fact, the last stamps that were perforated by the machine in
its so-called intermediate state.

The question naturally arises as to the origin of these 450 sheets of stamps
seeing that no fresh printings can be traced between the end of November, 1859,
and the end of March, 1861. Mr. Percy de Worms deduces, and there is little doubt
correctly, that these sheets were from the first parcel of all to be printed, which
had been returned early in 1859 by Somerset House as being incapable of
perforation by their comb machine.

In this case a stamp with the " intermediate " perforation must be printed
in one of the early full deep shades of blue characteristic of the early printings
and not in the paler colours which are found subsequently. The converse, however,
that the stamps with the rough perforation can only come in the paler
colour is not 100 per cent correct, as the deep blue stamps are very occasionally
found with the rough perforation, and no doubt some few sheets from the original
parcel must have been included in the batch of stamps perforated at the very end
of March and early April to complete the consignment.

The figures tally approximately. Thus 360,000 were dispatched in two shipments
in April-May, 1861. Between March 23rd and April 6th 1150 sheets were
printed (270,000 stamps). If the 450 sheets referred to above are added, there is
a total of 1600 sheets or 384,000 stamps, leaving a surplus, probably largely
accounted for by wastage, of only 24,000 stamps.

Full particulars as to the dates of printing and the number of stamps printed
at a time, together with similar information in respect to the perforating, will be
given in the book which Mr. Percy de Worms is preparing on the Perkins, Bacon
records.

The stamps with intermediate perforation must obviously be scarcer than
generally supposed.

It is not always an easy matter to distinguish between the intermediate perforation
which is found on these 3d. stamps and certain stamps with the rough
perforation of later consignments, especially in cases where an attempt has been
made by fakers or experimenters to improve a rough perforation into an intermediate,
but the shade of the stamp is an almost decisive factor. The teeth of
the perforation in the intermediate state are pointed or spiked, whereas the holes
of certain varieties to which reference will now be made are rounder, more even,
and the teeth are flatter and not so pointed.

Although after March, 1861, the perforation becomes thoroughly blind and
rough, stamps can nevertheless still be found in which there is an apparent
compound perforation of rough by clean cut. The extract here given again from
Grenada, page 28, affords the explanation

\begin{blockquote}
" It was not possible to do anything to clear the holes in the plate without taking
the machine to pieces, but it was suggested to her (Miss Stewart) that by working
it for a little time on a sheet of greased paper, which would remove by adhesion
such debris of paper as lay immediately below the pins, some improvement might
be effected. Miss Stewart made this experiment on several occasions before
commencing work for the day, but the result was not such as to encourage her to
continue it. She found that, although at first the effect was as expected, and she
managed, after using the greased paper, to get the pins to penetrate through the
sheets, after a very short time the holes filled up again and matters were as bad
as ever. We believe this occasional use of greased paper to be the cause of certain
varieties\ldots clean-cut perforation in one direction, with the usual rough
A2 in the other\ldots What puzzled us was, of course, the curious combination
of the two perforations, but we think the above account sufficiently explains
it, when we reflect that owing to the practice of perforating a great number of
sheets in one direction before readjusting the ' guide plate ' to perforate in the
other, it would not be possible for one and the same sheet to get the benefit of the
greased paper experiment in both directions."
\end{blockquote}

These compound varieties come probably among the stamps printed to
complete the April-May consignment of 1861.

Consignment No. 5 was perforated by the same machine, but the pins had
become blunted and the perforation is invariably roughly punctured.
The Ordinance of August igth, 1862, reducing the inland rate for | oz. letters
from 3d. to id., effectually reduced the demand for stamps of the 3d. value, and
no further supplies were required or printed until the 1870-73 issue.
It is interesting in this connection to study the " Postage Stamp Returns for
December, 1864 " given by Mr. Morton, where it is stated that only fourteen 3d.
stamps were sold in the month. The total sales of the id. value amounted to
18,960 and of the 6d. 4482. The stocks in Natal on December 3ist, 1864, were
10,752 id. stamps, 47,615 3d. stamps, 15,840 6d. stamps.

Consignment No. 6 (the 6d. value). The stamps were printed on unwatermarked
paper and the perforation is rough.

The last consignment, No. 7, sent out by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon (1d. value)
was printed on paper watermarked with a small star and the perforation remains
the same as for No. 6.

A sheet or sheets of the id. value imperforate and ungummed, similar in
appearance to the id. Bahamas in this condition, must have leaked out from some
source.

The 3d. is found in the same condition but on Star watermarked paper. Africa
states that on April 22nd, 1862, Messrs. Perkins, Bacon forwarded four sheets
(960 stamps) of the 3d. blue to the Agent-General for the Crown Colonies.
As the id. stamps sent out to Natal on April ist, 1862, were on Star paper it may
be concluded that these four sheets were also printed on watermarked paper.
The}' were never perforated, gummed or issued.

There is a variety of the 3d. showing a marked shift in the printing which
gives the appearance of a double impression. The 3d. with rough perforation
has been found in pairs lacking the perforation horizontally or vertically.
The 3d. value occasionally appears in an apparently imperforate condition.
Mr. Griffin states that such imperforate stamps came from the bottom sheets
of each bundle, which escaped perforation. It is, however, doubtful whether the
stamp exists genuinely imperforate. No satisfactory pairs are known, and it is
not usual in these days to pass single copies of such varieties which occur in the
case of most of the Colonies whose stamps were printed and perforated by Perkins,
Bacon & Co.
