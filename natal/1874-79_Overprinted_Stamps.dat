\chapter{The Overprinted Stamps of 1874-79}


APPARENTLY an insufficient supply of the new 1d. stamps had been despatched
from London, as in July, 1874, only six months after the issue of the surfaceprinted
1d. stamp, a provisional stamp was issued for this value. The stamp to
be overprinted was the 1d. stamp printed by Messrs. De La Rue on paper watermarked
Crown and C C from the Perkins, Bacon plate. Only the stamps in the
brownish-lake colour appear to have been utilised. The overprint is an imitation
of the De La Rue overprint of 1870 ; the word " POSTAGE " reading upwards
on the left side and downwards on the right in roman capitals 13 Xif mm.

It is known double and also misplaced so as to show the overprint on only one
side of the stamp.

Little is as yet known about the setting of this overprint, but a vertical pair
from the central two horizontal rows of the sheet shows the overprints out of
alignment, so that the setting could not have covered more than half the sheet
and was most probably one of 60, 6x10, repeated four times. The distance
between the overprint on each side seems to vary.

A further 1d. provisional was issued in 1875. The same stamps as in the case of the previous emission were utilised, but stocks of the stamps in the rose-carmine
colour as well as those in the brownish lake were overprinted, although the former
colour is much less commonly found than the latter. The stamps are overprinted
with the word "POSTAGE" horizontally in small sans-serif capitals measuring
njxi^mm. The stamp in both shades is known with double overprint. Nothing
definite is known about the setting of this overprint.
There was a further shortage in 1876, this time of more than one value. The
id. stamp of the Perkins, Bacon type, but printed in yellow, was now utilised.
These stamps were fiscals and had been printed by Messrs. De La Rue on Crown
and C C paper, perforated ~LZ\, possibly contemporaneously with those printed
in brownish lake and rose for postal purposes. Further stocks of the id. brownish
lake and some of the 6d. deep violet as well as the i/- green were utilised at the
end of this year. These stamps were all overprinted in the Colony with the word
" POSTAGE " horizontally in roman capitals measuring 14^ to 15 X 2 mm.
24,000 of the yellow stamps are stated to have been overprinted.

It is possible that the type used for this overprint was again utilised for the
overprints of 1877-79, and as in this case the setting for the overprint was a full
one of 240 stamps, it is probable that the setting used for the issue under discussion
was also of 240 subjects. On the other hand it is more than likely that it was
reset for overprinting the i/- stamp and a smaller setting of 60 used for this
purpose.
There are a great many minor type varieties in this overprint; differences in
the size and the shape of the letters abound. Noticeably a very small " p " in
" POSTAGE " is found, as is also a tall and a round " o ".
In the case of the i/- the type seems to have been badly set, as it is not uncommon
to find stamps with the letters of the overprint on different levels. It
may quite definitely be said in the case of this value that the setting is not the
same as that on the 1877-79 stamps.
There is another curious point in connection with these i/- stamps. The
stamps are so fresh in appearance that one could not credit that they should have
been in stock in Natal since 1867, and if they had been in stock, why should the
i/- brown fiscal stamp have been used for the 1873 provisional ? It seems more
than likely that the stamps used for this issue were stamps which had been sent
out from London by error, in an unoverprinted condition. It should be noted
that no i/~ value was included in the 1874-79 issue. The stamp with the green
curved surcharge should have been current at this time, and it seems quite probable
that a consignment was sent out with some of the other values of the 1874
issue in the same unoverprinted condition.

The 6d. of this issue is found with a double overprint, one of which is diagonal;
it also comes more commonly with the overprint inverted. The 1d. lake is found
with the overprint inverted and the 1/- with the overprint double.

The next overprint in order of date is the fd. provisional of February I3th,
1877, on the surface-printed id. rose stamp, the precursor of the permanent Jd.
stamp ; but as the three further provisional on the stamps of the Perkins, Bacon
type follow more naturally as regards character, a consideration of the first
mentioned is postponed until the end of the chapter.

The Natal Government Gazette of February 2Oth, 1877, prints a Post Office
notice : "As Half-penny Postage Stamps have now been provided, it is requested
that all correspondence for foreign countries may be correctly stamped in accordance with the recently published Tariffs." This notice directly refers to
the £d. provisional of February I3th, 1877, on the surface-printed De La Rue id.
carmine-rose, of which 23,760 were issued. This quantity would not have lasted
very long, so a further provisional was issued on October 7th, the yellow fiscal
stamp being again utilised. Three days later stocks of the old 6d. stamps were
utilised for a provisional id. stamp.
These two provisionals were overprinted " POSTAGE " in roman capitals and,
underneath, " Halfpenny" and " One Penny" with initial capitals and small
letters, the original values of the stamps being obliterated by three straight bars.
These bars vary in practically every row and thus often the stamps of one
horizontal row can be distinguished from another.
That an identical setting was used in the case of both stamps for both the
" POSTAGE " and the bars can be proved by the fact that it is possible to ascertain
the exact ppsition on the sheet, of blocks of the id. on 6d. stamps, by a study of
the sheet of the £d. on id. yellow. The setting of the overprint was a large one of
240, covering the whole sheet.
There are a number of minor type varieties in the lettering of the word
" POSTAGE ", and it is more than probable that the type used was that used for
the 1875 overprinting. In many cases it has become, or is becoming, very worn.
There appears to be one major variety which is constant, i.e. the stamp with
the " s " missing from " POSTAGE ". This variety is the 3rd stamp of the 3rd
horizontal row (No. 27) and not, as stated in Africa, the 3rd stamp in the 8th row
unless, as is unlikely, there were two settings of the type. A second stamp
comes with the " T " of " POSTAGE " wholly or partially missing. This is No. 223,
but it is probable that this variety is due not to the dropping of a letter but to
defective printing.

Misplaced surcharges are not uncommon with somewhat freakish results.
There are a quantity of errors, inverted, doubles, etc., which will be listed at
the end of the chapter.

We have in addition seen an apparently genuine copy of the id. stamp with
the word " POSTAGE " omitted, probably No. i of the sheet. Copies are also
known of the £d. provisional with this error. 56,640 of the £d. on id. were issued
and 234,960 of the id. on 6d.

The 1d. value must have run short again early in 1879, as on February 12th
of that year another provisional stamp was issued. This time the 6d. pink fiscal
stamp, a companion in all respects to the 1d. yellow fiscal, was overprinted with
the same type and the same setting as the 1d. on 6d. stamps of 1877. There
must have been an acute shortage at this particular time as a quantity of what
might be called " printers' waste " in the overprints was apparently issued in the
regular way over the post office counter. Stamps overprinted four times are not
usually accepted by collectors without a certain amount of protest, but these
particular stamps do not seem to have come out through any irregular channel.
There were 96,000 of these stamps issued.

Again, in the case of this stamp we have also seen an apparently genuine copy
with the word " POSTAGE " omitted.

\section{The Halfpenny Provisional}
We must now revert to the first halfpenny provisional of February, 1877.
This was made by overprinting the one penny stamp of 1874 with the word
"HALF" in roman capitals and the numeral "1/2". The two overprints were not
printed at the same time and probably the numeral was imposed first, found not
satisfactory, and then reinforced by the "HALF" overprint.

\end{figure*}

E.W. Mann writing in the London Philatelist mentioned that at least three panes of these overprinted stamps are in existence. The late Mr. Gordon Smith in an article on these halfpenny provisionals in Stanley Gibbons
Monthly Journal of January 3ist, 1900  (Vol. X), gives as his opinion that the
settings varied on each pane of a sheet and that therefore the stamps were overprinted
in full settings of 240 stamps. Two full panes of 60 have now been
examined from different parts of the sheet and the numeral overprints on either
pane are identical, so that Mr. Gordon Smith's conclusions seem to have been
erroneous so far as the numeral part of the overprint was concerned. It is also
much more likely that sheets divided into panes as these stamps were by the
" gutters " should have been overprinted by settings of 60 to fit the panes. It
is, however, possible that the "HALF" setting was a larger one.

Curiously enough, in this article the author also states that the "POSTAGE"
error on the 1877-79 provisionals was the jrd stamp on the 8th row.
The types of the fractional numeral on this stamp are most confusing, and
although the different varieties are listed both in Africa and in Messrs. Stanley
Gibbons' Catalogue, it is doubtful whether all these varieties can be identified
with certainty. The type is usually very indistinct and therefore the varieties
of the stamps with the fraction 3\alf mm. high and small "2" are almost undistinguishable
in many cases.

The full examination of a pane gives the following results; it will be seen that
six major types are shown.

The pane is the left upper pane of a sheet showing the "current" number
"2" in a fancy rectangle over the 2nd stamp.


Rows 1-6. 

No. 1. "1/2" with straight foot, approx. 4 mm. high (the
"2" varies occasionally in shape). Type I

It will be seen that Types I and II are by far the commonest varieties.
An examination of a full sheet of the |d. on the id. yellow provisional is hardly
so edifying, but it will, perhaps, be of some interest to note a few of the more
prominent defects or varieties.
It should be noted that the three bars of the overprint vary in thickness, but
the normal arrangement seems to be thin, thick, thin, when the ink is not too
heavy.

Row 2. No. 6. Defective " s".

Row 12. No. i. Round " o ".
No. 5. Small "P".
ftow 13. No. 6. Small " A ".
No. ii. Small round " o ".
Row 14. No. 8. Defective " E ".
Row 15. No. 7. " s " has almost disappeared.
No. 9. " E " raised.
Row 17. No. 12. Cut through " G " and " E ".
Row 18. No. 12. Defective " G ".
Row 19. No. i. Small " p ".
No. 5. Small " A ".
No. 6. Defective " G ".
No. 7. " T " almost gone.
Row 20. No. 3. " T " raised.

It will be seen that except for a few differences in the letters most of these
varieties are due to wear and tear of the type.
