\chapter{1867 One Shilling}    

In the year 1866 Messrs. De La Rue & Co. were asked to provide a stamp of
the value of 1/—. This stamp was issued in April, 1867. It was surface-printed
on the Crown and CC paper and perforated 14. The stamp became necessary to accommodate the new rate to Great Britain.

 (D5), part original gum, separated with
scissors and imperforate on two sides; very rare. Photo \pound500-600}

The sheet consisted of 240 stamps, separated into four panes of 60 stamps
consisting of ten horizontal rows of 6 stamps. The panes were separated by blank
gutters; the vertical gutter between the panes is half an inch in width, whilst
the horizontal gutter is nearly one inch wide.

The division of the panes down the sheet was effected by means of a single
line of perforation which resulted in forty stamps on each sheet showing a white
margin of about 5 mm. inside the perforation, one half on the right side, the other
on the left. This was the usual method, of separation in connection with all
typographed stamps printed by Messrs. De La Rue in their earlier operations
