Africa describes three vertical pairs, a pair of the 6d. with Types IV and V,
a pair of id. as also of the 3d. with Types I and III, but almost certainly a mistake
has been made and in either of the latter pieces the types should be I and II.
It is not very difficult to confuse Types II and III in the case of certain stamps.
A further pair is mentioned which was described in Stanley Gibbons' Monthly
Journal for April, 1892, a pair of 3d. with Types III and IV. Allusion.has earlier
been made to the strip of three id. stamps with Types I, II and II.
A study of the combination of colour and setting will enable the collector to
pick up some scarce varieties.

It will be seen that because a stamp with Type IV can be found with double
or inverted overprint, it does not mean that all the types must have existed in
this condition.

As regards the overprinted stamps, catalogued with the Somerset House
perforation, stamps with Type IV of the overprint seem to come fairly frequently
and no doubt belong to the second setting. It is somewhat curious that of these
stamps with the other types of overprint (Setting I), only stamps with Type I
of this setting seem to be at all readily procurable. This stamp can be found,
but stamps overprinted with the other three types appear to be of considerable
rarity. We have seen one genuine example of Type III but none of Type II.
As a solution of this inconsistency it is suggested that it was probably necessary
to overprint some parts or fragments of sheets, and in this case the top part of
the setting with Type I could have been used exclusively.

The only type varieties seen consist of a large " s " in Type I on the id., 3d.
and 6d. values. This is probably No. 29 of the setting. Type I is also found on
the i/- with a raised " T ".

In Type V one occasionally conies across a variety with the " GE " of
" POSTAGE " abnormally spaced.


A study of these stamps should be valuable to collectors, as there are dangerous
forgeries and would no doubt be more if the stamps were more popular.
The 3d. and i/- from the second setting exist with double overprint.
There is a copy of the 1d. Type I in the Royal Collection in the brownish-lake
shade which is doubly overprinted, one of the overprints being lightly impressed.
There is a curious postmark to be found occasionally on these stamps consisting
of a single-lined circular figure surrounding the letters " s.v." It is also found
on the stamps in manuscript. The " s.v." probably stands for Spring Vale, a
post office possibly lacking, at this time, an obliterator.
