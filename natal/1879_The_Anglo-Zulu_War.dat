###1879 The Anglo-Zulu War
The Anglo-Zulu War was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the Zulu Empire. 
From complex beginnings, the war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, 
as well as for being a landmark in the timeline of colonialism in the region. 
The war ended the Zulu nation's independence.

Postal history items from this conflict are identified via their markings, mostly being soldiers' letters addressed to England
with regimental and other similar markings. They form an interesting part of the Postal History of both Natal as well as 
Zululand. Some postal items entered Natal via the Transvaal and these are well sought  by collectors.
