\chapter{Postal Fiscals}

A SET of embossed fiscal stamps on surfaced white paper and perforated I2\
was issued on January 1st, 1869, and presumably all were available for postage
prior to the enforcement of the law of 1869, which directed that the postal and
revenue stamps should be kept distinct from one another, and which incidentally
was the cause of the postage stamps having to be overprinted at the end of that
year. Actually no claim has been made that any value of this set performed
postal service except the id. yellow which from early days was known as a Postal
Fiscal. There can be little doubt that there was never official authorisation for
any fiscal stamps to be used for postal purposes, but probably they were passed
by postmasters when, as was sometimes the case, supplies of actual postage
stamps were missing.

After 1869, when it was quite definite that fiscal stamps could not be used
for postal purposes, the only excuse for passing letters stamped with fiscals
through the post would have been a shortage.
The i/- brown is occasionally found with a legitimate postmark, as also the
id. yellow, and as the i/- brown was actually surcharged " Postage " in 1874,
a brown stamp without surcharge might easily have slipped through. Similarly
with the id. yellow (Perkins, Bacon design) we have seen this postmarked 1875,
the very time when the same stamp with the " Postage " surcharge was in use.
The 6d. is not nearly so plausible a stamp.

The higher values of the De La Rue typographed " Revenue " stamp type
appear in the catalogue as " Postal Fiscals " because they were no doubt available
for postage when the combined Postage and Revenue high value Edwardian
stamps were issued. It is indeed stated that the £1 stamp was, for a short time,
in general use owing to a shortage of the Edwardian £i. This stamp was printed
from both dies. One may, however, query to what extent any of these higher
value stamps were required for actual postal purposes, seeing that up to 1902-3
Natal had been satisfied with a 5/- stamp as the highest denomination of the postal
series.
