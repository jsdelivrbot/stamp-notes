\section{The London Overprinted Stamps of 1870-73 and the localy overprinted 1/- of 1873}

A REQUISITION was made on January 21st, 1870, for 400 sheets of 1/- postage
stamps " with the word 'Postage' printed on the face of each stamp in a manner
shown on the stamp hereto annexed."

At the same time for " 400 sheets of one penny stamps with the words, etc.
. . . annexed."

There is added : " the word ' Postage ' if possible to be in white provided that
a new die is not required to be made."

These stamps were no doubt urgently required as the overprinted stamps of
1869 could only be regarded as a stop-gap, but it seems strange that the 3d. and
6d. values were not ordered at the same time as the other two values.
The 3d. was a value not in great demand at this time and the stock of the
unoverprinted 6d. was, as is evident from the figures of the later overprints,
abnormally large.

The three lower values were printed on the CC paper perforated 12 1/2. The
overprint in sans-serif capitals runs in a straight line upwards on the left side
and downwards on the right. Nothing is known as to the make-up of the setting,
but, as in the case of other early De La Rue overprints, stereos were no doubt
used, and a setting made of a number of subjects which was repeated to overprint
a full sheet, or a full setting was made to cover the whole sheet. The overprint
is in black on the id. and the 6d., and in red-brown on the 3d.

917 P 1870-73 "POSTAGE" 1d. bright red, 3d. bright blue (watermark reversed) and 6d. mauve
imperforate plate proofs, fresh colours, the 1d. with part original gum. A fine and rare
trio. Photo \pound500-600.}   

There are some quite marked shades to be found in the 1d. value and a shade
which is almost prussian blue comes infrequently on the 3d. The colour of the
6d. does not vary, but it is an unsatisfactory colour and liable to oxidisation.
There are no type varieties ; the plates used are the same as in the previous
issue.

All three values can be found imperforate, but they come thus from proof or
" specimen " sheets.

The overprint on the 1/- stamp is in small sans-serif capitals of ij mm. in a
curve following the line of the oval below the Queen's head.

This stamp appears to be scarce in blocks or pieces and although the same type
of overprint is found on the later printings of this value in orange with carmine
overprint, it is impossible as yet to say with any certainty as to how the setting
or settings were made up.

The stamp is also found with the overprint in black or carmine, also in black
with a double overprint, the first example to the left being very faint. These

varieties probably came from the issuing of one or two sheets of trials which were
possibly sent out to the Colony for comparison. They are extremely rare, the
variety with the double being the commonest and that with the carmine easily
the rarest. Used copies should bear the town " 2 " postmark, but, as one would
suppose, very dangerous forgeries exist.

In July, 1873, the supplies of the i/- stamp must have become exhausted.
It will be remembered that 96,000 were sent out in 1870, so that it would appear
that some 38,000 to 39,000 i/- stamps were used per annum at this time. Anyhow,
the fiscal stamp of this value, which was issued in January, 1870, of the same
design as the green postage stamp but in brown, was overprinted locally with
the word " POSTAGE " in roman capitals measuring 16x2^ mm. vertically up the
centre of the stamp. The setting is not known, but it may be conjectured to be
one of sixty subjects to fit the panes
