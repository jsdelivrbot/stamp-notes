\chapter{1859-62 The Perkins Bacon Stamps} 
There were a few remainders of those stamps which came on the market in
1896. Particulars are given by Mr. C. J. Phillips in Stanley Gibbons' Monthly
Journal of January, 1900 (Vol. X) :

"Under 50 stamps." Natal. No wmk. Perf. 14. id. red. Rough perf.
14-16. 6d. grey.

The postmarks of this period are practically confined to the numeral and town
name series which came into use in 1860.

Mention, however, must be made of what, in earlier days, was thought to be
a surcharge. It is the l0d. obliteration in black which on sea-borne letters denoted
the amount payable to the Home Government on the 1/- postage rate. This
rate probably came into force in 1863.
