\section{The Embossed Stamps}

The  first  postage  stamps  of  {{wi:Natal}}  were  issued  on  1st  June,  1857.    
Unfortunately, while Natal was  quite  early in the field  amongst  the 
world's  stamp-issuing  countries,  its  first  stamps  have  never  enjoyed  the 
esteem  and  popularity  enjoyed  by  the  stamps  just  mentioned  and  by  most 
other 'classic' issues of the world.  The other reason of course is that even as early as as 1866, they were virtually unobtainable and as noted in the Stamp Colectors Magazine, Jan. 1, 1866:

\begin{quotation}
Few pages in the albums of collectors present a more blank appearance in general than that allotted to this series : and this
arises from a two-fold source; the extra- ordinary rarity of some individuals requisite to form a perfect and complete set, and the extremely bad condition in which most of
the specimens exist
\end{quotation}

There  was  no  properly  organised  postal  service  in  Natal  until  the  year 
1850.  In terms  of a  proclamation  dated  February  of that  year,  Post  Offices 
were  established  at  Pietermaritzburg,  D'Urban,  Bushman's  River  (later 
Estcourt)  and  Klip  River  (later  Ladysmith).  Previously,  such  limited  postal 
facilities  as  were  called  for  had  been  provided  by  the  various  missionaries 
(mostly  American),  while  between  Pietermaritzburg  and  Durban  the  proprietors  
of  the  Natal  Witness  had  provided  what  they  referred  to  as  a 
'Private Post  established  for  the  satisfaction  of  our subscribers.  and  at  the 
same time to afford facilities for communication to the public'.  

This private 
post  commenced  in  March,  1846,  and  was  soon  being  conducted  on  a 
regular weekly  basis,  the tariff  being  6d.  per sheet.  By the time  the  
Government  postal  service  commenced  in  February,  1850,  the  tariff  had  been 
reduced to  3d.  per sheet. With  the  establishment  of  the Government service. 
the  private  post  terminated. 

After the opening of the initial four  Government post  offices,  further post 
offices were opened from time to time.  Pinetown and Richmond were opened 
later in  1850,  Verulam  in  1851,  Howick,  Mooi  River,  Colenso, Weenen  and 
York  in  1852,  Sterkspruit  (later  Caversham)  in  1853,  Grey town  in  1854, 
Umhlali in  1856,  Umzinto  in  1858,  Isipingo  in  1859  and  many  more  in  the 
l860s.  By  1870  the  number  of  post  offices  in  the  Colony  had  passed  40 
and by 1880 the number was up to 73.

The first stamps of Natal were embossed in relief on plain coloured paper. They were executed at the 
Natal Treasury by May and DDavis, Pietermaritzburg from dies made by William Wyon in London.

More than one reprint was made. They can be distinguished by the brighter colours and clearer embossing than that of the 
original and slightly glazed paper.


\section{1867 Overprints}

These overpints were made to stop the public, using the postage stamps indiscriminately for revenue purposes
and vice-versa. \lorem

These were overprinted by De La Rue as shown in (a) carmine (b)black or (c) green. There were 96,000 printed and they also
exist with __CANCELLED__ as specimens. They can also be found with the overprint double. Blocks are very
scarce from 20N. On cover they from 2N.

Dangerous forgeries exist of (a) and (b) by painting over the genuine green overprint, which is the cheapest
of the lot.
