# The Surface-printed Stamps on Crown and CC Paper,
January 1874-1878

THESE stamps are so well known that very little need be written about them in
this short work. They follow the usual De La Rue method of production. The
lower values are printed in sheets of 120 or 240, separated into panes of 60, 6 x 10,
and the earliest printings show the marginal gutter as described in the-case of
the i/- stamp of 1867. At a later date (vide the stamps on the Crown and C A
watermarked paper) the perforation was adjusted to perforate each side of the
gutter and the central perforation omitted so that the marginal stamps are no
longer found with the border. It is doubtful whether the sheets of the early
1/- stamps exist with plate number, but these (as well as what are known as
" current numbers ") are found on the other values. They are placed over or
under the 2nd stamp of the left-hand panes, and similarly over or under the
5th stamp of the right-hand panes according to the position of the pane on the
sheet.

Marginal lines were added in the case of the later plates, i.e. Plates 3 and 4 of
the 1d. stamp, Plates 2 and 3 of the 1 1/2d. stamp and Plate i of the 2|d. stamp, all
of which were issued later on the Crown and CA paper. There were in all four
plates of the 1d. stamp but only Plates 1 and 2 are found on the CC paper.

  The 5/- stamps were printed probably in sheets of 100, 10 X 10, on the Large
Crown and C C paper. They were originally perforated 15^ x 15 (lake-rose) and
subsequently machine perforated 14 (lake-rose and pink).
The other values were machine perforated 14, but one parcel of the 4d. was
perforated iz\. There is a rare variety of the 3d. which is perforated compound
14 X i2\. This variety was caused by a breakdown of the 14 machine during
the actual perforating of a sheet or sheets of the 3d. stamps, but few stamps can
have been issued in this condition. Possibly als"o the variety of the 4d. with
iaj perforation was the result of this accident.
The id. is found imperforate and also imperforate with the " specimen "
overprint in block letters, in both of which states it can only be considered as a
proof or " specimen " stamp. The other values, i.e. 3d., 4d., 6d., are also found in
imperforate condition.

The 5/-, perf. 14, is sometimes found with the paper slightly blued.
