\chapter{The De La Rue Printed Stamps and the
first Shilling Stamps (1862-69)}

THE plates described in the last chapter were now handed over to the Agents-
General for the Crown Colonies, the 6d. plate on November 15th, 1861, and the
1d. and 3d. plates on January 28th, 1862. The last supply of 1d. stamps printed
by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon and sent out on April ist, 1862, was printed during
March, the plate having been specially returned for the printing of this consignment.

All further stamps after this date were printed by Messrs. De La Rue & Co.
Stamps were ordered in September, 1862, and this order was no doubt executed
by the despatch late in 1862 of the 1d. stamps printed on stout unwatermarked
paper and perf. 13. This paper was probably purchased from T. H. Saunders,
as stamps have been found with a watermark of certain of the letters making
up this name. No less than 732,000 of these stamps were despatched on
December 31st, 1862.

The stamps vary in shade from carmine-lake to brownish lake, but abnormal
shades should be suspect, as some offices were still apparently without regular
postmark stamps and consequently the stamps are found pen-cancelled and, as
an unfortunate corollary, chemically treated and cleaned.

The plate of the 1d. was obviously in a very dirty condition, as stamps on this
paper are almost without exception covered with marks and scratches and are
consequently invaluable for plating purposes. They were, however, not easily
attainable in blocks or pieces prior to the "Mayfair Find." A part sheet of 120
stamps, unfortunately cut up into blocks, was included in this find. The stamps
formed the greater part of the top of a sheet and it is certain that the first seven
horizontal rows of the sheet were complete except for the first three stamps in
the 3rd, 4th and 5th horizontal rows.

Imperforate stamps of this issue can be found, which undoubtedly come
from proof sheets.

The next printings were all prepared on the paper watermarked Crown over
C C. The watermark appears in its normal position but also reversed, inverted,
or inverted and reversed. The full sheet shows the watermark in four panes
of 60 subjects, each pane enclosed in a rectangle, with the words " CROWN
COLONIES '' in block letters running across the sheet between the two upper and
two lower panes. Letters thus appear, together with a portion of the watermark
proper, on stamps from the loth and nth. rows of the sheet. The side-margins
of the sheets each bear the watermark " CROWN COLONIES " repeated twice.
The first parcel of stamps (6d.) was shipped on July 6th, 1863. These were
printed in the lilac-mauve colour.

The first supplies of the CC 1d. stamps were printed from apparently cleaned
plates in shades of brownish lake. These were followed by a printing or printings
from over-inked plates in paler colours which are described in Messrs. Stanley
Gibbons' catalogues as "rose." A better description would be " madder rose,"
but as stamps of these printings and those of the earlier ones become more or less impossible to separate in the case of the later overprinted stamps, owing to the effect of age and climate, it seems less confusing to designate all these shades
as being shades of lake. The Society's work on Africa, Part II, describes them
as " brownish lake, lake (shades)." A third group then appears in a colour which
would be called technically " alizarin scarlet." To the ordinary eye this colour
is much nearer " rose " than its predecessor. It is possibly the " dull rose " of
Africa but the "bright red" presumably of the catalogues. The last stamps
printed on this paper (in unoverprinted condition) do, however, come in a colour
which might be called " bright red " or " bright rose," but which would perhaps
be more properly designated as " venetian-red." These stamps have more colour
and are more coarsely printed than the earlier ones ; they can possibly also be
distinguished by the paper which is thicker and less consistent in texture.
Stamps in the second colour, and to a lesser degree those of the first printing,
can almost invariably be plated owing to the visibility through over-inking of
almost innumerable scratches and dots on the stamps.

The next group provides comparatively few stamps which can be plated with
certainty and the last group none at all except the more important varieties
where there has been serious damage to the plate. Unfortunately, when we
come to the 1869 overprints it will be found that stamps in the last two shades
are considerably commoner than those overprinted on the stamps in the lake
shades.

There must have been several printings of the 6d. stamp. It was used for
the overprintings of 1869 and 1875, and no less than 243,960 were overprinted
in 1877 and again 216,000 in 1895.

The lilac-mauve colour was the fir.st used, after which the colour changed to
deep violet. The latter stamps are found clearly printed in a distinctive shade
and then more heavily inked and blurred. On some stamps the aniline of the
ink shows very clearly, but there are all sorts of intermediate stages between
stamps on coarse, cream-tinted paper and thinner paper with the aniline showing
clearly.

Imperforate specimens exist of both the 1d. rose and 6d. violet. These, as in
the case of the imperforate stamps on unwatermarked paper, come from proof
sheets.
