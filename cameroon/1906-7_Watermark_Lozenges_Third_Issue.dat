The Third Issue.
In January, 1906, the 5pf value was
issued on the paper watermarked loz- enges like that used for the Imperial
stamps in 1905. The lOpf value on the same paper was issued in the following year and the 5 marks in 1913, but since then no others have appeared. It would
appear, therefore, that either very large stocks of the issue of 1900 were supplied or that the demand for stamps in the Cameroons is strictly limited. Reference List.
