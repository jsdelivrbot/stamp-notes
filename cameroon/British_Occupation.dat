Combined military operations were commenced by French and British expeditions in the very early stages of the
Great War, however, the local resistance encountered was so stubborn, that it was not until February, 1916, that this German West African Colony
was finally surendered to the allies.

By mid-summer, 1915, however, a sufficiently large area of territory was in the occupation of the British and allied forces for
the need of postage stamps to make itself manifest. Up to that time all correspondence emananting in the British sphere of influence
had been of a purely official character, and accordingly passed free, under frank, without recourse to adhesive stamps.

Covers are known, posted at this period, impressed with the old German date-stamp of __DUALA-KAMERUN__, and bearing
the superscription _No stamps available_.

No stocks o German Colonial postage stamps were unearthed here as in Togo, Samoa and New Britain; but by coincidence a large consignement
of all values addressed to the Chief Postmaster of Duala on the eve of the war, eas found
on board the German West African liner, _Professor Woermann_, which had been brought into Freetown, Sierra Leone.
When stamps were required for use under the British Administration in the cameroons, these ex-German __KAMERUN__ stamps were converted into a provisional
occupation issue by means of the initials __C.E.F.__, signifying 
_Camerouns Expeditionary Force_, and new values in British currency superimposed on them at the Government Printing Office, Sierra Leone, in March, 1915. The total face value
of the stamps overprinted was 72,080 marks, the pfenning values being in sheets of 100, and the mark denominations in small sheets of 20.

Most correspondence is from military sources and genuine civilian use of the overprinted stamps is rare; parcels from civilian firms frequently bear a notification to the effect that stamps were not obtainable, 
though it is believed in actual fact that this was not so. {{footnote:2}}

Members of the forces were allowed to buy a limited number of sets only, but this injunction seems to have been _more honoured in the breach than the observance_.

###The British Mandate

After the conclusion of the campaign, a provisional arrangement was made which became effective on April 1st 1916, by
which the territory was divided into two zones. The British portion was roughly the western lesser half, the French assumed responsibility for the more
easterly area.

In 1919 there was a further adjustment of the borders, which was eventually ratified by the Coucil of the League
of Nations and mandatory powers bestowed on Great Britain and France for their respective areas, which in the case of the
latter was delegaated to teh Nigerian administration, of which Colony it now forms a province by enactments
drawn up in 1924.
