# Memel territory (Memelgebiet, Memelland, Klaipeda)

After the Treaty of Versailles, the Memel Territory (Memelland, Klaipėda) was established. Initially German then French and Lithuanian overprinted stamps were used. Memel issued stamps between 1920 and 1923 when is was annexed by [Lithuania](../lithuania/Introduction).

Although the Memel Area stamps are not too difficult to follow the long history of changing and invasions make it difficult to follow. Almost as soon as these overprinted stamps were issued, the forgers went to work, making millions of copies of them, which were quickly sold to unsuspecting stamp collectors throughout Central and Western Europe.

"The Serrane Guide -- Stamp Forgeries of the World to 1926".  Writing in the mid-1920's Fernand Serrane, the French expert in forgeries, basically "blasts" the new Memel Territory in the short, text only, article that is shown in the two scans below!  ( The numbers Serrane refers to are Yvert Tellier Catalog numbers. Serrane wrote: Except for the 1923 issue, Memel has only overprinted sets. Eighteen issues were spawn in four years with the desired varieties and errors of all kinds.

We sometimes have been criticized for advising against certain \textit{new} stamps. The reproach is ud with regards to genuine, unhoarded, new stamps which, like their older counterpart, surely have a place in collections. But such an avalanche of uninteresting overprints---clearly without any interest for the collector---really is excessive. Let the reader judge on his own whether it is not in his true interest to say: "You have manufactured all those varieties, all those inverted overprints, etc., just to make money at my expense. Well, you can keep them!"

### 1923 Klaipeda Issue

On 9 January 1923, three years after the Versailles Treaty had become effective, Lithuania occupied the territory during the Klaipėda Revolt,[4] mainly by militia that had entered the region from Lithuania. France at the same time had started the Occupation of the Ruhr in Germany, and the French administration in Memel did not take any significant counteractive measures against the rebels. On 19 January, the territory was annexed by Lithuania, and the fait accompli was eventually confirmed by the Council of Ambassadors in 1924.

When the Lithuanian Ministry of Transport took over all the affairs of the Memel Post Post the currency was changed to Centu / Centai and Litas / Litai. This is also the current, currency of Lithuania. 

Stamps of the previous issues were surcharged and this provides ample interest and varities for a philatelic collection of Memel.
