##Boer War : Camps in Portugal
###Introduction



After Cronje's surrender at the battle of {{wi:Paardeberg}}, the Boer prisoners were taken to Modder River
where they were put onto trains for Cape Town. On arrival the Commandant-Generaal Cronje was placed temporarily upon the British cruiser \textit{Doris}. Admiral Harris treated the prisoner well and he gave him the flag officer's state cabins. The men were in the prisoner of war camps at Green Point, Cape Town and Belle Vue, Simonstown. Some were placed on ships in Simonstown. As reportedly many attempts were made at escaping it was decided to transfer the prisoners to St. Helena.

The Governor of St.Helena, Robert A. Sterndale, G.M.C., on the 5th April 1900, issued a proclamation announcing the impeding arrival on the island of the Boer prisoners of war.

The first batch of 514 prisoners arrived on board the \ship{S.S.Milwakee} on the 16th April 1900. Amongst the prisoners on board were Commandant-Generaal Cronje, Mrs Cronje and their grandson.
