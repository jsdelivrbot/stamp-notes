A detachment of the Army Postal Corps (which was a permanent service organization since 1882) sailed
for South Africa in October 1899 under the command of Captain G.W. Treble followed later by reinforcements.

A __Base Post Office__ was established first in the cellars of the capetown Post Office with a subordinate
base at Pietermaritzburg, Natal.

From these bases the postal network expanded covering the operational areas which eventually controlled 71
Field (including T.P.O.'s) and Army Post Offices.


Handstamps were issued for Base Offices, Field Post Offices, Stationary Post Offices and Travelling Post Offices on various railway lines. There are some 60 numbered FPOs and several without numbers; APOs for named towns (either circular or octagonal marks); large rubber APO marks; and some unusual Natal Field Force 'corks'.

A comprehensive and detailed list of these with dates of opening, closing and re-opening was given by
S. Rich in his book on the philately of the War. In addition a series of articles published in the
_Philatelic Journal of Great Britain__ (commencing December 1938) provides more details. The latter was the
combined work of a number of authorities.

The Army Post Office was a large organization during the Anglo-Boer War as mailed had reached three quarters of
a million pieces weekly.

On the withdrawal of the Expeditionary Forces the mail of the remaining forces was dealt with by the local
postal organizations.

###Rates

Normal inland postage rates were paid by Service personnel franked with mostly British postage stamps.

###Field Post Office Cancellations

Mail that went through the Army Post Office is easily detected by the use of a F.P.O. cancellation. Initially
these were uniform but war exigenecies produced numerous others of an improverished or permanent
character to meet the day-to-daty requirements, without causing the abolition of tose that preceded them.

The Foces operating from Natal (collectively referred to as the "Natal Field Force") by the postal
administration of this theatre) used the normal F.P.O. network.
