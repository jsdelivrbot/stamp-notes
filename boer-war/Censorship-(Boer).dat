###Censorship by the Boers

The first attempt at postal censorship started immediately with the outbreak of the War. Letters were
opened, examined by the censor and sealed with a label bearing the inscription Geopened Onder de Krijgswet (Opened Under Martial Law).

Later a red sealing label was applied.
