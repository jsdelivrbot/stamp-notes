A fascinating card sent from Grey Town on 30th July 1906 via Pietermaritzburg to London.

The author writes:

My Dearest? I have got on the move at last! I joined the Natal Cavilary we hope to join the main body tomorrow so will write you fully. But do not be anxious if you do not hear every mail as they leave the field very erratically. I have a very good horse so I am pretty comfortable !

History of events:

On 8 February 1906 a Natal Police detachment was attacked after they had arrested three men for participating in an armed gathering. That gathering was a protest against a poll tax which had been imposed on all adult males in the Colony of Natal. Only indentured labourers and those who paid hut tax were exempted. This attack marked the beginning of what is popularly known as the Bhambatha Rebellion. The rebellion has also been called the Natal or Zulu Rebellion. Of these terms, Zulu Rebellion is probably the least appropriate. The bulk of the rebels were not amaZulu and, in fact, were descendants of clansmen who had fled during the formation and expansion of the Zulu Kingdom.

The significance of an historical event lies in its results. Ironically for an event which has been almost forgotten, the Natal Rebellion was momentous in its consequences. It led directly to the formation of the Union of South Africa and the African National Congress. Yet, until recently, it has been largely ignored. At the time, however, two histories were written about it -W Bosman's The Natal Rebellion of 1906and J Stuart's A History of the Zulu Rebellion. Bosman's account was written shortly after the close of the active phase of the rebellion. Stuart's account has often been accepted as an official or semi-official history. (This is most probably based on the fact that the history is dedicated to Sir Henry McCallum who was Governor of Natal at the time of the rebellion). After this initial interest, not including regimental histories, the rebellion was forgotten until the mid-1960s when mention of it resurfaced in Brookes and Webb's A History of Natal. This was followed in 1970 by the publication of Shula Marks's Reluctant Rebellion.

Items are hard to find but mostly not expensive. Not everything from the period can be considered related so be a bit careful of what you pay.
