During the course of the ZAR Government's retreat eastwards from Pretoria on 5 June, an extraordinary
issue of the Government Gazette (No 1121, 7 June 1900, consecutive page 54) was printed
on the State's printing press in the field at Machadadorp. This took place on the gazette's date of issue,
and was done on 1/2 green and a few 1d red and green potscards. The purpose was to inform local and
foreign persons that the seat of the Government had been temporarily moved.

These postcards are said to have been sold by post offices only after
having the datestamp of the appplicable post office impressed on the stamp. In other words, the apparent cancelled-to-order nature of this
issue is probably the equivalent of unused issues of these postcards.

Mathews gives the reason for this pre-issue cancellation as apparently being an attempt to stop forgeries of the card. This
is also the reason why some cards are found with cancellations of two different post offices. As the post office was required to "move along",
the cards were taken to the next one, where they were again cancelled.
