###Background
The Siege of Ladysmith was a protracted engagement in the Second Boer War. 
__It took place between 30 October 1899 and 28 February 1900 at Ladysmith, Natal__.

British commander Lieutenant General Sir George White made Ladysmith his center of operations for the protection of Natal against the Boer forces. Starting on 29 October 1899 a number of short lived battles were fought for control of the town, but after suffering heavy casualties the British forces retreated to Ladysmith and the Boer forces did not make use of the opportunity to follow up the attack and take control of the town.

On February 28 the besieged defenders of Ladysmith observed a great column of Boer horsemen and wagons moving rapidly north, just outside artillery range. Some time after 5:00 pm, two squadrons of British mounted infantry commanded by Major Hubert Gough from Buller's army rode into Ladysmith and ended the siege. Botha retreated to a new defensive line 60 miles to the north.

Both soldier's letters as well as some civilian post exists from march after the relief, going through
the normal civilian posts, probably via Natal to England. With the large relief force and obviously everyone wanting
to communicate with their relatives and friends a shortage of stamps appears to have been experienced. Some
of the letters are known marked _no stamps available_. On arrival they were taxed, but overstruck and delivered free.
