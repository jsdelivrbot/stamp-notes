The first batch of prisoners arrived in Ceylon on 9 August 1900 and subsequently others followed until some 5 000 prisoners had landed. Diyatalawa was the main camp. Mt Lavinia was the convalescent camp while dissidents and irreconcilables were housed at Ragama. A camp for prisoners on parole was also opened at Urugasmanhandiya in September 1901. Hambantota was also a parole camp. Camps were established in India at the following places:

- Abottabad
- Ahmednagar
- Bellary
- Bhim Tal
- Dagshai and Solon
- Fort Govindgarh
- Kaity-Nilgiris
- Satara
- Shahjahanpur
- Sialkot
- Trichinopoly
- Umballa
- Upper Topa


An announcement on May 12, 1900, out of Calcutta, stated that Dijitalwa in Ceylon was being prepared for the reception of six thousand Boer prisoners. Reported by the Evening Post, New Zealand, May 14, 1900.

On May 24, 1900, the Bay of Plenty Times, reported that 250 homeless children were sent to Ceylon where they were attending a Dutch school in Kandy.

On July 25, 1900, the Wanganui Herald headlined the following, 2000 Boer prisoners to be sent to Ceylon.This report appeared in the North Otago Times on November 30, 1900, and gives some insight into conditions and attitudes at the prison camp in Ceylon. The 4000 prisoners in the hill country of Ceylon keep their guards very lively by their attempts to escape or break bonds by quarrels among themselves especially between men of different nationalities and by refractory conduct, leading to imprisonment. The most notable attempt to escape was made by a Frenchman and a Spaniard but within twelve hours they were recaptured. One thousand more prisoners are expected, and then the Ceylon contingent of the Boers will be complete.

The New Zealand Evening Post dated October 2, 1901, reported that, the offer of Boers on parole in Ceylon to serve in the British army outside South Africa has been accepted. A hundred and seventy are being drilled, and will serve in India. However Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½ several Boer prisoners at Ragama Camp in Ceylon, tunnelled 50ft in an attempt to escape. The tunnel was discovered and the men were sent to Welikadde Gaol.

According to the New York Times, February 2, 1902, about 5 000 prisoners were in the camp at Diyatalawa which lies 162 miles from the coast and within about six degrees of the equator. Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½ The Boer prisoners are housed at the camp in buildings constructed of galvanized iron with board floors. They all appear to have a sufficiency of blankets. The grounds were surrounded by two lines of wire fence about eight feet apart with the space between the two fences filled with loose barbed wire. The food of the prisoners is exactly the same as that furnished to the soldiers who guard them. The Boers, however, are permitted to purchase anything in the shape of food that they may desire. The granting of paroles is very general to the Boer prisoners - especially to the officers, as they had money enough to support themselves outside the inclosure. The prisoners were a well behaved lot of men, except the foreign contingent. With them there was, once or twice, a little trouble, so that a separate camp was established for the foreigners. The majority of the 5 000 prisoners seemed to be well fed, well housed, well clothed, and well treated, and the action of the Government in receiving their officers as equals must be very consoling to their national pride.

On April 19, 1902, the Hawera & Normanby Star gave the figures of Boer prisoners in Ceylon who had voluntarily surrendered - and presumably taken an oath of neutrality - 4 585.
