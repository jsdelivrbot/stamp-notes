During the course of the ZAR Government's retreat eastwards from Pretoria on 5 June, an extraordinary
issue of the Government Gazette (No 1121, 7 June 1900, consecutive page 54) was printed
on the State's printing press in the field at Machadadorp. This took place on the gazette's date of issue,
and was done on 1/2 green and a few 1d red and green potscards. The purpose was to inform local and
foreign persons that the seat of the Government had been temporarily moved.

These postcards are said to have been sold by post offices only after
having the datestamp of the appplicable post office impressed on the stamp. In other words, the apparent cancelled-to-order nature of this
issue is probably the equivalent of unused issues of these postcards.

### The Machadodorp Card

On __18 July 1900__ the ZAR's distributor of stamps, H. Henning, asked the then Postmaster-General,
Isaac van Alphen, who was at Nelspruit at that stage, to authorize the printing of approximately 5 000 id
postcards to meet the demands for such items.

This arose out of sharply diminished supplies which followed the printing of the "Proclamation Card". 
The imprinted 1d stamp on this card, was in fact, derived from the Arms found on this card. Van Alphen gave permission
on 27 July 1900. It should be noted, however, that two postally used copies dated 20 July are recorded. that is
6 days earlier. It would therefore appear that printing was done in anticipation of approval.

Mathews writes that:

<blockquote>
These cards are also said to have been sold by the post office in a pre-cancelled form; pristine mint cards appear
to be scarce, and could possibly be remainders. The ZAR Government left Machadodorp for Barbeton on 14 August 1900.
