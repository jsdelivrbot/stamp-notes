##Boer War : Bellevue Camp, Simonstown
This was one of the largest camps and was located in Simonstown. 
The greatest number of men interned in the first nine months is reported to have been 2300. In April 1900 a shortage of water forced the authorities to sent the prisoners away until an alternative source of water was arranged. The camp contained also French and German prisoners. Any sick men were remove to the Palace Barracks Hotel for nursing with many of them dying from either their wounds or from typhoid and other diseases.[Palace Hotel](http://archive.samj.org.za/1999%20VOL%2089%20Jan-Dec/Articles/01%20January/1.18%20HOSPITALS%20IN%20CAPE%20TOWN%20DURING%20THE%20ANGLO-BOER%20WAR.%20J.C.%20De%20Villiers.pdf)
