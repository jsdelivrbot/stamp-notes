###The Camps
Extensive preparations were undertaken by the military garrison in the islands in the Spring of 1901. Brigade Orders, issued from Prospect Garrison in June 1901, disclosed that a Camp Commandant for Prisoners of War had been appointed as far back as the 29th April 1901. The Commandant's headquarters were in operation on the 26th June and two days later the S.S. Armenian dropped anchor in {{wi:Grassy_Bay}}, having on board a large contingent of Boer prisoners under guard of a company from the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, which
was being withdrawn from active service in South Africa.

The prisoners were in the main members of General Cronje's force which had surrendered at Paardeberg in February 1900. As soon as the ships arrived, the Governor issued a proclamation placing certain areas of the Great Sound under Martial Law.

###Prisoners' Mail

####Outgoing Mail

####Incoming Mail

Although one might have expevtd the Hamilton post office to have handled all the mail upon arrival, there seems to be some eveidence, based on the number of envelopes without any local cancellations or backstamps, to suggest the possibility that soem bags of prisoners' mail from South Africa could have been handed over to the R.A.S.C., who the transported them to Ports Island on the regular military ferry.

As the iincoming mail was in most instances already censored in South Africa, the censors were content to make only a random check. Now and again a letter slipped through without any censoring whatsoever.

No comprehensive list of prisoners' names seems to have ever been available. A list of about 600 names was prepared by Colin Benbow who gave up his effort after about 600 names.

###The Censors

Research suggests that four censors were employed at {{wi:Port_Island}} between June 1901 and June 1902.


###Censor Markings 

Four handstamped censor marks have been recorded. There are also a further two sub-types.

No censor seals were used in the islands and where they appear on covers they have been affixed elsewhere.
