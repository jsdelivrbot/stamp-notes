##Papua
If you are aboard a ship on the open sea, the deck you are standing on is the territory of the country under which flag the ship sails. This means, if you write a letter on a ship in international waters, you are able to use the stamps of the country of the ship. Additionally the officer can hand over the mail to the local post office at any port anywhere in the world and the mail will be delivered without additional charge.	
To mark such a special letter as such, Paquebot cancellations are used.
The use of an official mark to denote mail posted at sea was regulated by international agreements at various meetings of the UPU, the Universal Postal Union. The first regulations were drawn up in 1891. The word \textsc{Paquebot} was introduced in 1897 for the very first time.

The clause reads: "The post office which receives correspondence posted on board, provides same with the common datestamp, adding handwritten or by a stamp the word 'Paquebot'."

The word 'Paquebot' was choosen for international use because French was and is up to today the official language used at UPU congress meetings. This special arrangement applies for mail posted at the first port of call in each country being visited. But if the mailing on board occurs during the stay at a port or the ship sails to subsequent ports of that country the letters must be franked with stamps of that country.

Other forms of paquebot marking. \textsc{LOOSE SHIP LETTER} was marked at Melbourne from 1894 to 1930. 'PAQUETE = BOTE' was marked at port Davao, St. Cruz Isles in 1929. 'PACKET-BOAT originated at Honolulu in 1903.
We find 'Posted on Steamer', 'Ship Letter', 'Packet-Letter', 'Piroscafo', 'Paqu', 'Parquet', 'Ship Mail', 'Vapor', 'Paquebot ou Navire', 'Paq.', 'Steamboat', 'Fra Skib', 'Skibsbrjef', 'Schiffsbrief', 'Paquete', etc. etc..

###Packet Boat

The postcard below illustrates the regulations rather well. It bears a Great Britain adhesive stamp, as it was sailing under a British Flag. The sender of the postcard posted it while the ship was on international waters and when the mail was handed over at the seaport post office it was datestamped with \textsc{AUCKLAND/FMB}.
