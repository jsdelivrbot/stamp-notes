1916 commercial cover BNG Development Co imprint on the flap, to Japan with Monocolours 2\halfd + 1d cancelled 'SAMARAI ED/31MAR16/PAPUA', two fine to very fine strikes of the very rare octagonal 'LATE/FEE' h/s (Lee #117B; rated G), Singapore transit and 'KOBE' arrival b/s, minor blemishes. A delightful and highly significant cover. [Lee recorded only three covers with variants of this h/s, two from Samarai and one from Kulumadau (to which we can add one more). The similar Ex Belknap/"Sepik" cover sold for $2530 at the Macray Watson sale of 31/3/1998]
