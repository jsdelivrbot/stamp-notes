"To/Sir Dallas Esqr/James-town" with the letter dated 
"St Helena the 15 of/June 1829", the address panel a 
little soiled which hardly detracts from this extraordinary item. 
[Charles Dallas was Governor from 1828 until 1836. Between 1821 \& 1833 
St Helena was administered by the East India Company. We expect that 
very little mail of any kind - and especially local mail - survives 
in private hands from this period. Auction: 131 - 
Lot number: 1002 \soldd{1500}{1150} }

The contents of the entire are  interesting: 

\begin{quotation}
"...we take the freedom [sic] to present a few {{wi:Amboina}} shells and some 
arms belonging to the inhabitants of the SW coast of New Guinea or 
Papua..." and signed "The Commander and Officers of/the Dutch Sloop of 
war Triton\ldots"
\end{quotation}

The officers of the Dutch sloopwho were returning to Europe after a voyage to 
New Guinea  where they had founded Fort Du Bus on Triton Bay \& declared the area a 
Dutch possession! It is believed this is the earliest postal article 
related to to any part of New Guinea or Papua, and specifically to 
the Dutch presence in New Guinea. The settlement at Fort Dubus was 
abandoned in 1836)]
