\section{Papua}

In 1906, the name of the territory was officially changed from "British New Guinea" to "Papua". The existing stamps of British New Guinea were overprinted with the inscription "Papua" in black. During November of 1906 the first overprinting was carried out at Port Moresby.

\ph[32.5%]{../papua/240347.jpg}{Essays: Upper-Case 'PAPUA.' Handstamp on BNG 1d SG 2 marginal example from the top of the sheet, the handstamp a little doubled, a few tiny surface abrasions, no gum. Sold for $3405 at auction in 2001. [Mr Wood submitted his "rough proof of the surcharged [sic] stamp" on 6/10/1906. Only five stamps from the top of a single 1d sheet were similarly handstamped, one impression being partial only. For many years, four of the essays were known to be held by Tom Belknap in the United States. The re-appearance in 2001 of this fifth example - the last of four illustrated by Croaker at p9 - after it had lain in an anonymous collection for at least 50 years, caused a mini-sensation. Offered with a modern print of the 1950s photo used for Croaker's illustration

Essays with a second smaller handstamp 'Papua.' - with significant doubling - applied below, small fault at upper-left but the upper-right corner that appears to be missing in the Croaker illustration was simply folded under & made its reappearance in the Belknap catalogue, no gum. Unique! Ex Belknap. 

One of the most important "proof" items of Papua. Despite Wood receiving approval for the 'PAPUA.' overprint, he subsequently advised Treasury that he had insufficient type to produce a forme of 30 upper-case overprints. On 24th October, he submitted this, in his words, "very rough proof of a second sample", for which he did have sufficient type. Permission to use what is now known as the Large 'Papua.' overprint was given on the same day. Given that there is only one "essay" for the issued stamps, this should be worth a large premium over the other four 'PAPUA' samples than our estimate would suggest. Offered with the small piece, also illustrated by Croaker, endorsed "Printers/ Proofs/JWood 1906".  Auction: 135 - Lot number: 305 soldaud 6000 11500}

Owning to exhaustion of supplies of the stamps early in 1907, additional quantities were ordered from Brisbane, Queensland. The second printing is quite distinct as the letters of "Papua" are smaller and thinner.
