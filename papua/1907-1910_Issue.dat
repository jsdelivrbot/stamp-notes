##Papua

### 1907-10 Issue

The new permanent issue started to appear in 1907. The lakatoi design was retained, featuring the inscription \textsc{PAPUA} in the upper label. The stamps were lithographed by J.B.Cooke at the Stamp Printing Office, Melbourne. The stones used for the lithographs were prepared from transfers from the engraved plates for the British New Guinea design, but with the name "Papua" inserted separately. The paper was the same like the current issues of Victoria, watermarked with a crown and double-lined A.
The firast stamp was issued in November 1907, followed by others from June 1908 to June 1910.
