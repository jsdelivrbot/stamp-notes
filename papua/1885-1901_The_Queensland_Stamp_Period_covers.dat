### 1885-1901 The Queensland Stamp Period Covers

Very few pre-1891 covers from British New Guinea are recorded. While the date slug is over-inked, we concur with prevailing opinion that it is '22', which makes it the earliest recorded of the very few contemporary strikes. The Granville datestamp has been recorded on only four covers, two of which are included in the Rybak Collection: see also Lot 275.

Unlike most of the early British New Guinea covers this is not from the famous Musgrave Correspondence. The writer was Rev James Chalmers of the London Missionary Society. After 10 years at Rarotonga (1867-77), Chalmers was transferred to British New Guinea, where he served from 1877 until his death in 1901. Recognised as an important explorer of the coastal regions, Chalmers resisted attempts to have him lead expeditions into the interior. He also refused offers to join the civil administration, declaring that his over-riding purpose was to evangelise the native population. 
Chalmers' last permanent home was at Daru, from where he sought to establish a mission station on Goaribari Island. It was here that he was murdered by cannibals on 8/4/1901. Offered with an unused c.1905 LMS postcard of the martyred Chalmers.

In 1877, Chalmers had his desire for pioneering work fulfilled and was sent to New Guinea, then an almost-unknown land. He and his wife arrived at Port Moresby on 22 October 1877. During the next nine years he explored much of southern New Guinea in dangerous conditions, and was everywhere the peacemaker. In 1885, Work and Adventure in New Guinea 1877 to 1885, which he wrote in collaboration with W. Wyatt Gill, was published in London. Next appeared Adventures in New Guinea (1886) and Pioneering in New Guinea (1887) solely by Chalmers. A year's leave in Great Britain (1886-7) generated much interest in his work.

After Chalmers' return to New Guinea, he did a great deal of exploring and gained a detailed knowledge of much of the country and its inhabitants. When British New Guinea was made a colony in 1888, Chalmers and his fellow missionary, the Rev. William G. Lawes, explained to the chiefs the meaning of the functions that were held. It had been decided that the colony should be governed in the best interests of the natives. It was no doubt largely the influence of the missionaries that made it illegal both to deport natives illegal and to introduce intoxicants, fire-arms, and explosives. In 1893, Chalmers explored part of the Fly River in a steam launch, but found the natives extremely hostile. He had another furlough in 1894-5 and did much speaking in Great Britain. He also published Pioneer Life and Work in New Guinea 1877-1894 (1895), which contained a considerable amount of material from earlier books. Back at his work in 1896, Chalmers was anxious to further explore the Fly River and established himself for some time at Saguane off the Fly River delta. His last station was Daru. 

In April 1900 he was joined by a young missionary, the Rev. Oliver F. Tomkins (4th son of Reverend Tomkins, United Reform Church, Princes St Norwich - a plaque is situated in the church to Oliver's memory). A year later, he was on a vessel with Tomkins near Goaribari Island, and was visited by natives who appeared to be in a dangerous mood. Chalmers resolved to go ashore and Tomkins insisted on going with him. Both men were killed on 8 April 1901. There is a stained glass window to their memory in the college chapel at Vatorato.

Chalmers' first wife died on 20 February 1879. In 1888 he married Sarah Elizabeth Harrison, a widow who had been a childhood friend of his first wife. She died in 1900. There were no children by either marriage.
