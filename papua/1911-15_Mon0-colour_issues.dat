### 1911-15 Issue

For reasons of economy the issue of 1911 was to be in one colour. Typical of Government Officials no-one realized that this was going to be unpopular with collectors and that the loss of income from such sales was higher than the savings in printing costs. In 1916 the two colour issues would resume again.
