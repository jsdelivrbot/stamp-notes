### 1901-1905 British New Guinea

Upon the inaugaration of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 postal services for all territories was assumed by the new Federal Government. On 1 July 1901 a separate issue of stamps, was released, prepared for the territory. The stamps were designed, engraved and printed by De La Rue in London using the recess printing process. They featured for the first time, the {{wi:lakatoi}}, the traditional canoe of the potters of Hanuabada. They were printed in sheets of 30 (five by six) in seven denominations. In 1905, a 2/6 value was added to the series. They were printed on on watermarked paper with multiple rosettes. The watermark can be found both in vertical as well as horizontal position. The paper of the first printing was on thick paper whereas the latter was on thinner paper. 

Stanley Gibbons catalogues the set as SG1-8.

### Specimen
\ph[32.5%]{../papua/240334.jpg}{ Watermark Horizontal Thick Paper: 2/6d black & brown SG 8 with small 'SPECIMEN' handstamp (Samuel Type D15, 12 1/2x2mm) in violet at the base, exceptional centring, ungummed. Believed to be the only recorded example and, having been issued four years after the other values, the only value so treated. Ex De La Rue Archives. Marcus Samuel at page 46 states: "This...was used to cancel file copies of stamps of various British controlled territories but rarely those of the Crown Colonies...They are very incomplete because they were taken from an album which was damaged by fire in 1940". soldaud 3000 4600} 

The printing on thin paper are relatively scarce, whilst the 2/6 value on either paper has always been a rare stamp. This is probably accounted for by the fact that, of the total printing of 15,660 of this value, only 2,234 were issued without the "Papua"                                                                                                                                                                       overprint.
