### 1916-32 Bicolors


\ph[80%]{papua/240394.jpg}{ Postal Fiscals: Perf 12 1/2 1d rose-pink overprinted 'Stamp Duty', lower-right 'JBC' Monogram block of 6 (2x3) with the Overprint Misplaced to Top (appearing at the base of the upper four stamps) and Omitted from the Lower Units, resulting in two Overprint/No Overprint pairs (the corner pair being unmounted). A rare and delightful error piece. Ex Evan Gill and Belknap. With RPSofL Certificate (1987). [Evan Gill's complete sheet was split in 1970 by Robson Lowe (Aust). It is worth noting that Colonel Evans' block of 4 with Overprint Double sold for $1980 (2001). This is a far more significant, and visually striking item]
