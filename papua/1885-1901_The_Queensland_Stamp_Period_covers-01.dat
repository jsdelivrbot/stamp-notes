### 1885-1901 The Queensland Stamp Period Covers

A much travelled covered with a number of unique marks is one sent to a Herr Paul Dolch in 1889.

\ph[60%]{../papua/240420-2.jpg}{1889 cover from Meissen in Germany to "Paul Dolch/Kenea Butaritari/Macin [sic] Gilbert Inseln" by an extraordinarily circuitous route via Adelaide (!, GPO cds of AP11/89 on the face), Singapore (OC13/89) & Sydney (!, NO17/89). At least in South Australia, it would seem nobody knew the whereabouts of the Gilbert Islands!! At some point the additional information "Mulgrave Archipel" was added, this being the wider regional name for the islands comprising the Eastern Carolines, the Marshalls & the Gilberts. Presumably on arrival in the Gilberts (for which a British Protectorate was proclaimed only on 27/5/1892, and where there was no post office until 1911!), the address was crossed-out & the cover re-addressed in blue pencil to "British New/Guinea" where it received at Port Moresby a fine but overstruck backstamp of 'GRANVILLE/24DE/89/BNG' cds (Lee #4; rated F).

Herr Dolch was still not found so the cover was forwarded via Cooktown (JA27/90) to the Dutch Indies where it received backstamps of Weltevreden (10/2/1890) & Soerabaja (14/2/1890). Again no joy so it continued on to German New Guinea where a fine 'FINSCHHAFEN/24 4/90/ * ' b/s was added. Still undelivered, it retraced its steps to Weltevreden (superb b/s of 20/6/1890) & on to Singapore (JU23/90). 

Dolch must have been known there because the cover was then returned to British New Guinea, receiving a largely very fine strike of the rare 'PORT MORESBY/SP17/9[0]/NEW GUINEA' b/s (Lee #1; rated F) - this being the only example recorded on cover - and then a very fine & clear 27mm 'SAMARAI/30DEC90/B.N.G' b/s (Lee #24; rated E) directly alongside. Herr Dolch was still eluding the best efforts of the numerous post offices to track him down and, at this point, defeat was accepted. 

The cover bears a variety of instructional handstamps some of which are clearly of Queensland manufacture. A poor 'UNC[LAIMED]' h/s (Lee #104; ERD by 7 years; rated G) and very fine 'RETOUR' h/s (unrecorded by Lee) were both applied to the face, almost certainly at Port Moresby, where the cover then languished for years. 

After almost a decade!! the cover was sent to Brisbane where a faint but legible strike of the 'DEAD LETTER OFFICE/18OC98/BRISBANE' cds was applied in violet on the reverse. The boxed 'NON RECLAME/UNCLAIMED' b/s was probably applied here, though it is unrecorded by Campbell. He also doesn't record the boxed 'REBUT/A L'ORIGINE' h/s on the face but it was also probably applied in Brisbane. 

That the cover was eventually returned to Germany is evidenced by the superb 'MEISSEN/ 10.1.99 1-2N/ 1 a' & very fine 'COLLN/11.1.99/(ELBE)' backstamps, plus the partial 'KAISERL D[EUTSCH]/ 19 / BAHN[POST]' resealing labels that also indicate that our long-suffering cover had by this time, after a decade in the tropics, fallen into a state of disrepair. (Fortunately it has been expertly restored, though this has resulted in some of the manuscript markings, in particular, losing some definition.) Ex Roger Lee: sold for $22,176 (2002). 

Without doubt, this is the most significant and extraordinary Pacific Islands cover we have ever offered. 1) It is the earliest recorded cover to the Gilbert Islands, a destination so remote and poorly regarded that at the time no European country had even claimed it! 2) It is one of the earliest covers into Papua and bears the only example of the 'PORT MORESBY/NEW GUINEA' cds recorded on cover, and the latest of only 4 strikes of the 'GRANVILLE/BNG' cds on cover. 3) It's journey spanned ten years - longer than even mails detained for the duration of either World War - and took in three of the six Australian Colonies, Singapore, and Pacific Colonies of the British, Dutch and Germans!

Paul Dolch really did exist! He was shipwrecked on Butaritari in 1887. He stayed and became the "harbourmaster" (which means he piloted ships within the lagoon). At the time this letter was beginning its epic but fruitless journey, Dolch was himself en route back to Germany where he stayed for at least two years. Apparently he didn't tell anyone in the Gilberts where he was going. After re-marrying, he & his bride returned to Butaritari where they lived until about 1905, at which time they returned permanently to Germany. The cover is offered with Roger Lee's historical notes, a typescript of recollections of Paul Dolch's widow Johanna, and a reproduction of a quirky double-exposure photograph of the Dolchs on both the porch and at the window of their Gilbertese home!
