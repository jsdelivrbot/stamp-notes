 Bay of Islands 21st Feby 1840 to George Clendon/Deal/Kent with two strikes of the stepped \textsc{EASTBOURNE/SHIP LETTER} h/s 
 London b/s of \postmark{18JY18/1840} in red, rated "8" in black for an incoming shipletter, internal splitting and reinforcing. Carried per barque ship Westminster which departed the Bay of Islands 17/3/1840, making a remarkably swift passage of less than 4 months, in an era when voyages of 12 months were commonplace. 

Very few letters from the interim or transitional period between the formal annexation of New Zealand by New South Wales in February 1840 and the opening of the first post office, at , in March 1840 have been recorded. 

The sender was people James Clendon, one of the most prominent early settlers. He settled in the Kororarika (Russell) district in 1832 and in 1838 was appointed United States Consul in New Zealand. 

In 1840 he signed the Treaty of Waitangi as witness to the signatures of several Maori chiefs, and was appointed to New Zealand's first Legislative Council. His property at Okiato was acquired by the new government, but the purchase was only partly-completed and Clendon was compensated with 10,000 acres south of Auckland!! 

This letter was written only two weeks after the original signing on 6th February of the Treaty of Waitangi. In it, Clendon states
quote
...Our adopted land is now a British Colony. Captain Hobson Lieutenant Governor and Staff arrived on the 29th Jany...It has of course raised the value of land and I hope to turn some of mine to good account. I am probably the largest landholder...Almost every fortnight brings an arrival from Sydney with from 50 to 70 Passengers so that our Bay is getting very thickly populated...I consider my land in the Bay of Islands worth at least \pounds10,000 and a tract between this and the Thames...I would not take less than \pounds20,000...

Covers from New Zealand carried per ARMSN - the first steam packet service from Australia - are very scarce. The outwards shipletter rate was halved from 4d to 2d in April 1851. The letter, signed "Wendell [?] 

Draper" states "...the Australian Diggings have drawn from here a large part of the population...Many people who have made small fortunes on the gold field have come here to invest so that eventually the diggings may repay us for all the evil they have hitherto done us in various ways..."}
