These stamps have quite a colorfull history and are reputed to have cost Sir Edward Bacon his contract with
the British Authorities for printing stamps of the United Kingdom and the Colonies. In 1861 a request by a member of the
Rowland Hill family to Bacon for _specimens_ of their stamps, other than those of Great Britain
for their private collections.

In August of that year six copies of every colonial stamp, then available to the printers, were forwarded to Mr. Pearson Hill,
with the request that he would present sets to his father, Sir Rowland Hill, and to Mr. Ormond Hill. In order that
these stamps should not be available for postal use, they were all handstamped with word __CANCELLED__ in a barred oval,
with an obliterator similar to those supplied to the Government of Chile, for the cancellation of their beautiful first
issue stamps, which were produced by this firm. This __CANCELLED__ obliteration is type CP1 in Robson Lowe.

This was an extraordinary example of the creation of __Specimen__ copies by the printers, from stamps which must have been then been Colonial property, 
and authority for the production of which can hardly have been sought from each individual Colony.

Although this was understandable in view of the eminence of the receipients, 
it was by no means the only example.

Some Perkins Bacon issues of the West Indies group are found cancelled with a thick pen-stroke for use as __Specimens__,
or with __Specimen__ as in manuscript, but very few exist overprinted __SPECIMEN__, and those which are known were probably
so overprinted at a date far subsequent to their issue.



These stamps, together with a similar set of stamps from Ceylong belonged to the Collection, which wa srecently 
put at auction. They have very high estimates nad realized even higher figures. Good quality material and this is as good
as it gets. When these stamps are offered at auction, tehy present once in a life time opportunity. They are rarer than the 
most rare of all stamps and greatly undervalued.

There were 75 different stamps from 20 British Colonies that were cancelled by Bacon. They were from all six Australian states, six of the British West Indies, Cape of Good Hope, Ceylon, the Ionian Islands, Mauritius, Natal, Newfoundland, New Zealand, St. Helena, and Chile. Although some of the first issues of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia may exist, no copy has been found. Eight Newfoundland stamps were among the Bacon gift to the Hills - a total of 430 to 450 stamps.

A sound account of the Bacon subterfuge is well documented in _Cancelled By Perkins Bacon_, a slim but significant volume by Peter Jaffe.

Jaffe's text provides 221 color impressions as well as the sources and analysis for all the 234 extant examples. The Royal Philatelic Collection in Great Britain has 67 different Perkins Bacon "CANCELLED" stamps, and, while author Jaffe has 78 of the stamps, many of his are duplicates.

The story holds a great deal of fascination for a crime that began so innocently. The stamps in question are rare items, none of which were available to the public until 1897 when the first collection was sold.

What makes this story so intriguing is the possibility of finding a Perkins Bacon "CANCELLED" item. In the last six years, there have been at least five "CANCELLED" finds. The chances, therefore, of getting one of the Perkins Bacon famous stamps is not mere myth. There are others out there.

Note: One of the aims of this website is to try and 'preserve' some of the great collections that come out in the market, by showing
highlights here and also by extending the story of the stamps. If you know or willing to write such articles, please let
us know.

Peter Jaffe, who has been working on the story of the "CANCELLED" stamps since 1962, lends significance and insight to one of the historic features of philately. Cancelled By Perkins Bacon was published for London's Spink & Son Ltd. by James Bendon (P.O. Box 56484, 3307 Limassol, Cyprus ).
