EASTBOURNE/SHIP LETTER h/s
\& London b/s of 18JY18/1840
in red, rated "8" in black for an incoming shipletter, internal splitting 
and reinforcing. Carried per barque \ship{Westminster} which departed the 
Bay of Islands 17/3/1840, making a remarkably swift passage of less than 
4 months, in an era when voyages of 12 months were commonplace. }

Very few letters from the interim or transitional period between the 
formal annexation of New Zealand by New South Wales in February 1840 
and the opening of the first post office, at \index{Kororarika},
in March 1840 have been recorded. 



The sender was \people{James Clendon}, one of the most prominent 
early settlers. He settled in the Kororarika (Russell) district in 1832
and in 1838 was appointed United States Consul in New Zealand. 

In 1840 he signed the Treaty of Waitangi as witness to the signatures 
of several Maori chiefs, and was appointed to New Zealand's first Legislative 
Council. His property at Okiato was acquired by the new government, 
but the purchase was only partly-completed and Clendon was compensated 
with 10,000 acres south of Auckland!! 

This letter was written only two weeks after the original signing on 
6th February of the Treaty of Waitangi. In it, Clendon states

...Our adopted land is now a British Colony. Captain Hobson Lieutenant 
Governor and Staff arrived on the 29th Jany...It has of course raised 
the value of land and I hope to turn some of mine to good account. 
I am probably the largest landholder...Almost every fortnight brings 
an arrival from Sydney with from 50 to 70 Passengers so that our Bay 
is getting very thickly populated...I consider my land in the Bay of 
Islands worth at least \pounds10,000 and a tract between this and the Thames...
I would not take less than \pounds20,000...
