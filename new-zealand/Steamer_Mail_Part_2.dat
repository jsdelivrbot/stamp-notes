\subsection{Early Mail}

Between August 1854 \& March 1857, the Auckland Provincial Government contracted with the owners of the steamship \ship{William Denny} 
for a monthly service between Auckland and Sydney to connect with the English mails. Between June 1855 and mid-1856 the Black Ball Line and White Star Line alternated twice-monthly clipper sailings between Liverpool \& Sydney. However, the return sailings were uncontracted. Despite being treated as private voyages, the Liverpool packet cds was often applied on arrival.

Ex Michael Burberry (1986), Gerald Ellott \& John Woolfe (Lot 283; acquired for \pound4465). A remarkable and highly important cover. }

[This was the original of the letter, the duplicate of which is the next lot!]

Number 39 in Robin Gwynn's 2005 census of 67 covers and dated pieces from the first year of use of New Zealand stamps. This cover was carried on the only Chalons Period mail-carrying voyage via South America. 



It is illustrated in the Handbook Vol VII at page 62. Only one other such cover is recorded. 

It is possible that this cover, instead of travelling north to Panama along the west coast of South America, was actually carried overland to Buenos Aires. Howat at page 131 of "South American Packets 1808-1880" states that the \ship{Avon} departed Buenos Aires 3/4/1856 \& Rio de Janeiro 15/4/1856, arriving at Southampton 16/5/1856, the day before the London arrival cds. While this is not conclusive evidence, it is highly relevant that Kenton \& Parsons "Early Routings of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company 1842-1879" list no arriving steamer from Panama that fits comfortably with the 17/5/1856 receival on this cover. As they say in the classics: "The thick plottens!"Historical note: on 27/2/2010, the Chilean port of Talcahauno was largely destroyed by a massive earthquake and tsunami.

 1856 (Mar 7) envelope to London "p Seringapatam/direct" (also endorsed \textit{D orig pr Southern Cross via Panama} with London Printing 2d dull blue on Blued Paper SG 2 (insignificant corner crease, otherwise a superb stamp with good to large margins, lifted \& hinged back into place) tied by indistinct cancel of 'WELLINGTON' (b/s), rated "6" in black payable on arrival, London transit \& very fine strike of scarce 'BRISTOL/JU17/1856/ K /=IN=' (Robertson Revisited #S10; ERD). 

A famous cover: Number 46 in Robin Gwynn's 2005 census. It is illustrated by Odenweller at page 27. Holcombe Certificate (1988). This and the previous lot - posted three weeks earlier - represent a remarkable re-uniting of original \& duplicate mailings.

This was a very common commercial practice in an age when shipwrecks were all too frequent. However, it is most unusual for both such items to be found together. Indeed, with the previous item having been discovered only in the 1980s, our vendor is confident that he is the first person to own both of them. While it may seem odd that the original should have been sent via an exotic and unproven route, it must be remembered that during the [Crimean](../crimea/introduction) War mails from Australia, and even more so from New Zealand, were seriously affected by a lack of available ships. The sender doubtless chose to avail himself of the "first ship" opportunity, regardless of the fact that it was sailng eastwards, across the Pacific. Ex Maurice Burrus (Lot 33), Bob Odenweller (private transaction), "Antipodes" (Lot 3151) \& Hackmey II (Lot 2050)}
