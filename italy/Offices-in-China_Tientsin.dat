# Introduction to the Italian Offices in China

## The Tientsin Overprints

Italy, like Germany, did not achieve unification until the late 19th century. To assert its place at the table with the Great Powers, Italy embarked upon an expensive program of colonial acquisition and opened offices in China.

Italian Offices in China stamps are overprinted "PECHINO" for Beijing or "TIENTSIN" for Tianjin and are surcharged in Chinese dollars or cents.

On September 7, 1901, a concession in Tientsin was ceded to Italy by the Qing Dynasty of China. On June 7, 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by an Italian consul. In 1935, the Italian concession had a population of about 6,261, including about 536 foreigners. The Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) stationed some vessels at Tientsin.

During World War II, the Italian concession in Tientsin had a garrison of approximately 600 Italian troops on the side of the Axis. On September 10, 1943, when Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, the concession was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army. Later in 1943, the Italian Social Republic (Repubblica Sociale Italiana, or RSI) formally relinquished the concession to the Wang Jingwei Chinese Government. Like the RSI in Axis-held northern Italy, Wang Jingwei's Japanese-sponsored Chinese government was a puppet state and was not recognized by the Kingdom of Italy, by the Republic of China, or by most nations. The Wang Jingwei Government ended when the Empire of Japan was defeated.

On June 2, 1946, the Kingdom of Italy became the Italian Republic (Repubblica Italiana) and on February 10, 1947, by virtue of the peace treaty with Italy, the Italian concession was formally ceded by Italy to Chiang Kai-shek's Republic of China.
