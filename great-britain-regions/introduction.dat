\chapter{Great Britain Regional Stamp Issues}

Beginning in 1958, regional issues were introduced in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales.[12] While these issues are only sold at post offices in the respective regions, the Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh issues are valid throughout the United Kingdom. 

The Channel Islands (since 1969) and Isle of Man (since 1973) now issue their own stamps which are not valid anywhere else.
