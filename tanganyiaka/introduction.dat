# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Tanganyika


On 12th March 1916 Lieut-General J.C. Smuts, as General Officer Commanding in Chief of the
(British) East African Forces, issued a Proclamation formally establishing martial law throughout the
German territory occupied by those forces. Thus was British jurisdiction first formalised in the East
African mainland south of the boundary of the British East Africa Protectorate (later Kenya), and this
was the inception of what was to become for more than forty years an important British dependency
as Tanganyika Territory. Smuts had assumed supreme command in the previous month, after early
reverses had been inflicted on the British by the German forces commanded by General von LettowVorbeck.

In March 1916 the British had occupied Moshi but it was not until 4th September 1916, after
advancing steadily, that they took Dar es Salaam.
Thus, in contrast to the adjacent British dependencies to the east, north and south (Zanzibar, Kenya,
Uganda, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland), Britain acquired jurisdiction in Tanganyika directly from a
rival European colonial power, initially by force of arms, a conquest subsequently transformed into an
international trust first under the terms of the Mandate system of the League of Nations and later
within the Trusteeship system of the United Nations Organisation. This background certainly affected
the course of British administration in Tanganyika – for example in the residual, continuing influences
of German policy; yet the precise impact of the international supervision of British policy in the
Territory is debatable, for in a number of respects colonial administration in Tanganyika bore a close
resemblance to that in [Uganda](../uganda/Introduction) (a protectorate) and [Kenya](../kenya/Introduction) (from 1920 a colony and protectorate) –
with which neighbouring dependencies Tanganyika was to develop a close association.


The United Republic of Tanzania, formed in 1964 by the union of Tanganyika, which became
independent in 1961, with Zanzibar, has emerged in the second half of the twentieth century as one of
the leading and most influential African states – largely because of the interest and attention aroused
by its unique approach to the universal problems of development. This interest is evoked not by
demonstrable success in economic terms, for Tanzania remains one of the poorest states in Africa by
material standards, but because of a consistent adherence to a "principled" approach to contemporary
problems of government and development, issuing in an original brand of "African socialism",
enunciated with clarity and vigour by President Julius Nyerere1
 which puts "equity before growth" and
gives a distinctive and integrated view to the meaning of "development". 

## First stamps

The first postage stamps of Tanganyika were stamps of the East Africa and Uganda Protectorates overprinted "G.E.A." (for German East Africa), used in 1921 and 1922. These are superficially identical to the last occupation issues of German East Africa, but the presence of the "Crown and Script CA" watermark shows they were issued after the civil administration took over from the military, and are thus properly considered the first 
issues of Tanganyika.

## Later issues 

In 1922, the government issued a series of 19 stamps inscribed "TANGANYIKA", featuring the head of a giraffe, denominated in cents, shillings and pounds (100 cents to a shilling, 20 shillings to a pound), with several colour changes in 1925. The changes were because there were many power changes, with each leader wanting a different color.

This was followed in 1927 by a second series of 16 values in a more conventional design with a profile of King George V and inscribed "MANDATED TERRITORY OF TANGANYIKA".
In 1927, Tanganyika entered the Customs Union of [Kenya](../kenya/Introduction) and [Uganda](../uganda/Introduction), as well as the East African Postal Union. Between 1935 and 1961, stamps of the combined postal administration (East African Posts and Telecommunications Administration) known as "Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika" were in use.

## Independence

Shortly after independence in 1961, the new state of Tanganyika issued a series of commemorative stamps inscribed "TANGANYIKA".

This was followed by a final commemorative issue on December 9, 1962, with four stamps inscribed "JAMHURI YA TANGANYIKA" to commemorate the foundation of the republic.
Tanganyika ceased to exist as a nation in 1964, when it was loosely united with [Zanzibar](../zanzibar/Introduction), to form the nation of [Tanzania](../tanzania/Introduction). Stamps of the combined postal administration remained valid until well after the formation of Tanzania.
