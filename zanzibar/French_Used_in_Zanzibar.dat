The French post offices in Zanzibar were post offices operated by France in Zanzibar from 1894 to 1906, when the United Kingdom took direct control of what had previously been a protectorate. Early issues were French stamps overprinted in the local currency. In 1902 French stamps of the 1900 series were issued with "Zanzibar" as a part of the design, but still overprinted in local currency. Many of the stamps, especially those of 1897 created by printing on stamp margins, are very rare and expensive.

Zanzibar, mainly Pemba Island, was once the world's leading clove producer, but annual clove sales have since plummeted by 80% since the 1970s. Explanations given for this is a fast-moving global market, international competition and a hangover from Tanzania’s failed experiment with socialism in the 1960s and ’70s, when the government controlled clove prices and exports. Zanzibar now ranks a distant third with Indonesia supplying 75% of the world's cloves, compared to Zanzibar's 7%.[5]

Zanzibar exports spices, seaweed and fine raffia. It also has a large fishing and dugout canoe production. Tourism is a major foreign currency earner.

During May and June 2008 Zanzibar suffered a major failure of its electricity system which left the island without mains electricity for nearly a month (May 21 - June 19) and entirely dependent on alternative methods of electricity generation (mainly diesel generators). This led to a serious and ongoing shock to the island's fragile economy (mainly based on international tourism).
