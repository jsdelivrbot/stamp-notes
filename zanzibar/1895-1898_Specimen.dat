\chapter{U.P.U. Specimens}  

 According to Marcus Samuel,  Zanzibar circulated the 1895-96 "Zanzibar" issue and
Provisionals, all without Specimen overprints, on 24 April 1897. As by this time stocks had
become exhausted the stamps for U.P.U. distribution had to be reprinted as for similar issues

1/2a. to 5r. set of fifteen reprinted in 1897 made for the circulation to u.p.u. members,
each handstamped "SPECIMEN" diagonally by a receiving Authority, effectively
confirming the fact that this set comes from the special printing. A very rare and possibly
unique set. photo \pound1,800-2,000.}
