Adhesive stamps began in Newfoundland with the issue on January 1st, 1857 of 9 values form 1d. to 1/-. They were printed by Perkins, Bacon of London, England and the designs represented the Royal Crown and Heraldic Flowers of the United Kingdom.



In 1860 and 1861, further supplies of these were received. The papers range all the way from quite thick in the first issue to thin and almost pelure paper in the 1860-61 shipments. Those on the thin paper sometimes show the papermakers' name "Stacey Wise".\index{Stacey Wise!watermark}

In the original shipment, the 1d. was in sheets of 120, the 5d. in sheets of 40, the 3d. in sheets of 80 and the 2d., 4d., 6d., 6 1/2 d., 8d. and 1/- in sheets of 20. 

The 1d. was for newspapers to Great Britain the 2d. for books and magazines, teh 3d. for inland letters, the 6d. for letter rate to Canada and the U.S.A. The other values were double rate to the United Kingdom from points in the colony outside of St. John's the capital.

\subsection*{1865 The First Decimal Issues}

In 1865 the currency was changed to the decimal system which caused a change in the Postal Act and the issue of a new series of stamps. This consisted of six values, 2c. green, 5c. brown, 10c. black, 12c. red-brown, 13c. orange-yellow and 24c. blue. These were produced by the American Bank Note Company of New York, on thin, hard, yellowish paper. The 2c., 10c., 12c. and 24c. also appeared on thin or medium white wove paper. They were in sheets of 100 and perforated 12.

The Codfish on the 2c. and the Seal on the 5c. were appropriate enough subjects, but the artist's knowledge of natural history was much criticised because of the forelegs on the Seal instead of flippers. The 10c. was the Prince Consort, Queen Victoria was on the 12c. and the 13c. showed a sailing vessel. The 24c. was a full face view of the Queen.\sidenote[1cm]{Test}

With the issue of these new decimal stamps a law was passed making prepayment of postage by the use of postage stamps compulsory.

In 1868, a new value of 1c. was required for postage of circulars and newspapers. The design showed the young Prince of Wales, alter Edward VII. This stamp first appeared in a dull purple.

The 3c. vermillion was issued in 1870 and had a short life. It was changed to blue in 1873. The vermillion is quite scarce in fine condition.

The rouletted issues of 1876-1879 were also done by the AMerican Bank Note Company of New York.

The design of the 1c. purple of 1871 was changed in 1880 to violet-brown and then again in 1887 to various shades of green. At the same time, the 2c. green Codfish was changed to orange.

A change in the newspaper rate in 1887 made a 1/2c. stamp necessry and it was also decided to have a new 10c. stamp at the same time. The new 1/2c. stamp for newspapers was the small stamp with the famous Newfoundland dog, issued first in rose-red shades and later, in November 1894 in black. In 1896 it came back in a more orange shade.

Other colour changes took place in 1894, when new printings were ordered. the 6c. plate was sent on to Ottawa from whence it appeared in a new deep lake shade.

In 1890, a 3c. stamp of an entirely different design was produced by teh British American Bank Note Company of Ottawa, and appeared in numerous shades of slate grey.

In 1896, the 1/2c., 1c., 2c. and 3c. all appeared in brighter colours, with clearer impressions and a yellowish gum.

\end{marginfigure}
Like Canada, newfoundland had an 1897 Jubilee set, but it also commemorated teh 400th Anniversary of teh discovery of teh siland by John Cabot. It became known as the CAbot set and covered quite a range of historical, geographical and topical subjects.

\section{1897 Surcharges}

In October 1897, newfoundland issued its first surcharged stamp. 40,000 of teh 3c. slate grey stamp were surcharged "One cent", on 400 sheets in 3 types.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Short thick letters---32,000.

\item Tall, thin serified letters---6,400. 

\item Gothic letters with no serifs---1,600.

\end{enumerate}

\section{The Royal Portrait Issue 1897-1901}

The first of this issue to appear was teh 1/2c. in August 1897, with the portrait of Prince Edward, later the Duke of Windsor at three years of age. The Queen Victoria 3c. carmine had to be changed to green to comply with the Postal Union regulations and the 2c. orange became vermillion i June 1898, followed by the 5c. blue Duke of York (George V) in June 1899 and finally the 4c. violet, Dutchess of York (Queen MAry in October 1901.

Newfoundland entered the Imperial Penny Postage on Christmas 1898.


\section{2c. Map Stamp of September 1908}

\section{The Guy Issue---August 1910}

The 300th Anniversary of the first atempt at a permanent settlement on the island. The stamps were the first production by White-head. Morris & Co. Ltd., of London, England, and were poorly lithographed.

Outstanding varieties in this issue are the "Nfw" on teh 1c. and the reversed "Z" on teh 6c. The original issue was followed early in 1911 by an engarved issue of the 6c., 8c., 9c., 10c., 12c. and 15c. values, on which teh colours were mcuh deeper, but they still retained the somewhat drab appearance.

\section{King George Coronation}

Eleven values were issued and the set was gain printed by Whitehead, Morris & Co. of London, but it hinted taht Perkins, Bacon & Co. made the dies and plates. One specially interesting stamp was teh 8c. Prince George (the late Duke of Kent) which came in two shades of blue, one quite aniline. the aniline one is the commoner of the two. 

This set continued in use until 1919. During the last year of the war (1918), however, amny stamp troubles occurred on the islad, including an acute shortage of 1c., 2c., and 3c. stamps, so much that starting 24th December 1918, mail requiring these denominations in the City of St. John's was taken in by the clerks at the Post Office and the postage paid over the counter in cash. The small stamps remaining were only used on the mail going abroad. Other domsestic mail on the Island was rubber-stamped for the 1c., 2c. or 3c. values.

\section{The War memorial or Cariboo Set 1919}

there were twelve values in this set, commemorating the Army  and Naval Services in the Great War. on the 1c., 3c., 4c., 6c., 10c., 15c. and 24c. values you will see "Trail of the Cariboo" and below the battles in which Newfoundland soldiers took a great part. On the other values, are the words "Royal Naval Reserve", and under this the motto "Ubique", which is the Latin word for "Everywhere". The designs were made locally and sent to Whitehead, Morris & Co., Ltd, in London for production.

\section{The Provisionals 1920}

\end{marginfigure}
In September 1920, the supply of 2c. and 3c. stamps again run low; in fact the 2c. became exhausted altogether, causing a number of provsisionals to be issued. the 15c. cabot stamp was surcharge "Three Cents". then on September 30th the 30c. Cabot was surcharged "Two Cents". Altogether 50,000 of each were overprinted and as might be expected, there are some major varieties in these.

\section{The Small Scenic Issues 1923-24}

This set consisted of 14 values, 1c. to 24c,, all except the 3c. showing scenic views. The 3c. illustrated the War Memorial at St. John's. They were printed by Whitehead, Morris and Co. Ltd from engraved steel plates. During August 1929 the Post Office again ran short of 3 cent stamps and the 6c. grey-black of the 1923 set was surcharged "Three Cents" in red.

\section{The First Labrador Set January 1928}

Due to the Privy Council having granted Newfoundland's claim to territories in Quebec, whic greatly enlarged Newfoundland Territory it was decided to show pictures of places in Labrdor, as well as on the Island. The 1c. shows a map of both the Island and the Mainland.

\section{The Re-engraved Set 1929-1931}

Between 1929 an 1931, the Labrador issue was re-engraved. John Dickinson & Co., of London, secured the contract. The previous printers, Whitehead, Morris & Co., refused to hand over the dies and printing plates, making new ones necessary. 

\section{The Watermarked Issue 1931}

In January 1627, KIng Charles I granted, by Letters Patent, a Coat-of-Arms to Newfoundland, and it was decided to use paper with the watermark reproducing the coat-of-arms for the 1931 Labrador re-issue consisting of eleven values, 1c., 2c., 3c., 4c., 5c., 6c., 8c., 10c., 15c., 20c. and 30c.

\section{The Pictorial Issue 1932}

With the renewal of the Dickinson contract, this new set was prepared and issued on January 1st, 1932. It ahd twelve values, including the 25c. stamp, a new denomination. As before, they were engraved and printed by Perkins Bacon & Co., for the contractors, John Dickinson & Co.

Colour changes took place between 1932 and 1938 due to changes in postal rates and a new 7c. denomination appeared showing the Duchess of York, later Queen Elizabeth and the Queen mother. A new 48c. value also appeared on January in 1938.

The change in posal artes caused an acute shoratge of 15c stamps and the 15c large Airmal stamp was overprinted "L & S. Post" (Land & Sea). The words "Air Mail" were obliterated by two parallel lines.

\section{The Sir Humphrey Gilbert Issue 1933}

Sir Humphrey Gilbert formally annexed Newfoundland to the Crown in 1583 and the 250th Anniversary of annexation was celebrated widely, including the issue of 14 stamps, 1c. to 32c., showing a variety of designs and portraits. The stamps were again engraved and printed by Perkins, Bacon & Co., for John Dickinson & Co.

\section{The King George V Silver Jubilee Issue 1935}

In 1933, Newfoundland reverted to the status of a Crown Colony due to the effects of a long drawn out depression, hence the use of the regular Crown Colony Jubilee issue. The four stamps were the 4c., 5c., 7c., and 24c. There were two printings the second one a bit paler in colour.

\section{Coronation of King George VI 1937}

The three values, 2c., 4c., and 5c., were also the regular Crown Agents' design, but the Newfoundland Government supplemented these with another set of 11 additional values, again produced by perkins Bacon & Co. In this issue, a number of plate varieties exist and the perforations are somewhat mixed. Two well-known varieties are the 1c. with tongue in the month of the fish and the 7c. blue exists with strong doubling on the right side of the circle containing the portrait. 

The Royal Visit issue commemorating the visit of teh reigning monarch was issued on June 17th, 1939 showing the portraits of George VI and Queen Elizabeth in a 5c. blue. This stamp was withdrawn July 31st, 1939. It was engaved and printed by Branbury, Wilkinson & Co. London.

In November 1939, it was found that stock of the 2c. and 4c. values were nearly exhausted due to the war and U-boat action, and the remaining 250,000 Royal Visit stamps were surcharged 2c. and 4c. respectively. They were placed on sale on November 20th. 1939, but the 2c. surcharge was sold out on December 13th and the 4c. on December 16th.

The 5c. Grenfell Commemorative followed on December 1st, 1941, being the 50th Anniversary of the Grenfell Mission. This stamp was printed by the Canadian Bank Note Company, in Ottawa.

In October 1941, five of the recent issues, appeared with designs redrawn along with a new 30c. stamp showing Memorial College, St. John's. The 30c.stamp was unwatermarked.


Due to another shortage of 2c. stamps, this 30c. was surcharged accordingly.
