First Newfoundland Stamps Go on Sale

Although Newfoundland was scheduled to take over the management of its own Post Office on 15 October 1851, it did not do so until 5 April 1852, following the approval of Queen Victoria and the Privy Council on 15 March.

Stamps for Newfoundland were proposed as early as 1851 but were delayed until 1857 because of many political manoeuvres by the colonial Legislature and the refusal of the Privy Council to approve the postal acts passed by the Newfoundland Legislature. Other delays were encountered by what seems to have been confusion on the part of the Postmaster General, William Solomon, as to whom to address in London for the purchase of stamps. Finally, arrangements were made with Perkins, Bacon & Petch in London to produce the stamps.

Two of Newfoundland’s stamps are similar to those of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Newfoundland became the first British North American postal entity to issue triangular stamps and was the only colony to issue stamps for each of its major postal rates.

The first stamps of Newfoundland were in denominations of one to six pence, six-and-a-half pence, eight pence, and one shilling. The dies were prepared in July and September 1856 and the plates were laid from the 15th to the 24th of September 1856. Stamps were printed on 27 September, then packaged and sent to Newfoundland where they arrived in late November. They went on sale on 1 January 1857.
