\chapter{1932-38 Issues The First Resources Issue}



The third issue to appear since the onset of the Depression was the “First Resources” issue of 1932. The
same firm responsible for printing the issues of 1929 and 1931 supplied this new set of twelve different
engraved stamps on paper watermarked with the official coat of arms. The designs portray members of the royal
family, picturesque scenes, economic activity, and natural resources, including those of particular interest to
foreign sportsmen. All the stamps were released on either January 02 or August 15, 1932, except for the 48¢
stamp released on January 05, 1938. The 1¢—5¢ values were printed in 400 subject sheets (Walsh, 1990: 8-10).
1¢. “Codfish ‘Newfoundland Currency’.” Although described by Albert Perlin as “possibly the ugliest stamp
Newfoundland had ever issued” (1959:128), the stamp realistically portrays a catch of fresh cod. The
caption could be a painful reminder to inshore fishermen that they were rarely if every paid in cash by
fish merchants and therefore had to pay their debts literally in ‘fish’ (the generic term that applied
specifically to cod). The photo credited to Holloway can be found in McGrath, (1911:128).
2¢. A portrait in profile of King George V in dress uniform.
3¢. A portrait of Queen Mary wearing a tiara and necklaces.
4¢. A portrait of the Prince of Wales in dress uniform (later King Edward VIII and Duke of Windsor).
5¢. “Caribou ‘Monarch of the Wilds’.” Based on a statue in Bowering Park in St. John's, a caribou stag is
portrayed in profile standing on the barrens as if he was trying to catch a scent from the wind.
6¢. From a photograph of “H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth of York” at age six years (later Queen Elizabeth II),
holding a teddy bear. This was the first likeness of the Princess on any postage stamp. Robson Lowe,
the philatelist, says “this was for some years one of the most popular stamps in the world” (1973:514).
7¢. A portrait of “H.R.H. The Duchess of York” (later Queen Elizabeth and then the Queen Mother).
8¢. “Corner Brook Paper Mills.” An aerial view is provided of the large pulp and paper mill situated on
the Humber Arm.
10¢. “Salmon ‘King of the Rivers’.” An Atlantic salmon is poised midair attempting to leap a waterfall.
The Newfoundland Tourist Development Board photos taken by J. C. Parsons, Corner Brook.
14¢. “Newfoundland Dog.” A pedigreed champion served as the design model (Boggs, 1942:110).
15¢. “Northern Seal ‘Baby Whitecoat’.” A whitecoat is depicted lying on ice. Historically, the seal fishery
was one of Newfoundland's most important industries.
20¢. “Cape Race, ‘Transatlantic Beacon’.” Located at the extreme southeast corner of the Island closest to
the transatlantic shipping lanes, Cape Race served as the chief landmark for ships' navigators crossing
the Atlantic on sailing ships. For this reason and the frequent shipwrecks in the area a lighthouse was
constructed by the British Government in 1856. Members of the Myrick Family have served as keepers
since 1874 (ENL, I:333-334). The design may have been based on a photo by R. E. Holloway
(see Views in Newfoundland “Englands Oldest Colony”).
24¢. “Loading Iron Ore, Bell Island.” A view from Conception Bay of the S.S. Willemsplein at a large pier
at Bell Island loading iron ore. The tremendous iron ore deposits at Bell Island were mined between
1894 and 1966 (ENL, I:167-169). The S.S. Willemsplein was wrecked at Shag Rocks near Peter's River,
S.M.B. (St. Mary’s Bay), in 1945.
25¢. “Sealing Fleet ‘Off For The Hunt’.” Eight steamers are depicted sailing through the narrows. The
departure of the fleet of large vessels from St. John's Harbour each February or March was a major event.
Vessels were sometimes destroyed by the arctic ice pack they worked amongst in search of seals.
30¢. & 48¢. “Leaving For The Banks.” Ten two-masted schooners in full sail are also depicted sailing through
the Narrows. Since their crews fished offshore on the Grand Banks the vessels were called ‘bankers’.
Historically, some storms were famous for having caused the deaths of hundreds of fishermen.
