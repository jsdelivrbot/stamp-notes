### 1919 Trail of Caribou

The Caribou issue was released on January 02, 1919 in the aftermath of World War I. Planning for the issue
in 1918 took account of a stamp shortage and the government's desire to make a patriotic gesture. Hence the
issue commemorated the achievements of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and the thousands of other
Newfoundlanders who served in the British Navy and other branches of the service.
The series is comprised of twelve values from one to thirty-six cents and all share a common, basic design. Based
on a composite design derived from sketches submitted by J.H. Noonan, a Customs official in St. John's, the center
piece is an animal's head facing left that has the features of a caribou combined with a moose's antlers. The caribou
had already been chosen in 1914 as the badge of the Newfoundland Regiment (Huber, 1922:37; Boggs, 1942:91).
Below the “caribou” on four stamps in the series is a ribbon entwining two sprays of oak lettered "Royal -
Naval - Reserve" and on the remainder “Trail of the Caribou”, a phrase proposed by Lt. Col. Thomas Nangle,
the Roman Catholic chaplain of the Newfoundland Regiment (Lowe, 1973:489). Below the ribbon appears the
name of one of the engagements in which Newfoundland forces had distinguished themselves or simply the
Latin word Ubique (“Everywhere”). Except for Suvla Bay near Gallipoli, all the engagements were in France.\footnote{Professor Thomas F. Nemec History of Newoundland stamps}
