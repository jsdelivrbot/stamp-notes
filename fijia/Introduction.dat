FIRST STAMPS ISSUED 1 January 1893. CURRENCY

###Pre-1952, Italian.

###Post-1952, Ethiopian. 

Territorial acquisitions by the Italians from 1869 around 
Assab and Massawa were consolidated by Ethiopian recognition in 1889 and 
the colony of Eritrea was proclaimed on 1 January 1890. 
It became part of Italian East Africa in 1936-41. 

Eritrea was occupied by British forces in 1941 and administered by the British until it was federated with Ethiopia on 15 September 1952 (fully integrated ten years later). It still has a strong separatist movement. 	  	

Stamps in use in 1936 were equally valid throughout Italian East Africa and can be found used in Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland.

###Used stamps of Italian East Africa in 1938-41.

- British Occupation of Eritrea (1941-52)
- Used stamps of Britain overprinted M.E.F. 2 March 1942.
- Used stamps of Britain overprinted B.M.A. ERITREA in 1948-50.
- Used stamps of Britain overprinted B.A. ERITREA 6 February 1950-14 September 1952.
- Since federation in 1952 has used stamps of Ethiopia.

Stamps inscribed ERITREA purporting to come from 'areas liberated from Ethiopia' have been on the market in 1978 (mainly in Switzerland): it is not clear whether they are bogus, propagandist, or were prepared in hope of use. Evidence suggests that any mail from areas of Eritrea not under Ethiopian postal control is sent unstamped by unofficial runner into Sudan and posted there.

During the Federation with Ethiopia, Eritrea retained a high degree of political autonomy. The Ethiopian Emperor, Haile Selassie incorporated Eritrea in 1962 and an armed campaign for independence began in the 1970s, first against Haile Selassie and later against the Communist regime of Mengistu. In May 1991, the Mengistu government was overthrown by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) and the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). In July 1991 the new EPRDF Government agreed to referendum on Eritrean independence. This wass held in April 1993 and recorded a vote of 99% in favour of secession from Ethiopia. Independence was declared on 24 May 1993. 

STAMPS ISSUED ON INDEPENDENCE.
