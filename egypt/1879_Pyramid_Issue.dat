\chapter{1879 Pyramid Issue}

The Fourth Issue of the Egyptian stamps began with a change from the Italian/Arabic of the inscriptions to French/Arabic.

Third unified Sphinx and Pyramid design. Usually known as the De La Rues (printed in London). 

This design had a long life it it can be divided in four periods:

\begin{description}
\item[First Period] 1879-1883, characterized by the initial colours and currency.
\item [Second Period], 1884-1888, characterized by a change to the color scheme recommended by the UPU.
\item [Third Period], 1888-1902, beginning with replacement of currency in paras by milliemes and the itroduction of a new printing plate.
\item [Fourth Period] 1902-1915, marked by conversion to chalk-surfaced paper and of a third type of printing plate.
\end{description}


Seven values: 5pa, 10pa, 20pa, 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p. Some stamps experienced changes in colour.

###De La Rue has Postes Egyptiennes at the top

In 1879 the design of the definitive postage stamps was changed again to incorporate the words in French 'Postes Egyptiennes' to reflect the take-over of postal operations by the Egyptian posts. Notice the arabic inscription at the bottom. In the next issue this is to be moved to the top. This design was printed much more clearly as it was done in Britain by De La Rue. 
The selection of De La Rue was not surprising given the poor printing by Penasson.
