##1879 Pyramid Issue

Third unified Sphinx and Pyramid design. Usually known as the De La Rues (printed in London). 
Seven values: 5pa, 10pa, 20pa, 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p. Some stamps experienced changes in colour.

###De La Rue has Postes Egyptiennes at the top

In 1879 the design of the definitive postage stamps was changed again to incorporate the words in French 'Postes Egyptiennes' to reflect the take-over of postal operations by the Egyptian posts. Notice the arabic inscription at the bottom. In the next issue this is to be moved to the top. This design was printed much more clearly as it was done in Britain by De La Rue. 
The selection of De La Rue was not surprising given the poor printing by Penasson.
