\section{International Geographical Congress}

The Commemorative stamps were issued between the 1st-30th April 1925. They were printed by Offset-litho by the Survey Department of Cairo.

There were two distinct printings of the 10m and teh 15m differing only in shade, which is distinctly printed in a deeper colour on the second printing. There are also differences in the gum. On the first one it is white and smooth, while on the second printing it is yellowish and wavy in diagonal parallel lines.

A commemorative 1st Day Obliteration was also manufactured and used to stamp First day Covers during the event.

The stamps also can be found as imperforates (which according to the Zeheri catalogue) they were issued in error.
