\chapter{The Fourth Issue}




With the Fourth Issue there was a change from the Arabic/Italian inscriptions of the issue to French/Arabic and subsequently to English Arabc in 1914, after a life of 34 years. It is also characterized by a marked improvement in printing techniques moving away from the rather primitive techniques employed in the earlier issues.

The issue straddled the centuries and saw a major expansion and innovation in the Egyptian postal service, as well as three military campaigns having philatelic consequences.

The issue can be divided into four periods:

\begin{description}
\item[First Period 1879-1883], distinguished by the initial colours and currency.

\item [Second Period 1884-1888] characterized by a change of colours to those recommended by the UPU.

\item[Third Period 1888-1902] beginning with a replacement of currency in paras by milliemes and the introduction of a new style printing plate.

\item [Fourth Period 1902-1915], marked by a conversion to chalk-surfaced paper and teh introduction of a third style of printing plate.

\section{Proofs}

The process adopted by De La Rue, was typography. De La Rue engraved the dies, made the plates, and ordered the gummed, watermark paper, in addition to designing and printing the stamps. A master vignette die was made for the initial issue and six transfers from it were made into soft steel hubs upon which the frames for the six denominations were then engraved. 

Die proofs in black on glazed card exist for all values; the earliest is dated November 1878. Many of them are handstamped BEFORE HARDENING, AFTER HARDENING, BEFORE STRIKING, or AFTER STRIKING. These proofs were a way of monitoring the condition of the dies during their history of manufacture and use.

\subsection{Date of Issue}

The new stamps were announced by a multilingual notice,  of which the English version read as follows:

\begin{letter}
The General Post Direction has the honour to inform the public that the postage stamps at present in use will be replaced by postage stamps of a new design, which will be put into circulation the 1st April, 1879.

The postage stamps at present in use will continue to serve either by themselves or in conjuction with those of the new issue for the franking of correspondence until the 31st of October next. From that date they cease to be accepted for any postal matter whatsoever.

From the 31st October to the 31st December 1879, all post offices are authorized to exchange the present postage stamps against others of equal value of the new issue. After that time they will not be accepted at all.
\end{letter}



  
\section{Quantities}  

The invoiced totals, based on the De La Rue archives appear to be as shown in the Table below (as reported by Smith).


The figures do not include undisclosed quantities found in teh De La Rue archives, amounting to at least one sheet (240 stamps) each, and for most, more that one sheet. Consequntly to these remainders being put on the market, unmounted mint examples and multiples are widely available.

\section{Uses}

There were no changes in rates during this period so teh uses of the several values are the same as for the Third Issue, with one exception. Parcel post service, utilizing parcel cards (dispatch notes), came into use with this issue; very few have survived from the period, but they usually bear high values, especially the 5pi.

The 5pi. was intended to pay the rate for domestic periodicals (principally newspapers). Although it was used by the millions, old newspapers, amd especially their wrappers, were not ususally saved, and teh 5pa. is consequently a rarity used alone for this rate. It can be found in multiples or in combination with other values to make up higher rates (a block of 8 would make the letter rate for 1pi.), but even such uses are extremely scarce.

\end{figure}

The rate for the non-periodical printed matter was 10 paras; the most frequently seen example is on unsealed envelopes containing greeting cards. The short lives of the several colours of the 10 paras stamps contribute to making them extremely scarce on cover, whether used alone or with other stamps to make up the letter rate.

\end{figure}  
 
The 20pa. value is scarce on cover also, and is found mostly in pairs to pay the letter rate; singles used alone for the (\textit{en ville} ) letter rate are surprisingly scarce. Although 20pa. was the rate for postal cards, teh adhesive stamp of this denomination was not intended for such use. Only the imprinted postal cards (20pa. brown of 1879) were allowed and privately printed postcards were not accepted.

The 1pi. and 2pi. are the commonest values on cover, the former paying the internal and foreign letter rates and the latter paying the combined letter and registration fee. The 5pi. on any sort of cover is a rarity; it was used principally for parcels, although it could also be used for very heavy insured letters.
