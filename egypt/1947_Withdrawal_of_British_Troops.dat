##1947 Withdrawal of British Troops


With the end of the war, resentment about the British presence in Egypt manifested itself.  In late December 1945, rioting broke out, escalating through to a peak in February 1946 with violent attacks on British Service Clubs and other Military locations in Cairo.

On the 25 January major rioting took place in Ismailia, which was put down by the Lancashire Fusiliers.  The next day, rioters attacked British property in Cairo, The Turf Club was torched, with eleven members dying in the attack.  The GOC 1 Infantry Division, Major General F. R. G. MATTHEWS, prepared a force consisting of the 2 Infantry Brigade and 16 Parachute Brigade to advance along the Suez Road to restore the situation, however, King Farouk took control and order was restored.  During the ‘disturbances’, the 3 Infantry Brigade lost thirty-three killed and sixty-nine wounded.

In May 1946, plans were announced for the withdrawal of British Troops from Egypt into the Canal Zone.  The H.Q. B.T.E. was moved from Cairo to Moascar, a suburb of Ismailia in the Canal Zone.  Disputes between the United Kingdom and Egypt over The Sudan led to negotiations collapsing, but the British withdrawal continued.  On the 9 February 1947, the 2 Bn. The Royal Fusiliers handed over Mustapha Barracks in Alexandria to the Egyptians.  On the 28 March, The Life Guards left Kasr-el-Nil Barracks and withdrew into the Canal Zone.  The Canal Zone was divided into two Brigade Areas, the northern formed by the 3 Infantry Brigade, which also was designated the Strategic Reserve.
