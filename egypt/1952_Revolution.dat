##1952 Revolution of 23 July

The Egyptian Revolution of 1952  by the Free Officers Movement, a group of army officers led by Muhammad Naguib and {{wi: Gamal Abdel Nasser}}. The revolution was initially aimed at overthrowing King Farouk. However, the movement had more political ambitions, and soon moved to abolish the constitutional monarchy and aristocracy of Egypt and Sudan, establish a republic, end the British occupation of the country, and secure the independence of Sudan (hitherto governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium). The revolutionary government adopted a staunchly nationalist, anti-imperialist agenda, which came to be expressed chiefly through Arab nationalism, and international non-alignment.
