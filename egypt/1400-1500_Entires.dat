##Early Letters

Egypt Collectors are fortunate that there is a reasonably large amount of early mail that occasionally comes on the market. The Delta Collection, auctioned by Daniel F. Kelleher Auctions on December 14, 2011 included a number of these early letters. They present an interesting aspect on the Eastern Mediterranean traders of the time. Unlike other postal history periods in Egypt, these letters mostly talk of trade.
