\chapter{Early Letters}

Egypt Collectors are fortunate that there is a reasonably large amount of early mail that occasionally comes on the market. The Delta Collection, auctioned by Daniel F. Kelleher Auctions on December 14, 2011 included a number of these early letters. They present an interesting aspect on the Eastern Mediterranean traders of the time. Unlike other postal history periods in Egypt, these letters mostly talk of trade.

The Venetian posts operated to and from Egypt as well as occassionally within it from the late 14th century top the early 16th. The Venetians had a fleet of approximately 3300 ships in 1405 which served posts all over the eastern Meditteranean, including Alexandria.

A description of the Venetian service is given in ana article, "La Poste M\'edi\'eval en Terre Sainte" by Tolkowsky. Apparently the service to Alexandria was monthly. In the 16th century the journey took from 17 to 90 days (avergae, 52 days). The cost was very high and could amount to more than one month's earnings.

Little was known about the Venetian post until some archive letters began to appear on the market from the 1950s.

The earlier letters are characteristically written in cramped, ungraceful hand, and even the addresses are difficult to decipher. The addresses normally begin with an honorific such as honourable, respectable, noble etc., and teh destination is normally found near the bottom. There is sometimes a notation of the date of arrival; the date of dispatch must be presumed from the date at the head of the letter.

The letters are written in the Venetian dialect of Italian, using many cryptic abbreviations and are very difficult to decipher.

It is important to bear in mind that the Gregorian calendar was introduced in March 1582 only in the Roman Catholic countries of western Europe (in England not until 1750). Letters between Egypt and venice in 1582 and for sometime afterwards might be dated inside by oone calendar, but be docketed outside by the other calendar (the Gregorian calendar was ten days later than the Julian).

By the 18th century, the Venetian post had waned, handwriting had improved marketdly, and addresses are relatively easy to read.

There were no handstamped markings of any kind used on letters to or from Egypt before 1798. Monograms or guild signs, handwritten, are found on some letters. Most letters were sealed with a wax wafer, to which a piece of string was affixed. The paper itself was generally of high quality, 100\% cotton fiber, and has survived teh centuries remarkably well. There are many letters from the era and are moderately rare.
