##Posta Europea

The first postal system of Egypt was organized by an Italian, Pietro Michele Meratti (wrongly identified for many years as Carlo), in 1821, and the early marks are all
inscribed in Italian.

In 1847 this Italian service was called <strong>POSTA EUROPEA</strong> and types [1] to [4], show examples of these.

In 1856, the Posta Europea and the Egyptian State Railways administration signed a five year agreement
by which the transfer of mail from Cairo to Alexandia and vice-versa was to be exclusively carried out by the Posta europea for an annual fee
of 72,000 piastres (18,000 francs). On March 1862, Viceroy Mohammed said Pasha, then the ruler, issued an order by which the 
agreement became the nation's official postal service for ten years, giving the Posta Europea the right to use
all railway routes in Egypt free of charge in return for free carriage of all mails.

In 1857, though a private enterprise, it received Government sanction to carry on qll inland postal services. The italian concession was
purchased by the Government on january 1st 1865 which then took control of the country's postal service under the title
'POSTE VICE-REALLI EGIZIAN". Type 5 date-stamp showws the change in control.

beginning in about 1828, an Italian, Pietro Michele Meratti (wrongly identified until now as Carlo Meratti), 
founded an establishment called LA POSTA EUROPEA. He initiated the first regular service between 
Alexandria and Cairo: the embryo of a larger, more regular and more efficient network in the Delta which gained the confidence of the public, and left the Government's Post on "the dark side of the moon". With the demise of Meratti in 1842), the company acquired the collaboration of another Italian, a man of great organisational capacities and initiative, Giacomo Muzzi, who eventually won from the Pasha in 1862 (an heir of Mohammed Ali, Said), 
a real monopoly for the conveyance of the correspondences in Lower Egypt.

Meratti was a printer for home Leghorn, under the protection of the duke of Tuscany 
that allows him to work on top of Egyptian laws, 
Meratti inaugurates Cairo is the first-Alesandria, about 200 km, which quickly expanded to all 
'Egypt, with a regular and very efficient, so as to relegate to the background all other postal services at the time, including the "corporation" government.
Fu anche grazie a lui ed ad altri italiani molto attivi nella zona che la lingua italiana fu dichiarata "lingua franca", per questo motivo potete trovare documenti dell'epoca con diciture in lingua italiana, compresi i primi francobolli ufficiali del governo egiziano, stampati fra l'altro in Italia dai fratelli Pellas e da De La Rue. It was also thanks to him and to other Italians very active in the area that the Italian was declared "lingua franca", which is why you can find documents with phrases in English, including the first official stamps of the Egyptian government, 
printed between the other in Italy by the brothers Pellas and De La Rue.

##1864 Take Over of Posta Europea by the Egyptian Postal Administration

A man with a good eye for business, Ismail Pasha decided to buy the by now immensely profitable Posta Europea whatever the price. The deal was put into effect at a cost of 950,000 francs on 29th October 1864. The condition was that Muzzi Bey remained to run it. Muzzi Bey was nominated as general manager of the
new Egyptian Government postal administration.
