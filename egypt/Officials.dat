\chapter{The Official Stamps of Egypt}

The official stamps of Egypt are unusually interesting. Many collectors do not realize that Egypt had official stamps long before it issued its own postage stamps. As eearly as 1865 Egyptian officials used round adhesives, commonly referred to as Interpostal Seals. These were generally affixed to the flap of the envelope in which offcial correspondence was mailed so tthey served both as a frank and as a seal. The Interpostal Seals were in use continuously between 1865 and 1892, primarily because there are too many varieties.

Ernest A. Kehr who wrote a book on the Interpostal Seals postulated that the seals became so cumbersome to use and that this led directly to the issuing of the first "Official Stamps." 

In 1892 the following notice was posted in various Egyptian Post Offices:

\begin{letter}
The public is hereby informed that the special postage stamps, which from January first, will be used exclusively for official correspondence, will be on sale at the Alexandria and Cairo Post Offices on and after the 5th proxo. Price 1 P.T. each stamp.

\closing{Alexandria, 30th December, 1892.}

\end{letter}

The peculiarity of these stamps is that theyhad no face value: it was intended that a single copy would be used to frank any one piece of official correspondence, regardless of size and weight. Under the circumstances postmarked pairs, strips and blocks, legitimately used should not exist. 

The design resembles the 1889 postage due series in layout.
