##Egypt: Stamps and Postal History
###1926 12th Agricultural & Industrial Exhibition
In April 1926, the Survey Department, a government agency in Cairo, took over the printing of 
Egyptian stamps. One sheet of each stamp printed by the Survey Department, not those printed out 
of the country or overprints, was sent to the Royal Collection starting with the 12th
 Agricultural and 
Industrial Exposition Issue in 1926 up to and including the stamp celebrating the Birth of Crown 
Prince Ahmed Fuad in 1952.   
The Royal Imperforate Printings were printed on stout, unwatermarked, ungummed paper and were 
not perforated.  On the reverse of each sheet was diagonally printed cancelled in English. On later 
issues, starting in 1947, the printing on the reverse was changed to Arabic by King Farouk. 
The Royal Imperforate sheets were confiscated with the rest of the Royal Collection, by the Republic 
of Egypt when King Farouk was deposed.  The Palace Collections of Egypt were auctioned off at the 
Koubbeh Palace, Cairo on February 12 - 15, 1954 by H. R. Harmer of London

This set of six values was issued in 1926 to celebrate the 12th Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition that took place in Cairo. See [postal museum guide](http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/findingguides/Egypt_Finding_Guide.pdf)

The paper used for these 'cancelled' stamps was not treated very well and impressions of 'cancelled' can be found on the actual face of the stamps. Most amazing there is one full imprint on one of the stamps illustrated on the above set as shown below:

 After the royal collections were sold, George L. Lee (left) acquired some of the imperforate stamps and researched their origins. His writings provided philatelists with reliable information about these stamps for the first time. In 1961, he gave his collection of royal imperforates (approximately 10% of all the copies in existence) to the National Philatelic Collection. Now this is very interesting in that it makes these stamps even more scarce, as every time you read only 100 copies printed, there are less than 90 sets available. It is quite possible that others also belong to postal museums. They are really scare stamps and under valued.
