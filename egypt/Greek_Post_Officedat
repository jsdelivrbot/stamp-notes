VERY RARE GREECE/EGYPT COMBINATION COVER FROM SINAI TO GREECE; Remarkable 8th Apr. 1874 env. (opening faults at top and opened out for display, but with a fine red wax seal of St. Catherine's Monastery at Sinai, where there was no P.O., on the reverse) to Athens, franked by two overlapping Greece 20l blue Large Hermes Heads (margins in places) tied by a single fair dotted diamond cancel (matching the Greek P.O. "ALEXANDRIA" c.d.s. alongside), and also franked by an Egypt 3rd Issue 2pi yellow tied by a mostly fine "POSTE EGIZIANE/CAIRO" c.d.s. Very rare; very few Greece/Egypt Combination Covers have survived. PHOTO -  	£4000
