##1929 Prince Farouk's 10th Birthday

To celebrate Prince Farouk's 10th Birthday anniversary a set of stamps with a half-portrait of the Prince were issued. They were printed using offset-lithography by the Survey Department in Cairo and can be found with the centre vignette in black, brown or gray. The stamps although somewhat impressive in design they lack  crispness due to the printing techniques employed in ther production by the Survey Department.
