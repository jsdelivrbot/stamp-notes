Salt Tax

It is hard to regard the humble, ubiquitous white grains as one of the most influential commodities in human history. But the crucial role of sodium chloride in the diet of humans, animals and plants and countless applications within science, religion and other areas have seen it shape cultures, define economies, cause wars and, as such, become one of history's most taxed commodities.

Of the countless salt taxes throughout history, perhaps the most well-known example is that imposed by the British in colonial India. Salt taxation had existed in India for millennia, but in 1835 the British East India Company increased the rate significantly, and the British Empire continued the harsh taxes when it took over in 1858.

The hegemonic British salt tax in India received worldwide attention during March 1930, when Mahatma Ghandi led the Salt March to Dandi. It was to be the first act of the Salt Satyagraha, a campaign of non-violent protest against the British salt tax, and moreover, the first act of organized civil disobedience after India National Congress's declaration of independence. The campaign did not have much effect on the salt tax, but it increased global awareness and support for India's plight against British rule.
