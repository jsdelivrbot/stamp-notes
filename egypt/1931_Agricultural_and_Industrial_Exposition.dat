\section{1931: Agricultural and Industrial Exposition}

A design for these stamps was requested in March 1930. The Department of Antiquities supplied photographs of reliefs in the tomp of Ti in Saqqara. One photograph depicting a harvest scene was selcted and sketches were prepared; the designs were approved by King Fuad and the Ministry of Finance in December. The standard printing process was followed, starting with a line and wash drawing, leading to a photogravure cylinder of two panes of 50. A group of essays and incomplete proofs was in the Hewitt archive.
