##1866-1879 The Egyptian Stamps

The first stamps were issued during the reign of {{wi:Ismail_Pasha}}, 1863-1879. The series consisted of seven stamps, SG 1-SG7 with overprints in arabic script.

{{wi:Khedive}} Ismail (1863-1879), the ruler of Egypt, was convinced that the postal service is a public utility that should be carried out only by the government. Thus he negotiated the purchase of the private European post company which he bought on October 29,1864. The government started work at this new administration on January 1,1865 which is the birth date of the Egyptian Post Department. All foreign seals were replaced by others bearing the Egyptian Postal Department name. The department continued to have its headquarters in the city of Alexandria because of the city's trade activities. In January 1866 the first group of Egyptian stamps were 
printed in seven categories in Genoa, Italy, for the Egyptian government 



###Italian in Design
Essays for Egypt's first issue of stamps had been produced by several artists, notably
M.Prevost and M.Riester, both of Paris, and also by Messrs. Charles Skipper &East, London, but the printing order was given to an Italian firm, Fratelli Pellas, of Genoa, who some time before had submitted a design for the first Italian stamps (see also [Riester](../egypt/1866_Riester_Essays)). That essay although rejected by the 
Italian Government, formed the basis of the Egyptian 5 piastres value as far as the framework is concerned.

The production of this issue, which took place in Italy (Fratelli Pellas), 
was the first experience of the firm with printing stamps; 
the result was remarkably complex. Six of the seven values were lithographed. 
The value overprints, which were an integral part of the stamps, were lithographed on five values, 
typographed on two (1 piastre and 2 piastres). The paper for six of the values had an 
asymmetric watermark, and was printed more or less indiscriminately on 
one side or the other. 

This gave rise to four different watermark orientations. 

{{bulb:The 1 piastre was unwatermarked.}}

Perforation was also peculiar. 
Whereas most of each sheet was perforated 12 1/2, 
two vertical and two horizontal lines of perforation gauged 13. 
This gave rise to seven different combinations of the two gauges 
(furthermore, the 13-gauge machine was also used to correct an occasional missed line of perforation).

Finally, the process used to build the lithographic stones gave rise to ten transfer types and two different orientations of the background design. Although the designs were superficially symmetrical, being hand-drawn they actually differed from top to bottom in small features. This produced \tete varieties.

The postal rates were constant, 1 piastre per 10 grams for letters, 1 piastre for registration, 10 paras for printed matter, and 5 paras for newspapers. However, the rates to Upper Egypt followed a different pattern, for the mail was handled by a separate entity, the so-called Post of Mohammed Ali, a previously existing service developed for administrative mail. The rates were based on the weight in {{wi:dirhem}}s and the distance; examples are very rare. 




##1 piastre Mauve

###Bisects

The 2pi is found bisected both on pieces and on covers. It is quite rare.

In July, 1867, the post-office in Alexandria, ran short of the 1 piastre value. Article 52 of the postal decree of December 21, 1865, specifically prohibited the use of stamps cut in two, so on July 13, Muzzi Bey issued this notice at Alexandria:-
In consequence of the shortage of 1 piastre stamps, now current, permission is given to the post-office at Alexandria to use 2 piastre stamps, divided diagonally into equal parts, for the prepayment of letters, the two halves respectively representing the value of 1 piastre as from the 16th to the 31st July this year. The cutting of the stamps is to be from the left upper corner to the lower right, as in the specimen affixed in the margin.
Perforated and imperforate stamps were used for the provisional, and later they were employed at Cairo as well as Alexandria, specimens being more difficult to find with the Alexandria postmark. Other denominations have been found bisected, but they were never authorized and passed through the post by oversight.
