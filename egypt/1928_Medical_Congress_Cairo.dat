## 1928 Medical Congress Cairo

The set at a first glance does not look like it has anything to do with a Medical Congress. The 5m brown shows Imhotep and the 10m red Mohammed Ali Pasha. The Congress coicided with the centennial of the Qasr el Aini Hospital and School of Medicine which was founded by Mohammed Ali the Great. The stamps as issued commemorated both the events.

The stamps were printed by the Survey department in Cairo using photogravure and issued on the 15th December 1928.

\subsection{Quantities Printed}

The stamps were printed in much higher quantities than previous issues due to demand by collectors and teh low value of the set making it attractive to a broader spectrum of collectors.

\subsection{Varieties}

A variety exists on the sixth stamp of every other sheet on teh 10m red that has an "F" in place of "E" in the word "INTERNATIONAL".

Another curious and as Smith describes even unprecedented variety, a double watermark, one faint, on the 5m., was reported in 1972. Smith suggests that this was a result of a roll-back of the dandy-roll during manufacture of the paper (such a variety, repeated regularly throughout the sheet, has also been reported on the 15m. King Farouk ordinary stamp of 1937).
