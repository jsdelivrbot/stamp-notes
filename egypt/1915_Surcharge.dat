 
## 1915 Surcharge of 2 milliemes  

On October 15th 1915 a provisional surcharged stamp, 2m on 3m, was issued. The overprinting was done by the Government Printing Works, Boulaq, which was responsible for an essay of the surcharge as well. The essay had the surcharge arranged almost vertically, tilted slightly to the left; it was apparently printed as a strip of ten, set from loose type.
