This is the first pictorial issue of Egypt. It was necessitated by
the inability of persons ignorant of Arabic to recognise anything
characteristic of Egypt on the stamps of the first issue. The
design adopted, showing the sphinx and a pyramid in the centre,
left the country of origin no longer in doubt and made possible
the retention of Arabic lettering for the inscriptions.

The Decree announcing the issue is dated at Alexandria on 11th of July, 1867,
and the stamps came into use on ist of August following. The Post Office notice
bearing this Decree was printed in four languages, Arabic, Italian, French and
English, Italian sharing pride of place with the local tongue, an indication of the
great influence of Italians on the early postal development of the country.

Each notice announcing the issue, as exhibited in the various post offices,
carried a set of the six stamps. The example I pass round is evidence that
all values were ready for use on the 1st of August, 1867, and demonstrates the
shades of the original printing. In addition, it has the advantage of bearing
a copy of the 1 piastre stamp which shows remains of the extra character
in the lower label about which I have a good deal to say later. I only know of
one other specimen of this notice. It forms part of the Royal Collection in Egypt,
having formerly belonged to Mackenzie Low.

I will now attempt to summarise what has so far been written about these
stamps.

(a) They were designed by F. Hoff of Silesia and engraved by him on metal,
four times (2 X 2) for each value, the resulting blocks serving as the dies ; from
these, transfers were taken and, it is suggested, laid down on the lithographic
stone in double rows, each of five blocks of four, forming an entire sheet of 200
stamps, arranged in 20 horizontal rows of 10 each. (Melville.)
(I hope to show later that original stones were prepared by means of transfers
from the dies and that transfers from these original stones were taken to build
up the printing stones.)

(b) To another distinguished philatelist, P. L. Pemberton, belongs the honour
of having accurately described the characteristics of the four Die Varieties for each
value, which, in addition, he was able to allot to their correct positions on the
'die. This he did by studying a complete set of die proofs now in the Royal
Collection in Egypt. I show a photograph of these proofs which were struck in
black on two sheets of paper, on one of which are skeleton sketches of the central
ovals and parts of the frames of two stamps. Above these sketches are horizontal
lines apparently similar to the lines of the background of the stamps. (The
proofs are too clear and sharp to be from a lithographic stone, and as the four
variants of each design are the result of four separate engravings it is only right
that they should be described as Die Varieties rather than Types, as has been the
accepted custom hitherto. The latter is a term reserved by philatelists for
variants arising from the formation of a matrix stone, when the distinguishing
features result from blemishes inseparable from the acts of lithographic transfer,
whereas in the present instance the four varieties are essentially different, because
they were engraved separately by hand.)
Pemberton's article appeared in the Philatelic Journal of Great Britain for
April 2oth, 1910. It should be referred to for the details by which the four
varieties of each die may be recognised.

(c) V. Penasson of Alexandria printed the stamps, under Government supervision.
A plain white wove paper was used which was subsequently impressed
with a pseudo-watermark, a crescent with a five-pointed star above. At first a
colourless, but later a brownish, gum was used. Single-line perforation : 15 X I2 1/2.
All values except the 5 piastres are found imperforate. The 1 piastre exists
rouletted and also pin-perforated. No bisected stamps were authorised, though
the 10 para and i and 2 piastres are found genuinely used in this condition.

(d) In the Philatelic Journal of Great Britain for June, 1927, the late A. J. Sefi
described the extra character to be seen in the lower inscription on Variety II
of the 10 para value. He pointed out that this character was only seen on early
printings and was not present in colour on the die proof, from which facts he
surmised that the proofs had been taken subsequent to the original transfer. He
also considered that a second transfer had been laid down in 1869 on which no
traces of the extra character occurred. Further, he recognised for the first time
" a very distinct impression in albino " of the extra character on the die proof.

This he attempted to explain by suggesting that the depressed area had been
carefully filled in with metal, " so as not to take any ink when the plate was used
for transferring purposes," adding that " the metal must have projected very
slightly above the flat surface of the plate, giving, in consequence, a typographical
albino impression on the printed proof." (This was, of course, a very important
observation, as it confirmed the opinion that the dies were metal engravings, but
the explanation given is incorrect, as the impression of the character on the die
proof is raised above the surface of the paper and not depressed, as would have
been the case had metal projected in the way Sefi suggests.)

(e) The remains of a comparable extra character in the lower label of all four
varieties of the 1 piastre were described by me as occurring on the early printings
of that stamp. This observation was recorded in a short paper submitted in
competition for the Herts Philatelic Society's Cup in March, 1932. I shall refer
at some length to this matter later

(f) II Corriere Filatelico of March 3ist, 1934, contained an article by Dr. Emilio
Diena alluding to this same extra character on the i piastre. Diena omitted
to note that the remains of the character had a specific appearance on each
Die Variety and gave no satisfactory explanation of its disappearance or
significance.

(g) For a long time it has been recorded that some copies of the 1 piastre
have four dots over the right-hand word in the lower label, while others have only
three. This fact was ascribed by Mackenzie Low to various states of the die.
His assumption presupposed that more than one stone had been prepared for the
production of this stamp.

(h) Two main printings have been catalogued, the first in 1867, the second
in 1869.

\section{The Production of the Printing Stones}

So much for our knowledge to date. I now turn to a consideration of my
theories regarding the production of the printing stones.

First, let me say how much I owe to Mr. Charles Ecob, late of Perkins, Bacon
& Co., who has confirmed my observations and verified and extended greatly my
conclusions.

The die for each value was engraved four times, and I think we can accept the
fact that the engraving was done on metal and not on stone as suggested by
Dr. Diena.

The die proof of the 10 para which I show is, fortunately, of Variety II, and if
carefully examined can be seen to show the extra character in albino described
by Sefi. It will be noticed that the embossed albino impression is a faithful
reproduction of the character seen on the early printings of the stamps. More-,
over, it is raised above the surface of the paper. Had metal filling been used in
the way suggested by Sefi it is nearly certain the character would have become
deformed, and it would have been depressed instead of being raised.

Before stating how I think this appearance was produced, it would be well to
describe the steps by which the lithographic stone would be prepared from a die
engraved on metal.

Before inking, the metal die must be warmed (this process would effectually
rule out the use of certain materials, such as wax, etc., which might conceivably
have been used for filling unwanted lines or characters such- as the one under
discussion). The die was then inked and wiped, after which unwanted portions
of the design could be " stopped out" by being covered with portions of thin
paper. A transfer was then pulled and the "stopping out" paper took the
portion of the impression it was desired to avoid. The " stopping out " paper
must of necessity be extremely thin in order to avoid what is technically described
as " bridging " of the design beyond its margin. Such bridging would result in
blurring or disappearance of surrounding lines. Being thin, " stopping out "
paper would be unable to prevent the transfer paper sinking, under pressure,
into the engraved surface, but this would not result in anything more than an
albino impression such as we see on the die proof of the 10 para. What I have
described for the process of transfer would, of course, hold good when a die proof
was being taken on stouter material, and this, I believe, is the explanation of the
albino impression under consideration.

The transfer obtained in this way, bearing the four varieties of the die, was
laid down on a small lithographic stone technically known as the " original stone."
If required, the design could then be " touched up " in order to strengthen existing
lines or to make additions, this work being carried out by means of a fine brush
pencil with which lithographic ink would be applied.

The impression on the original stone was next " rolled up " to reinforce the
grease-retaining properties of the inked design and was then powdered with resin.
Subsequently, the stone was etched with weak nitric acid, to increase the greaserejecting
power of the blank areas and to add to their water-holding capacity.
The acid was then washed off with water, the stone was "gummed in " and
dried. Finally, the gum was washed off the ink used for " rolling up," the powder
was removed with turpentine and the stone became ready for the work of preparing
transfers wherewith the printing stone was to be laid down.

I have been unable to find evidence that anything like an intermediate stone
was prepared for any of the values. Fifty transfers, therefore, would be required
to lay down a printing stone for 200 stamps. These transfers were taken from
an original stone and not-from the die. Consideration of the stones used for the
printing of the i piastre will prove this statement.

An extra character, such as we have seen on the 10 para, could have -been
" stopped out " on the die, or could have been " destroyed " either on the original
stone or on the printing stone by means of acid. Undoubtedly, attempts of this
nature, varying with the different duties, were made during all three stages of
production and will be described in detail later. On the 10 para the extra character
must have been " stopped out " on the die, before the preparation of the second
printing stone. Hence the albino impression on the die proofs.

\section{Stamps}
We now turn to our consideration to the stamps.

\subsection{5 PARA}

There is little to say about this value. I have been able to reconstruct the
sheet, and on this I detect no evidence of (a) the use of an intermediate stone ;
(b) touching up or retouching ; (c) substituted transfers.

All blocks of this stamp which I have studied can be placed on the one sheet,
and it is fairly safe, therefore, to assume that only one stone was used and that it
did not undergo alteration in 1869 when the second main printing of this issue
took place.

Various shades of yellow can be recognised, from a pale lemon to a rich
orange-yellow.

Printing-stone flaws which are sufficiently prominent to be collectable are :

No. 14. A large coloured spot just within the oval to the north-west.

30. The " chain " flaw in the north-west quadrant of the stamp.

127. A white flaw involving the " p " of " PARA " at the left top corner
of the stamp.

144. A circular coloured flaw cutting the white oval in the west.

180. A small coloured flaw to the right of the apex of the pyramid


\subsection{10 PARA.}

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../egypt/extra-heh.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{marginfigure}
The 10pa. is particularly interesting because of the original presence of an unwanted letter \textit{heh}, in the lower panel on Type II. Stamps in the 1867 colours can be found with this extra letter on Type II firmly printed, blurred and somewhat faint, or nearly entirely absent (only a few specks showing). The unwanted letter must have been on the die and the original stone taken from it. Byam interpreted teh facts to mean that the letter was noticed during printing, and the job was interrupted while the stone was gone over by hand in an attempt, only partially successful, to remove it. After another press run the stone was worked on againwith nearly complete success.


Two stones can be recognised. STONE A is most readily differentiated by a
study of Variety II

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../egypt/stone-states.jpg}
\caption{States of the lower panel of Type II of the 1867 10 paras (Byam).}
\end{marginfigure}

(i) On this stamp the figure " i " in the left lower corner shows no defect in
its right-hand margin. The accompanying " o " is reasonably perfect and appears
like the " o " on the die proof.

(ii) In the lower label to the left of the first word (reading from the right) is
the additional character which has been alluded to in the description of the
production of the printing stones. This character is the Arabic letter " he ".
In the first state of the stone this extra character is sharp in outline and of the
same shade as the rest of design.

A second slate of the stone exists on which attempts have been made to destroy
the extra character by means of acid, with the result that blurred but easily
recognisable impressions of the " he " are all that remain.

These two states may further be recognised by the shades of ink employed
for the printing, the stamps being somewhat dull and muddy lilac ; two shades
of dull lilac exist from the stone in the first state, so it may be assumed that
destruction of the character was not attempted at once.

A third state of Stone A shows an almost complete destruction of the extra
character, no trace of which can be detected on many of the stamps; the most
that can be seen on any stamp is a collection of isolated coloured dots.
Stamps from the third state of the stone appear in a clear dull lilac and also a
cold pale lilac. I show a dated copy of the latter shade used in September, 1867,
which proves it to be from an early printing.
