This was the first Definitives issue depicting the Sphinx and the pyramid. A design that was to serve for over forty years. The first issue design was quite distinct from those that followed. The main characteristic being the Sphinx was in the front of the pyramid and all 
the inscriptions are in arabic text. Two letters can be found at the top left and right tablets. 'P' for 'POSTES' and 'E' for Egyptienne. In issues that follow these were replaced with the full inscriptions.



## 1872 The Sphinx is at the left of the pyramid

<p>
In 1872 the design was changed with the Sphinx now having moved to the left of the pyramid. It was also
a very crude printing. the 1872 issue was clearly printed and neatly perforated; the 1874 
issue was a mess - poorly printed on terrible paper and roughly perforated. The stamps were amongst the worse printing of the era, and showed both the inexperience of the Postal Department
as well as the Printers. You can find more about this issue here.

<h2>1879 De La Rue has Postes Egyptiennes at the top</h2>

<p>In 1879 the design of the definitive postage stamps was changed again to incorporate the 
words in French 'Postes Egyptiennes' to reflect the take-over of postal operations by the 
Egyptian posts. Notice the arabic inscription at the bottom. 
In the next issue this is to be moved to the top. 
This design was printed much more clearly as it was done in Britain by De La Rue. The selection of De La Rue was not
surprising given the poor printing by Penasson.</p>
<h2>1888 has Postes Egyptiennes at the bottom</h2>

<p>The last of the Sphinx issues was again re-designed in 1888. This time - and probably - to appease the growing nationalist movement had the 'Postes Egyptiennes' moved to the bottom and the arabic script on top.
To summarize the four issues can be distinguished easily by observing if the words 'Postes Egyptiennes' exist on the stamps and from the location of the Sphinx in relation to the pyramid.

<h3>1867 Definitives</h3>
<h4>SG 11-16</h4>

This was the first issue depicting the Sphinx and the Pyramid. 
For almost 40 years the design of Egyptian stamps displayed the Pyramid and Sphinx as their main motif. The different Types, various Essays, Proofs, variations and varieties of the three different printings of those issues are shown in the exhibit.
1867 69 The Penasson printing. The printing of the second issue of Egyptian stamps was given to V. Penasson in Alexandria. The design, from an essay by F. Hoff, was engraved by hand four times (2x2), thus creating four different Types. Lithographic stones of 200 stamps were used for printing. Blocks of four of all values are shown.

Lack of knowledge of the Arabic script by the European employees resulted in spelling and grammar mistakes in the Arabic, which are found in the 10 paras and 1 piastre stamps. Those mistakes were corrected during the printing process. Damages to the printing stones created constant flaws. The different stages of alterations and constant flaws are shown.

Stamps of this issue were perforated 15x12 . Some pin perforation and imperforate stamps are shown. The issue was given a false watermark, a star-and-crescent design being impressed into the reverse of each stamp.

Highlights of the exhibit include 5 paras and 10 paras together on a cover (Frame 4); 2 piastres and 5 piastres blocks of four (Frame 5); 5 piastres on cover (Frame 5).

###Newspaper bisects	

During the 2011 Spink Sale, two newspapers with bisects were on offer, these
realized over double the estimate, their rarity being understandable as only five full copies of newspapers with bisects are known. Highly unlikely for them to be offered again in an auction for some years.
