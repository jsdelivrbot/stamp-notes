##1956 Afro-Asian Festival, Cairo

The conference of Bandung was preceded by the Bogor Conference (1954) and was followed by the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Cairo[2] in September (1957) and the Belgrade Conference (1961), which led to the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement.[3] In later years, conflicts between the nonaligned nations eroded the solidarity expressed at Bandung.

The conference reflected what the organisers regarded as a reluctance by the Western powers to consult with them on decisions affecting Asia in a setting of Cold War tensions; their concern over tension between the People's Republic of China and the United States; their desire to lay firmer foundations for China's peace relations with themselves and the West; their opposition to colonialism, especially French influence in North Africa and its colonial rule in Algeria; and Indonesia's desire to promote its case in the dispute with the Netherlands over western New Guinea (Irian Barat).

Sukarno, the first president of the Republic of Indonesia, portrayed himself as the leader of this group of states, naming it NEFOS (Newly Emerging Forces).

The set is of poor design, but has yielded a major error which is shown below. Other minor errors exist.
