\section{1923-24 King Fuad}

\lettrine{T}{HIS} is a particularly interesting issue from many points of view. Never before had a portrait of the ruler appeared on any stamp of Egypt, for such a reproduction is forbidden in the Koran. As may be imagined, the reception by his subjects of King Fuad's likeness on the stamps of this issue was awaited with interest and possibly some anxiety, but so emancipated have the Egyptians become that no objection was raised and the innovation passed without trouble, probably being accepted as ocular demonstration that Egypt had gained her independence and that her ruler was truly her king. The previous overprinted issue had stated this fact and given March 15, 1922, as the date when the Kingdom came into being, but a portrait of the King on his stamps carried conviction throughout the length and breadth of a country where not everyone can read

For philatelists generally and for students of the stamps of Great Britain in particular
this issue calls for special comment, as it was the first to be produced by the photogravure process in England. Moreover it was printed by the firm of Harrison and Sons, which subsequently secured the contract to produce British stamps by this process, and there is little doubt that experience gained from the preparation of the Egyptian stamps stood the firm in good stead when the far larger undertaking was tackled. This can be seen by a study of the Egyptian stamps which reveal evidence of the difficulties encountered and the way they were overcome. Flaws and blemishes appeared on the Egyptian stamps and much retouching was required before the process was finally mastered, but so complete did this mastery become that I think I am right in saying that major varieties on the present stamps of Great Britain are practically unknown.

How the photogravure process was chosen for the issue of 1923-24 is also not without
interest. The original intention had been to print the stamps as line engravings and to this
end Harrison turned to Perkins, Bacon and Co. for help in the production of the necessary
dies.\cite{byam-fuad} Proofs of several line-engraved essays (Figs. 1 and 2) exist and correspondence between
the two firms has been found which proves beyond doubt that all preparations were being
made to employ the modern recess process for the printing of the stamps. But the inevitable
delays resulting from the collaboration of two printing houses caused impatience
on the part of a ruler waiting to appear before the world in his new role, and so enquiries
were sent to London asking for evidence of what was being done. To meet the demand
photogravure reproductions of certain essays were hastily prepared and sent to Cairo
(Fig. 3). When later the finished products by the line-engraved process were submitted forEgyptian approval, some disappointment resulted and hasty instructions were sent to the
effect that the photogravures were more pleasing and that the stamps were to be produced
by that method in consequence. So Egypt still remains a country without a line-engraved
stamp, to the sorrow of those of us who feel that no finer process for stamp production
exists. Also Perkins, Bacon ceased to be concerned with the issue, and Harrison and Sons
struggled through their growing pains alone and so enriched the philately of Egypt and
deprived the students of Great Britain of what might otherwise have been a stampic treat.

Various portraits of the King were tried (Figs. 4, 5 and 6) and experiments were made
with both corn-grain and linear screens (Figs. 7 and 8). Some of the resulting essays are truly horrible to behold. Details of the process eventually selected were given by Mr.
Harrison himself to the Philatelic Congress held at Brighton in 1932, but even he was unable
to explain how and when the retouching seen on the stamps was done. In an excellent
paper Douglas McNeille (Gibbons' Stamp Monthly, December 1937 to April 1938) has
summed up the possibilities as follows:
