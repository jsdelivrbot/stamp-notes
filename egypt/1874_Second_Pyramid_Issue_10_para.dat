The 10pa. is particularly interesting because of the original presence of an unwanted letter \textit{heh}, in the lower panel on Type II. Stamps in the 1867 colours can be found with this extra letter on Type II firmly printed, blurred and somewhat faint, or nearly entirely absent (only a few specks showing). The unwanted letter must have been on the die and the original stone taken from it. Byam interpreted teh facts to mean that the letter was noticed during printing, and the job was interrupted while the stone was gone over by hand in an attempt, only partially successful, to remove it. After another press run the stone was worked on againwith nearly complete success.


Two stones can be recognised. STONE A is most readily differentiated by a
study of Variety II

(i) On this stamp the figure " i " in the left lower corner shows no defect in
its right-hand margin. The accompanying " o " is reasonably perfect and appears
like the " o " on the die proof.

(ii) In the lower label to the left of the first word (reading from the right) is
the additional character which has been alluded to in the description of the
production of the printing stones. This character is the Arabic letter " he ".
In the first state of the stone this extra character is sharp in outline and of the
same shade as the rest of design.

A second slate of the stone exists on which attempts have been made to destroy
the extra character by means of acid, with the result that blurred but easily
recognisable impressions of the " he " are all that remain.

These two states may further be recognised by the shades of ink employed
for the printing, the stamps being somewhat dull and muddy lilac ; two shades
of dull lilac exist from the stone in the first state, so it may be assumed that
destruction of the character was not attempted at once.

A third state of Stone A shows an almost complete destruction of the extra
character, no trace of which can be detected on many of the stamps; the most
that can be seen on any stamp is a collection of isolated coloured dots.
Stamps from the third state of the stone appear in a clear dull lilac and also a
cold pale lilac. I show a dated copy of the latter shade used in September, 1867,
which proves it to be from an early printing.
