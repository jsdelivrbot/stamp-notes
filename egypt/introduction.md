\chapter{Egypt}

\lettrine{E}{gyptian philately}, like its history has a long and glorious past.  Unlike the Royal Collection of the Queen of England the Royal Collection of King Farouk has been dispersed and provided interest to issues that would not normally attract attention.
The Egypt Study Society has a number of active members and if you are serious about learning more about Egyptian stamps and postal history, you should consider joining the society.

When writing about a country's philatelic history (especially one with a lot of material) it is difficult to decide how to structure and organize it. The stamps, naturally are presented in a chronological order, whereas I tried to categorize the main periods of postal history. The menu at the left, has links to most of the articles.

Absent at this point in time are postmark studies such as those presented in the Cape of Good Hope sections.

A lot of good collections have come to the market over the last 5 years, so I was fortunate enough to gather information on pricing and images for most of the important items of Egyptian philately. If any of the material shown here, happens to be in your possession and would like me to credit your collection please drop me an email and I will do so. I also invite you to contribute to the website by providing further scans varieties and articles.

Lastly use the valuation and sales figures with caution. Without examining the actual material one relies on the auctioneers judgement in describing it. Most of them are very good, but mistakes do happen.

The historical notes on the sets from the fifties was to add a flavour to the revolutionary times and Nasser's overthrowing of the Monarchy. 

Egypt survived the Turks, Napoleon the British, two Great Wars and recent problems. It is a growing nation with an intelligent and educated young population. 

\section{Potential}
With an estimated 76 million people, Egypt possesses one of the most developed economies in the Mid-East, with a GDP growth rate of 5% -7%. The government is undertaking major economic reforms to further spur development, including massive investments in infrastructure and liberalizing economic and tax policies to encourage foreign investment. Egypt's main challenge in the years to come will be one of social and political democratization - how to assure that enough of the new wealth trickles down to the majority of the population to lessen the problems of poverty and political instability.

I expect a high growth in this philatelic market, so if you overspent in the last auction, don't worry, it is all right, I am more than sure that you will recoup your investment and a good profit when the time comes, and if you don't you would have enjoyed the ride.
