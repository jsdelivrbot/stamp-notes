\chapter{The Issued Stamps}

The stamps were received in Egypt in adequate time to distribute them to all post offices. A long decree, \textit{Rules for the Internal Postal Service}, was issued on December 21st 1865 to come into effect on January 1st. The following section excerpted from it announced the impeding stamp issue.

\heading{General Instructions}
\begin{letter}
The post offices alone are authorized to sell stamps.
The postage stamps are of seven different kinds, which are distinctive by the color and the value, that is to say:5, 10, and 20 paras. 1, 2, 5, and 10 piastres.

The correspondence for foreign countries must not been thrown into the letter boxes, but taken to the post offices. Foreign letters must be franked by Egyptian stamps to Alexandria, the foreign postage must then be paid in the stamps of the country that is responsible for delivery to their destination. Cairo, December 21st, 1865.

\closing{By order of\\ H.H. the Viceroy\\ Chancellor of the Exchequer, Hafiz Pasha\\ The Postmaster General, Muzzi Bay}

\end{letter}

\section{Blocks}

Although blocks of four or larger are known for all values, they are rare to very rare. Only one block unused, is known of th 10pi., and of the 5pi,, two unused blocks and a block of twelve. 

Used blocks are generally scarcer than unused, but one or more is known for each value up to the 5pi. Blocks of any sort with sheet margin are exceptional.

\section{Uses}

Covers of the 1pi. are relatively common; it paid the single rate (up to 10 grams.) The 5pa. was intended for periodicals mailed by the publisher. Used in that way, it was customarily affixed to the banner head of newspapers. Examples are rare and there probably no more than four, all of which are cut down to various extents. The 5pa. is also known used in multiple or in conjunction with other stamps to pay the letter rate (eight copies were required); examples are rare.

The 10pa., which was intended for non-periodical prints (including greeting cards), is very scarce used as single on cover, and only slightly less scarce used in a strip or block of four to pay the letter rate. The 20pa. is a true rarity used alone as a single on cover, for the only rate for which it was suited was for very light letters sent from Cairo south carried by the State Courier Post to places not yet served by the Viceroyal post. By contrast, pairs of the 20pa. used to pay teh single letter rate are not unusual. A registered cover franked with six copies, paying the combined registration and postage, is known.
