###Avis de Reception

The "AR" stands for "Avis de Reception" or advice of receipt. A slip was attached to the cover by a piece of tape, sticker, staple or even selvage from stamps which is often still left behind (as it is on two of these here). The boxed "AR" was applied directly to the stamp which paid the rate of 5m or 1pi for the service. As many of the covers were also registered (charge being 1pi before 1906 and 5m thereafter), these covers tend to be quite colorful as multiple stamps were used to cover all the charges.
