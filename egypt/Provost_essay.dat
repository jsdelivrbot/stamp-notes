##Provost Essay
On the 1st of January 1866, the first set of stamps to be used in Egypt was issued. It was a set of seven stamps (5, 10, 20 paras and 1,2, 5, 10 piasters). Actually, as Egypt was under Turkish suzerainty, those stamps were Turkish stamps overprinted for Egypt. (I tried to find a good scan of those stamps but did not succeed. I only found very bad quality scan). A funny detail about those stamps is that they caused problems to postal clerks from Europe and elsewhere because they could not determine the country of origin. As a result a new series of stamps was ordered for 1867, in which the central design left no doubt as to the country of origin: the Sphinx and Pyramid at Giza were placed in the centre of the design, 
with Cleopatra's Needle and Hadrian's column in Alexandria in the side panels.

Among the printers who submitted designs were two from Paris, Prevost and Reister; the Pellas brothers of Genoa, and V. Penasson of Alexandria. Into the early 1900's, the list expands to include New York, London, Florence and Milan, Italy, Zurich, Cairo and Boulac, Egypt.
