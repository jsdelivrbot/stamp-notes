##The 1910's

The revolution of 1911 
resulted in overprints on the imperial stamps in 1912; 
at Foochow to indicate that the post office was effectively a neutral area available to both sides, and at Nanking and Shanghai reading "Republic of China". An additional set of overprints were produced by Waterlow and Sons in London, and postmasters throughout the country made their own unofficial overprints using the same characters.

The first new designs of the Republic were two commemorative sets of 12 each, the first set depicting Sun Yat-sen and second Yuan Shikai, both issued on 14 December, 1912.
A 5-cent "junk" from the redesign of 1923.

The definitives of the "Junk issue" went on sale 5 May 1913, 
and continued in use into the 1930s.

The low values featured a junk, while values from 15c to 50c showed a 
farmer reaping rice, while the dollar values depicted the three-part gateway to 
the Hall of Classics in Beijing. 


The series was first printed in London, then in Beijing from 1915; 
they can be distinguished by close examination. 

The designs were re-engraved in 1923, and a number of design features were changed; 
for instance, the whitecaps in the water underneath the junk were removed, and the water darkened.
