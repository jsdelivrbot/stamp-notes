\chapter{British Post Office}

A British Consular Office was opened in Alexandria in 1839 (possibly before\cite{lowe-egypt-01}), followed by similar post offices at Suez in 1847 and at Cairo in 1859. Similar steps were taken by other Governments: Austria, France, Greece, Italy and Russia all opened offices in Alexandria, the French in addition opened offices in Cairo, Post said and Suez. The British Offices remained open until 1882 (the year when the Military occupation took place).

Pre-adhesive handstamps are easily found with the exception of the "PAID" which are scarce. A letter\cite{cor186} is illustrated in Figure~\ref{alexpaid} prepaid at 1/8 d. The letter travelled via Malta and the overland to Liverpool.

\section{British adhesives used in Egypt}

In 1860 the then current stamps of Great Britain were placed on sale in these offices, followed by succeeding issues as these made their appearance in Great Britain. These offices continued to operate until the British Military  occupation took place in 1882.

They can be recognized by the cancellation "B O1" for Alexandria nd "B O2" for Suez. A curious practice was adopted in Cairo where the mail handled was comparatively small. Adhesives were not on sale at the Post Office and all mail was marked with the Cairo date-stamp Type [PR]; if the mail bore British adhesives, the cover was date-stamped at Cairo but the adhesives cancelled "BO 2" in transit. Such covers are rare.
