\chapter{Fourth period: 1902-1915}

The Fourth Period of the Fourth Issue, is characterised by two new features: the paper was changed from ordinary to chalk surfaced, and the style of printing plate saw a phased changeover to one having printed 'pillars' in the vertical gutter, and an interrupted, rather than continuous, buffer bar around each pane (Figure 19b).

The date of appearance of stamps printed on chalk-surfaced paper cannot be precisely documented,and the archival correspondence we have been able to consult does not touch on the subject, but catalogues have traditionally given the date as 1902, when De La Rue began using such paper generally for all its stamp printing. All values, from 1m to l0pi, were printed on this paper, and the new supplies were presumably commingled indiscriminately with the old. 

The effect of the new paper was a slightly sharper image (but that is not enough for easy identification). It is said that the major justification for the use of chalk-surfaced paper was security, to combat re-use of cleaned stamps. However, the Egyptian stamps on this paper do not suffer significant damage on soaking in cold water.

A defining test for chalk-surfaced paper is the appearance of a mark resembling pencil-lead graphite when it is touched with a piece of clean silver (a piece of jeweller's silver wire is suitable). It is best applied carefully to a single perforation tooth, to avoid marring the stamp. Examining the surface with a low-powered microscope with overhead lighting (a 'dissecting microscope'), with attention not only to the unprinted areas, but also to the edges of the printed parts, can be more reassuring, for there are differences in the surface texture and in the sharpness of the edges of the inked areas (an ordinary magnifying glass is not usually good enough). Chalksurfaced paper is likely to be more opaque than ordinary paper. Because it is difficult to convey these distinctions with precision in words, I strongly recommend spending some time with authentic examples. The
4m of 1906 is an excellent reference stamp, for it exists only on chalk-surfaced paper.

For ordinary paper, any of the stamps in obsolete currency, or in colours that became obsolete before 1900, will serve.

The new paper was used for printings from plates in the second style as well as the third, new plates coming into use as required to replace worn ones. I have not seen the 2m, 2pi or l0pi printed from third-style plates; it seems unlikely that it would ever have been justified to prepare a new plate for the l0pi, considering the small numbers requisitioned. The characteristic interrupted buffer bars allow any marginal block from third-style
plates to be recognised; the earliest postmark date I have seen is June 1902, on a 5m.
Egypt was one of the pioneers in adopting the practice of selling stamps in booklets.

Correspondence with De La Rue in July 1902 refers to 'the American kind of booklet', and an order was placed for booklets of 24 5m stamps, to be sold for 212m. They were fabricated from ordinary sheets, which could easily be cut into booklet panes of six (2x3), with selvedge at the top for attaching. The stamps thus differed in no way from those sold in
sheets, except that the perforations show the effect of guillotining along the edges of the panes. Depending on the precision of the cutting, the teeth may be unusually long or extremely blunt, but always cleanly cut, rather than torn. These stamps are most desirably collected as complete booklets, or at least with the accompanying booklet covers. These are, alas, extremely rare. The booklets were issued to the public on 1 January 1903.


In February 1903, an order was placed for 50,000 similar booklets of 3m stamps, to be sold for 73m. The foregoing remarks about the 5m booklets apply equally well to the 3m. They were issued on 1 July 1903. A third booklet was issued in 1911, essentially the same as the first 5m booklet, but with the imprinted price reduced to 120m, and with advertising printed on the interleaves. A proposal was made 3 to prepare booklets containing
three different values, 3m, 5m and Ipi, but it never came to fruition.

The last new value of the Fourth Issue, 4m, was ordered on 8 July 1906 and, for reasons of economy, De La Rue suggested using the same die as used for the 4m postal cards. Egypt was not convinced, and proposed a different design; eventually, a design with a nearly white sky was chosen, and 800,000 stamps were ordered, the colour to be 'brick-red'25. Die proofs are known in black and in brick-red. Delivery was promised in nine weeks,
and the stamps were issued at an unrecorded date in late 1906. They were printed from a third-style plate. The purpose of this denomination was to pay the UPU rate for postcards, picture postcards having become tremendously popular at the turn of the century. Further orders were placed in December 1906 (2,400,000), 1910
(2,040,000) and 1911 (2,400,000).

A letter from the Postal Administration in March 1910 brings to light a hidden aspect of Egyptian philately. It plainly states This administration has placed at the service of the public an automatic machine for the sale and distribution of postage stamps', and goes on to specify a requirement for rolls of 500, and to ask about the cost of manufacture. No coil stamps have previously been recognised for Egypt (barring unissued trials with
the first King Fuad 5m), and the letter is therefore quite remarkable. On 8 April 1910, De La Rue sent sample
rolls of 500 and 1500, with quotes, and on 12 May Egypt ordered 500 reels of 1500 of the 5m (thus, 7,500,000
stamps!). No further orders for reels appear in the records. The rolls that were supplied would almost certainly
have been made up from sheet stamps, cut into strips and joined in 'paste-up' fashion. The stamps would
therefore be identical to sheet stamps, but might be recognisable by having guillotined perforations on two
parallel edges (thus differing from booklet stamps). Quite some time ago, the late George Houston found
several such stamps in a wholesale mixture, and speculated whether they might be unrecorded coils27;
apparently he was right. I have since found an example, postmarked 26 XI12 at Alexandria, tied to piece across
the guillotined edges (Figure 27). The date is right, and the place of use reasonable. Furthermore, a vintage
stamp-vending machine is on display in the Cairo Postal Museum.
The 1m, 2m, 4m, 5m, Ipi, 2pi and 5pi on chalk-surfaced paper exist as imperforate plate proofs on gummed,
watermarked paper; they came onto the market from the De La Rue archives. A date, presumably that of
printing accompanied by manuscript initials, appears on a corner sheet margin. These sheets must therefore be press-run proofs, like those noted earlier, but now imperforate. The handstamped dates are remarkable in that
some are as late as 1919, five years after the appearance of the succeeding issue, the 1914 pictorials! The
explanation may be that they were anticipated to be required for making continuing supplies of the overprinted
official stamps (first issued in 1907), but I have found nothing in the De La Rue records that sheds light on the
matter.


Two uses of stamps in the Fourth Period deserve special mention. In 1910, a pioneer air meeting at Heliopolis Aerodrome was provided with a temporary post office having a special datestamp inscribed for it . Examples, mostly applied to souvenir postcards, are quite scarce, and much sought after (Figure 28). In 1915, troops from New Zealand were sent to Egypt, following the outbreak of World War I. They brought with them a military
post office, and the soldier's letters and postcards were initially franked with Fourth Issue stamps (Figure 29) (even though the 1914 pictorials were already in general use). They were cancelled with the appropriate military post office datestamps29'30. Cancellations of other forces (British, Indian, Australian and even French Tresor
et Posies') also exist on this issue, but they appear generally to be favour cancellations.

\subsection{Bisects}
Although several stamps of the Fourth Issue are known bisected on covers, they are at best
philatelically contrived, without any sort of authorisation , except for the bisection of the 4m in 1909. A
shortage of official stamps was compounded by a shortage of 2m and 3m ordinary stamps at some post offices.
Even though the use of ordinary stamps on official mail was authorised in June 1909 in cases of shortage32,
emergencies still arose. In November 1909, the Gizira post office resorted to bisecting the 4m for use with an
ordinary 1m stamp to make up the local letter rate on official letters bearing the 'no value' brown official
stamp33 (Figure 30). Examples are very rare.
