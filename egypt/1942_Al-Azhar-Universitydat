##1942 Unissued Al-Azhar University

When King Farouk's collection was sold at auction  a number of surprises came. One was the unissued Al-Azhar University,
stamps. Apparently only 102 of each value were printed and hence are quite rare.

EGYPT 1942 unissued {{wi:Al-Azhar_University}}, 6m green, 15m dull purple and 20m gray, three diff., without the red overprint applied when the set was later released.
 Only 102 of each value were printed and discovered during the King Farouk auction
