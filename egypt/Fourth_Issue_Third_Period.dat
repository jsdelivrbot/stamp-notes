A changeover from paras to milliemes defines this period.
This period also saw the introduction of new plates. Plates made during this period had buffer bar, thick bars of colour forming a continuous line against each pane. This period also saw the introduction of postal stationery envelopes, some rate changes required a new denomination (3m.), and the appearance of a 10pi. stamp, a value not seen since the end of the First Issue of 1867.

According to Easton , Egypt sent an order to De La Rue on March 29th 1887 for a total of 10,300,000 stamps, accompanied by sketches and instructions to replace the inscriptions on the 5, 10 and 20 para stamps by new ones of 1, 2, and 5 mills. respectively, owing to the suprression of para currency. The Postal Administration also ordered that the relative position of the French and Arabic inscriptions be reversed so that he Arabic would be at the top. De La Rue objected that any changes would require new dies and plates and therefore would be costly, but Egypt knew what it wanted and was insistent. The new stamps were sent on November 18th and were put on sale January 1st 1888.

\section{Uses}

The 3m. maroon used alone on cover is very scarce indeed, and ven the 3m. orange-yellow is difficult to find used by itself on an envelope. However, the latter is relatively common  used alone on postcards. The 2pi. brown is common on cover; it paid for a single-weight registered UPU letter as well as for double weight ordinary letters.

The 10pi. is a rarity used on an envelope; such use would have been needed only for an exceptionally heavy object (really too large for an enevelope), or for a letter insured for a content of substantial value. The major use of the 10pi. was on parcel cards, which are themselves quite scarce and usually in poor condition. Most of them seem to have been used for export of cigarettes, which were generally posted at the Customs post office in order to obtain reimbursement ("drawback") of the duty paid on the bulk tobacco originally imported.
