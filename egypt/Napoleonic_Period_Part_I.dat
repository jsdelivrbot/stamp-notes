The Revolutionary Calendar was officially in use from 22 September 1793 (1st Vend&#233;miaire of year II) till the end of 1805 (11. Vent;se of XIV). 

The time period started actually on the 22nd September 1792. So the republican year started on the 22nd September (Gregorian) and ended after 12 month &#224; 30 days on the 16th September of the following (Gregorian) year. The remaining 5 days (17th till 21st September) were added as the so called "Sanscullotides"). During leap years (1796, 1800, 1804) an additional Sanscullotide (the "jour compl;mentaire") was added.
