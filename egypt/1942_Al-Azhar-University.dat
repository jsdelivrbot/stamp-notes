##1942 Millenary of Al-Azhar University (Unissued)

When King Farouk's collection was sold at auction  a number of surprises came. One was the unissued Al-Azhar University,
stamps. Apparently only 100 of the 10m and 20m  value were printed and 102 for the other values.

The stamps were printed by photgravure by the Survey Department in Cairo.
