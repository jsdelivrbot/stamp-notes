##1942 Millenary of Al-Azhar University (Unissued)

When King Farouk's collection was sold at auction  a number of surprises came. One was the unissued Al-Azhar University,
stamps. Apparently only 100 of the 10m and 20m  value were printed and 102 for the other values.

The stamps were printed by photgravure by the Survey Department in Cairo. 

EGYPT 1942 unissued {{wi:Al-Azhar_University}}, 6m green, 15m dull purple and 20m gray, three diff., without the red overprint applied when the set was later released.
 Only 102 of each value were printed and discovered during the King Farouk auction
