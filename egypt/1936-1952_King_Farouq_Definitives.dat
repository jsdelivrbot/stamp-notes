The original nine values, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 13, 15 and 20m., were issued together on July 29th 1937, the day on which King Farouk officially ascended to the throne. They were supplemented by a 6m. on October 20th 1940 after the letter rate had been increased to 22m, it was not appropriate for the 20. to be blue, and its color was changed to slate.

\section{Colour Trials and Proofs}




\section{Royal Printing}

Royal proofs imperforate, overprinted CANCELLED on the back and with oblique skewed perforations on watermarked paper, were prepared for each control number, as usual the booklet-panes also included. A third type of Royal proof made its appearance with this issue; imperforate sheetlets of nine, on watermarked paper. Three such sheetlets, of the 6m. only, were in the Palace Collection.

A small portion of the paper delivered to the Survey Department was gummed on the wrong side, thus leading to some of the stamps being printed on the wrong side. The 2m. is also known with reversed watermark, but the cause was different. The paper was gummed correctly, but was inserted in the press improperly and was thsu printed on the gummed side; The variety was discovered in Port Said and apparently only 40 copies were saved. The variety has been faked by the simple method of washing the stamp and applying new gum to the face side. The watermark on such fakes would be normal, rather than reversed. Another give awy is to determine that the printed impression is underneath the gum instead of on top of it.


\section{Paper}

The paper used during the later printings was of a poorer quality, rough and greyish, in contrast to the smooth white apper used at first, a consequence of the wartime difficulties. The 20m. slate was entirely printed on such paper.
