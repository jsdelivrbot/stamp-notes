\section{1884-88 Second Period}


The defining feature of the Second Period is the adoption of the colour scheme of the UPU agreement (this colour scheme was optional at the time, and became a requirement only at the Washington Convention in 1897). The agreement defined three basic classes of international mail: printed matter (Vid, Ic, or 5 centimes) green; postal cards (Id, 2c, or 10 centimes) red, and letters (2Vfcd, 5c, or 25 centimes) blue. The colours of the
corresponding Egyptian stamps, lOpa, 20pa, and Ipi, did not correspond. At the same time, a new watermark dandy roll was brought into use, creating a recognisably different, albeit similar, watermark (see ahead).

The order for stamps in the new colours, which was sent on 24 December 1883, included a colour change for the 5pi as well. It was changed to grey, because its erstwhile green colour was adopted for the lOpa. The order was shipped in five consignments, between 20 February and 27 June 1884.
