## Georgia

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Georgia.
Georgia is in the Caucasus region of Eurasia. Situated at the juncture of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, it is bounded to the west by the Black Sea, to the north by Russia, to the south by Turkey and Armenia, and to the east by Azerbaijan. Georgia covers a territory of 69,700 kmÂ² and its population is 4.385 million.
At the beginning of the 19th century, Georgia was annexed by the Russian Empire.[1] After a brief period of independence following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Georgia was invaded by Bolshevik armies in 1921 and incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1922. The independence of Georgia was restored in 1991.

[edit]Independence again

Following the fall of the Soviet Union, Georgia became independent again in April 1991 and issued stamps in its own name from 31st July 1993.[2] Unlike other ex-Soviet republics, Georgia did not overprint Soviet stamps to meet their postal needs after independence,[3] although a number of overprints were carried out on Georgian stamps in 1994.[2]
[edit]Abkhazia

Stamps have been produced purporting to be from the Republic of Abkhazia, an area in western Georgia that is recognised as a sovereign state by few countries. Most stamps of Abkhazia are believed to be bogus, produced in foreign countries solely for sale to collectors, but more recently Abkhazia has produced stamps that may have legitimate use locally within the borders of the disputed area.[4] They are not recognised by the UPU.[5][6][7]
