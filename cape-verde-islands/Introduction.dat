\chapter{Stamps and Postal history Cape Verde Islands}

Cape Verde (Cabo Verde), a former Portugeuse Colony, is a group of ten islands in the Atlantic Ocean located 350 miles west of Senegal. The Capital is Praia, and the population was 181,000 in 1940. Cape Verde achieved independence from Portugal in 1975.

Because of location, Cape Verde was an important port in the Atlantic slave trade. Pirates, including Sir Francis Drake, twice attacked in the 1580's. Charles Darwin visited the islands in 1832. Finally, Cape Verde is not particularly "green".  Rather the  archipelago were named for Cap Vert on the Senegal coast.
