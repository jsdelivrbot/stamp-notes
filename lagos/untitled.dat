The Consul at Lagos was officially appointed Packet Agent in 1859 when teh similar appointment was made for Fernando Po, and instructions were sent out, with a Crowned Circle PAID AT LAGOS handstamp and a Lagos datestamp, in February, 1859. 

The King of Lagos failed to keep tyhe terms of the Treaty and further action proved necessary. H.M.S. Prmetheus, an 800-ton, five-gun, paddle wheel sloop based on Fernando Po, reach Lagos on 26 July, 1861, and after several conferences the King signed a Treaty on the sixth of August ceding the Territory. The Captain reporting events said he would not be able to leave Lagos until troops arrived to maintain the occupation. 

In 1869 a large (30.5mm) double circle datestamp was introduced reading POST OFFICE. LAGOS/WEST COAST OF AFRICA enclosing a one line date. According to Robson Lowe\RLII{295} is believed to ahve been made to teh order of a Mr. J. Carrol, a Lagos merchant who was acting Postmaster at the time. 

The Crowned Circle PAID AT LAGOS handstamp was used in the 1870s. A straightline REGISTERED handstamp was used at about the same time.

A circular datestamp was sent to Lagos on 21st January, 1872, with the name curved at the top, and this was used as \textit{pre-paid} mark before the introduction of postage stamps in 1874.
