Although the first stamps of Lagos were not invoiced until 1874 the first enquiry to De La Rue for postage stamps was sent by the Crown Agents on June 2, 1868. The details are outlined in DLRH (page 281) and are interesting as after quoting the usual cost of supplying six dies and printing plates of 120 multiples, with the alternative cost of plates of 120 multiples, the firm again put forward the idea of printing from key duty plates.

The Lagos order was not placed until 1874, and when the time came the multiples on the key and duty plates were limited to sixty.

An order was received from the Crown Agents on January 6, 1874, fo a die a keyplate of 60 multiples and four duty plates at the standard rates. It was stated that the stamps should be 'of a similar design as those supplied to Sierra Leone in 1871'. In acknowledging this on January 16th the firm stated: 'We presume howver taht while adhering to teh general arrangement of the [Sierra Leone](../sierra-leone/introduction) stamp you would wish it to be dissimilar in the ornamental details?' They submitted a design which was approved on the same day. The invoice was dated May 12th and a small quantity was printed for the first order: One Penny, 1980; Twopence, 1,980;Fourpence, 1,920; Six-pence, 2,040. Orders for reprints however were received at regular intervals.

On November 18, 1874 the firm invoiced duty plates of 60 multiples for a new Threepence and One Shilling for Lagos. The first printings were 3,000 and 3,120 respectively. A further small quantity was desptached on December 14th.

The spacing of the value on the 1s. is found measuring 15 ½ mm. And 16 ½ mm. And there is a variety without the cross bar to the “G” of “SHILLING”.

Lagos was the first Colony to issue stamps of the higher values 2/6, 5/- and 10/-, but the principal use of the 10/- was for fiscal purposes.

A stamp size die proof in black on glaze card of the head plate with blank value tablet. Also proofs (cut down) of the 1d to 1/- value tablets, the 3d & 1/- with m/s "Lagos". Usual surface faults. A scarce set. (7 proofs). Estimated Value: £300 Hammer Price: £480.
