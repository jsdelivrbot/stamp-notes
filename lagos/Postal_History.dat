\chapter{Postal History}


The Consul at Lagos was officially appointed Packet Agent in 1859 when the similar appointment was made for Fernando Po, and instructions were sent out, with a Crowned Circle PAID AT LAGOS handstamp and a Lagos datestamp, in February, 1859. 



The King of Lagos failed to keep tyhe terms of the Treaty and further action proved necessary. H.M.S. Prometheus, an 800-ton, five-gun, paddle wheel sloop based on Fernando Po, reach Lagos on 26 July, 1861, and after several conferences the King signed a Treaty on the sixth of August ceding the Territory. The Captain reporting events said he would not be able to leave Lagos until troops arrived to maintain the occupation. 

In 1869 a large (30.5mm) double circle datestamp was introduced reading POST OFFICE. LAGOS/WEST COAST OF AFRICA enclosing a one line date. According to Robson Lowe\RLII{297} is believed to ahve been made to teh order of a Mr. J. Carrol, a Lagos merchant who was acting Postmaster at the time. 

The Crowned Circle PAID AT LAGOS handstamp was used in the 1870s. A straightline REGISTERED handstamp was used at about the same time.

A circular datestamp was sent to Lagos on 21st January, 1872, with the name curved at the top, and this was used as \textit{pre-paid} mark before the introduction of postage stamps in 1874. 

\section{French Mails}

Under the first Anglo-French Postal Convention of 1843 mail from British Colonies for France and beyond was charged at 3/4 per ounce, and from 1846 to 1855 such letters were marked with a rectangular framed COLONIES/&c ART.13 handstamp to indicate the appropriate way-bill section for charging purposes. During 1856, and following re-arrangement, a new marking COLONIES/ART-18 was substituted ubtil the second Anglo-French Postal Convention held that year provided a new series of markings.\sidenote{Colin McCaig, \textit{The Postal History and Handstamps of British West Africa.}, Robson Lowe Ltd., 1978.}

Sale: 696
Lot: 168				NIGERIA - LAGOS
OFFICER'S 6d CONCESSION RATE COVER FROM HMS JASEUR AT LAGOS FRANKED BY G.B. 1d REDS; Jan. 1869 env. (overall wrinkling and part reverse lost with flap, but attractive) to Dublin endorsed "Officer's letter, HMS Jaseur" on the front and franked by six GB 1d Reds (pl.111; 2 pairs & 2 singles; originally a Block of Six) all tied by fine Liverpool "466" numerals struck in transit with red "PAID/LIVERPOOL/BR. PACKET" c.d.s. on the front (1 Feb. 1869). HMS Jaseur's log records that she was at Lagos on 5 Jan. 1869 when the 'Biafra' mail steamer sailed with letters for England (where she arrived at Liverpool on 1 Feb., fitting the c.d.s. date exactly). There is an intriguing P.S. on the reverse; "Send me some stamps; mine are all gone. J.R.B.". This is doubly significant; it shows that officers preferred to use 6d stamps rather than use up the ships' 1d Reds intended for other ranks mail, and that the writer was Asst. Surgeon Dr. J.R. Burke who served on HMS Jaseur at this date. [Illustrated in NOL, p.26.]		Estimated Value: £340
