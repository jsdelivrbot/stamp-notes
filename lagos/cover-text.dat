The cover image shows the 1884-1886 10/- purple-brown SG29, Sc37., which is one of the scarcer stamps of Lagos. These high values were probably only used for fiscal purposes. Dangerous forgeries exist for these high values, as well as fakes made from "SPECIMEN" copies, which were erased and forged cancellations added.
