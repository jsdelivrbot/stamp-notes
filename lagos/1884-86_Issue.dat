\section{1886 High Values}
The higher values for the West African Colonies were not required primarily for postage, but for use by the Registrar in COurt in payment of fees. This was made clear by the Acting Colonial Scretary of Lagos when sending to teh Crown Agents the requisition for postage stamps of the value of Two Shillings and Sixpence, Five Shillings and Ten Shillings. This letter was forwarded to De La Rue on August 18, 1886. The firm quoted the usual charge of \poud12 for each overprint plate, and then suggested that if the Lagos stamps were to be used for revenue purposes the keyplate should be printed in doubly fugitive ink. They submitted a new colour scheme on these lines. The Crown Agents decided however, that the six lower duties should continue to be printed in the same colours.

The new duty plates and stamps were invoiced on October 12th, and the following numbers were charged: Two Shillings and SIxpence 900; Five Shillings, 600; Ten Shillings, 420;

The specimens were not invoiced until a further supply was included in the Quarterly consignment invoiced on March 31, 1887.
