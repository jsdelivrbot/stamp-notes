\chapter{1887-1903}
In the meantime the Crown Agents had passed De La Rue's suggestion to the Colony, who replied on October 13th:

\begin{letter}
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt on teh 9th instant of your letter of teh 6th September last No. 141/63 covering a letter from Messrs. De La Rue & Co., upon the subject of printing stamps for Lagos in tehir doubly fugutuve inks, and I am obliged to you for submitting the question for consideration.

2. It is required that all Stamps should be available for use either for Postal or Judicial services, and if the doubly fugitive ink stamps can be used without distinction, I think it desirable to adopt the more protective method anf shall be glad if you will arrange accordingly.

3. I am assuming that the use of Purple and Green inks will not conflict with the arrangements made as to colours with the International Postal Union.

4. Messrs De La Rue's letter and Appendix are returned herewith as desired.
\end{letter}

The firm replied on November 19th with the obvious retort --- the example in this matter of Postal Convention colours set by Great Britain herself. The real culprit, however was the doubly fugutive ink, which De La Rue had by now established firmly in the Inland Revenue and Crown Agents Office as teh only possible ink in which any revenue stamp could be printed with propriety. Under the new system of correspondence the firm expressed their view concisely:

\begin{letter}
Letter returned herewith.

If the Stamps were printed in the doubly fugitive inks the regulations of the Postal Convention would undoubtedtly be overridden; but they have been entirely overridden in the case of England, and the new series of Stamps, which are about to be issued by the General Post Office, do not conform to them in any way.
\end{letter}


\section{1891 2 1/2 Pence}

The order for the new Twopence halfpenny\sidenote{DLRH:503} was responded by De la Rue suggesting on Februarym 1891 shoudl be supplied from the Lagos keuplate in blue, with a blue overprint. This was approved and the overprint plate was charged at\pound12, indicating that it was produced from leads from a steel die, so that there is no explanations of the variations in the size of the lettering for the duty.

\section{1893 5 Pence., 7 1/2 Pence and Tenpence}

The requisition for three new Lagos duties was sent by the Crown Agents on October  2, 1893. The firm sent three designs with colour suggestions on October 17th, and these were approved on the following day, except that the Crown Agents asked for the lettering '7 1/2 PENCE'.

The three overprint plates, stamps and 750 Specimens of each were invoiced on December 30th, when the following quantities were charged: Fivepence, 5160; 7 1/2 Pence, 5,220; Tenpence, 5,100.\ibid{524}

\section{1899  Keyplate}

De La Rue advised the Crown Agents on June 1, 1899 that the Lagos keyplate was worn out, as it had yielded approximately 68,000 impressions.\ibid{627} A new one was sanctioned on August 11th, and invoiced as No.2 on October 17th. The printings found with Plate 2 are for the 1/2d., 1d., 6d. and 1/-.\RLII{298}
