\chapter{Disaster Mail}    
In 1907 the SS. JEBBA ran aground in fog on the Devon Coast (AMrch 18th 1907) carrying mail from Lagos, Sierra Leone and the Nigerias. Lagos at this time was the capital of Southern Nigeria but its stamps were still in use. Strictly speaking these covers should come under [Southern Nigeria](../southern-nigeria/introduction). The cachet "SALVED FROM/SS. JEBBA" appears in two major types possibly made of loose rubber type. A similar manuscript cachet is known on cover dated the day of the wreck.\RLII{296} 

Figures~\ref{disaster1} and \ref{disaster2} show the two cachet types.
