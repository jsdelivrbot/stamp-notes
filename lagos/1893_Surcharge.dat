\chapter{1893 Surcharge}
A shortage of Halfpenny stamps in 1893 resulted in the postal authorities surcharging locally the 4d. mauve with the words HALF PENNY and a bar obliterating the FOUR PENCE.
\ph[30%]{../lagos/1893-double-surcharge.jpg}{1893 QV ½d on 4d variety SURCHARGE DOUBLE (SG 42a). F/M, horizontal light crease which may be related to the doubling of the overprint. Signed: Drahn. (cv£65).}

The value is normally 16mm. A 16.5mm long surcharge can be found (Lowe) which is much scarcer. Lower says that there are three types of surcharges applied a) in apirs, b) in strips of three and c) in rows of six (both 16mm and 16.5mm).

A single copy of this surcharge is known on the 2d. but it sstatus has not been proved.
