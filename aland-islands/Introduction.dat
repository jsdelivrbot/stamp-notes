##\aland; Islands


I was curious to find out more about Aland stamps - as I am skeptical - of countries that issue topicals targetting the philatelic market. The \aland; Post Office Authority (Posten \aland;), firstly seems like a very efficient organization and the have been profitable for a few years.

Customers in Macau will be able to acquire \aland; stamps in the 
same way. Through this cooperation, both Macau and 
aland; Post 
aim at improving the circulation of their stamps and finding new 
markets, giving both posts a significant boost on a sagging stamp 
collecting market. 


The Macau Year Packs will be available to order 
from \aland; as of our ordering catalogue 2-2010 as well as from 
the Post's web shop on the Internet. Why not take the opportunity 
to acquaint yourself with a new country to collect?}}


This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of The \aland;.
The aland  form an archipelago in the Baltic Sea that is an autonomous, Swedish language speaking, region of Finland.

In the 1600s, \aland; was part of the kingdom of Sweden, a fast growing great power in need of efficient communications between the different regions 
of the kingdom. In consequence, a detailed postal 
decree was carried through in 1636. The Kingdom wished to secure the delivery of the mail but without facing the cost of wages.

The mail route across \aland; was established in 
1638. Until the end of the 19th century, the 
conveyance of mail across \aland; bore the stamp of 
the postal reform. The mail was conveyed in relays 
between farmers living at a certain distance from 
one another along the mail route. Mail farmers 
had many responsibilities and, in return, they were 
exempted from some of the taxes to the Crown. 
They were required to be able to read and write; 
another requirement was that each farmer must 
keep two farmhands to help him. The mail must be 
carried in all weathers and at all times

\aland; has its own postal administration but still uses the Finnish five-digit postal code system, using the number range 22000-22999, with the prefix AX. The lowest numbered postal code is for the capital Mariehamn, AX 22100, and the highest AX 22950 for Jurmo.
