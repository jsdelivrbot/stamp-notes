with 1 CENT on 1k, tied by Shanghai Post Russe 11.1.18 cds (T\&S type 6A), 
very fine \& scarce

Note: Owing to wartime depreciation of the rouble, in 1917 Russian stamps 
for use in China proper were surcharged (and payment required) in Chinese 
currency. This item shows, however, that stamps and stationery 
denominated in Russian currency were still accepted after 1917 
when supplied by the customer

2c on 2k, 3c on 3k and 4c on 4k paying the foreign letter rate, tied by 
Shanghai 16.5.19 cds (T\&S type 8C), a very fine and neat cover.

NOTE: From the beginning the Russian P.O.s in China had accepted payment 
in Chinese currency at a rate of 1c for 1k. Russian money was also accepted. 
However, after the Revolution of 1917 there followed a heavy depreciation in 
the Rouble which led the Postal Administration to insist on payment in 
Chinese currency only, hence the surcharged set of stamps in Chinese 
cents and dollars.
