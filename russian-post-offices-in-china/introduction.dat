\chapter{Russian Post Offices in China}  

Early Russian explorers, explored the vast areas of Outer Mongolia and Turkestan in the
early part of the ninenteeth century. These were followed by merchants, traders
and diplomats who set trading posts and open diplomatic negotiations for concessions
and priviledges. At the turn of the century concessions were secured from the Chinese
authorities in Eastern China.

Russia attempted to protect its interests in China via military force which led
into a collission and war with Imperial Japan. The Russo-Japanese War was fought
out in Manchuria between 1904-5. The outcome of the War shuttered Russia's ambitions
for domination of the Far East. After the delibitating effects of the Great War
(1914-17) and the Russian Revolution (1917-21) Imperial Russia was dissolved and saw
the closure of its Post Offices in China.


The first offices were in Beijing, Kalgan, Tientsin, and Urga (in Mongolia),
all in areas near to Russian-controlled territory. In November 1886 additional
offices opened in Shanghai, Chefoo, Hankow with offices in Port Arthur, and
Dairen following soon afterwards. In addition, many Russian Field Post Offices
operated throughout Manchuria and civilian mail was frequently accepted there
as well. Finally, the Chinese Eastern Railway had Russian post offices operating at
most of the major stations, and important cities along the railway such as Harbin
had several Russian post offices in the town itself. In addition,
Travelling Post Offices operated in trains along the Chinese Eastern Railway.


Stamps

Initially, the offices used the regular stamps of Russia, but in 1899, they
received stamps overprinted with "KITAI" (Russian for China) in Cyrillic script.
This overprint was applied to all types of stamps up to 1916, including the
varieties on horizontally laid, vertically laid, and wove paper. The overprint
was also applied to postal stationery envelopes, postcards, letter cards and newspaper wrappers. The overprint itself was in black, blue, or red, generally being chosen to contrast with the stamp colors. Most of these types are commonly available today (less than one US$); the most problematic is the blue overprint on the 14-kopeck wove paper variety, whose existence has been questioned.
Although the offices had always accepted Chinese currency at par, a Chinese cent being considered equivalent to a kopeck, in 1917 the overprint was changed to clarify the situation, simply consisting of the value in Chinese money and using Latin letters. The valuation was still one-to-one. A later round of overprints, in 1920, changed to use a horizontal overprint in mixed case, but these saw little use, all Russian post offices in China being closed in that year.

\subsection{Russian Merchant's Post}

The Russian Merchants' (or Mongolian) Post was a private
enterprise under the protection of the Russian Government initiated
in 1865, about 10 years before the official Russian Post was established
in Mongolia and China. A charge for its service was levied on incoming mail,
payable by the recipient. From January 1872 such mail received the 
standard "Doplatit" (to pay) hs.

\subsection{Earliest Known Cover}
The Russian post offices in China were a collection of post offices 
established by Imperial Russia in various cities
of China beginning in 1870.
