10010	TIENTSIN: 1905 Cover sent registered to Germany franked on the reverse
with "KITAI" 20k tied by Tientsin 23.3.05 cds (Tchilinghirian type 5A), 
and franked on the obverse with War Charity 10k and 3k that were 
ignored by the P.O. as a philatelic embellishment, with the 10k tied only 
by the encircled "dotted R" hs, registered label adjacent, Troitskosavsk 
transit indicating that it was not sent by the Trans-Siberian railway 
via Manchuria (as it was closed during the Russo-Japanese War), very unusual.
Note: The War Charity issue was not distributed to the P.O.s in China.
