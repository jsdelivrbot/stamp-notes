\subsection{Russian Merchant's Post}

The Russian Merchants' (or Mongolian) Post was a private
enterprise under the protection of the Russian Government initiated
in 1865, about 10 years before the official Russian Post was established
in Mongolia and China. A charge for its service was levied on incoming mail,
payable by the recipient. From January 1872 such mail received the 
standard "Doplatit" (to pay) hs.
