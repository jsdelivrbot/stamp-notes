\chapter{Kalgan}
Zhangjiakou (Kalgan) is a 
water-scarce city was historically the chief northern gate in the Great Wall 
to China for Europeans travelling along the Tea Road (such as Ivan Petlin (1619)[1] 
or Nicolae Milescu).

In August 1211, there raised the Badger's Mount Campaign, Genghis Khan 90,000 
strong force destroyed the 450,000 strong Jin Dynasty army.
In the 19th century, the town was the seat of a very extensive transit trade. 
In early autumn long lines of camels would come in from all quarters for the conveyance of the tea chests from Zhangjiakou, the Kalgan, to Kyakhta; and each caravan usually made three journeys in the winter. 
Some Russian merchants had permanent residences and warehouses just outside the gate.
In October 1909, Kalgan was connected by railway with Peking. 
The 1911 Encyclop\ae dia Britannica noted that, in Kalgan, 
"the ordinary houses have an unusual appearance, from the fact 
that they are mostly roofed with earth and become covered with green-sward" 
and that "on the way to Peking the road passes over a beautiful bridge of 
seven arches, ornamented with marble figures of animals".

In 1937 the Japanese occupied the region and made Kalgan the capital of the 
autonomous Cha-nan (South Chahar) Province. The Federated Mengjiang 
Commission was set up to supervise the economic affairs, banking, 
communications, and industry of Japanese-occupied Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang).

In the early 1960s at the height of Sino-Soviet tensions, Zhangjiakou 
was considered one of the most important cities in China for military 
strategy reasons. Zhangjiakou was aptly nicknamed, "Beijing's Northern Door", 
because whoever controlled Zhangjiakou was in a good position to either attack 
(in the case of the Soviets) or defend (in the case of the Chinese) Beijing.
