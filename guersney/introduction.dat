## Guersney


The first postage stamps marked Guernsey were issued during the occupation of the island by the Germans during World War II.[1]

Later, Guernsey used British regional stamps marked specifically for use in Guernsey but valid for postage throughout the United Kingdom.[1]

Guernsey has issued its own stamps since 1 October 1969.[1]
Starting in 2015, Guernsey also issues Post & Go stamps
