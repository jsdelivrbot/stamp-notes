# 1863 Seventh Issue of Bremen Postage Stamps


On April 29th, 1863, a new value, 2
grote, was issued this being for the
single letter rate between Bremen and
Vegesack. 

\ph[60%]{../bremen/871.jpg}{}

The design shows the
usual '"key" in the centre within a
pearled oval which in turn is surrounded
by a broad engine-turned
oval band. This band is inscribed
"BREMEN" at top and "ZWEI
GROTE" at foot. The large oval is
enclosed by a rectangular frame
inscribed "STADT" at left, "POST" at
top, and "AMT" at right. In each of
the corners the numeral "2" is shown
on a small shield and the spandrels are
filled with ornamentation. This value
was lithographed in orange varying a
good deal in shade and, like the 10
grote, was never issued in imperforate
condition.
