THE SIXTH ISSUE.
In 1862 the 3gr, 5gr and 5sgr were issued
with the perces en scie roulettes but the
7gr, for which there was only a small
demand, is not known in that condition.
The 3gr, like the imperf. variety is
found on laid paper while the other two
values are on wove paper. The same
types of the 3gr and 5gr exist for
the original stones were used.
