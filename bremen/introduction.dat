\chapter{Introduction}


The three Hanse cities ([Hamburg](../hamburg/Introduction), Bremen and [Lübeck](../lubeck/Introduction)) issued their own stamps, as did the Grand Duchies of [Baden](../baden/Introduction), [Oldenburg](../oldenburg/Introduction), Hessen and Mecklenburg-Schwerin.Also the Duchy of [Brunswick](../brunswick) and the Kingdoms of [Hannover](../hanover/Introduction), [Prussia](../prussia/Introduction), [Bavaria](../bavaria/Introduction), [Württemberg](../wurttemberg/Introduction) and [Saxony](../saxony/Introduction).

The town of Bremen owes its origin
to a bishopric founded in 788 by Charlemagne.
Tiring of the episcopal yoke it
joined the Hanseatic league in the thirteenth
century, this league being a confederation
of German towns founded
for mutual protection and for the promotion
of commercial advantages.

Bremen seems to have been a somewhat
troublesome member of the league for
it was several times expelled and readmitted.

By the sixteenth century it
was in a highly prosperous condition
and despite numerous vicissitudes since
it has retained its prosperity. Bremen
is situated at the mouth of the Weser
and embraces within its boundaries two
other towns Bremerhaven and Vegesack.
Its modern commercial prosperity
dates from the founding of Bremerhaven
in 1830, this port being only second
to Hamburg. It is one of the shipowning
ports of Germany and has a
mercantile fleet of over 600 vessels
(with a tonnage in excess of 700,000)
including the fleet of the North German
Lloyd, whose headquarters are
here. Its most striking edifice is the
cathedral, dating from the llth century,
and the town hall is also an imposing
structure. It has many important industries
and at the present time its
population numbers about 170,000.

The town of Bremen is the capital of
the free state of that name, a state having
an area of 99 square miles and a population
of about 230,000. It sends one
representative to the Imperial Diet and
has one vote in the Imperial Council.

The state forms a democratic republic
governed by a senate of sixteen elected
members (the excutive) presided over
by two burgomasters elected for four
years, and an assembly of 150 citizens
(the legislative). In 1810 it was annexed
by France, but three years later
recovered its independence and joined
the Germanic Confederation, subsequently
the North German Confederation, and
finally was merged in the German
Empire.

## Postal history

The philatelic history of Bremen is short and uneventful. Its few stamps have, seemingly, never been so extensively written of as, for instance, those of Bergedorf though they are full of interest and much still remains to be discovered regarding the make-up of the
sheets, the dates of issue of the manypronounced shades, etc. Though the
second in importance of the three Hanseatic
towns of Hamburg, Bremen, and
Lubeck, Bremen was the first to employ
postage stamps. Its first stamp was
issued on April 10th, 1855 and was purely
for local use. In 1856 a 5gr stamp
was issued for use on letters to Hamburg;
in 1860 a 7gr stamp appeared this
being intended for prepayment of the
rate to Lubeck and Mecklenburg-
Schwerin; and in the following year a
5sgr value was issued for prepayment of
the ship-rate on letters to England.
Shortly afterwards a lOgr label made
its appearance, this being to prepay the
single letter rate to Holland. This
value was rouletted and in the following
year new supplies of the denominations
already referred to were also
issued in this condition instead of imperf.
as previously. In 1863 a reduction
in the local rate made a 2gr stamp
necessary and while no new values appeared
all were issued in 1867 perforated.
On January 1st, 1868, Bremen
joined the North German Confederation
and its special stamps were retired
in favor of the set for general use within
the Confederation. It will be noted
from foregoing notes that all the stamps
of Bremen were issued for local use or
for some special purpose. What we
may term outside correspondence was
forwarded through post-offices established
in the town by Hanover, Prussia,
and Thurn and Taxis, the stamps of
those offices being used.

The different currencies in use in
Germany at that date must have caused
considerable confusion, and that of Bremen
appears to have been distinct from
all the others. Though the reichsthaler,
or < thaler, was the standard coin over
part of Northern Germany, it was split
up into 72 grote in Bremen, and into 24
gutegroschen of 12 pfennige each in
Brunswick and Hanover. Eleven grote
was considered equivalent to 5 silbergroschen
of Prussia so that the stamp of
lowest denomination, the 2 grote, was
worth a little less than 1 silbergroschen.
The reichsthaler was worth about 78c at
that period so that 1 grote was equivalent
to a fraction over 1c.
