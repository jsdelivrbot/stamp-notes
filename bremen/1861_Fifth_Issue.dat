THE FIFTH ISSUE.
On the same day that the 5sgr stamp
was issued a 10 grote stamp was placed
in circulation for prepayment of the
single letter rate to the Netherlands.
This stamp was lithographed in black on
white wove paper, the design showing
the "key" on a vertically lined oval within
a double framing, the inner one resembling
engine turned work, and the outer
one, containing the inscriptions, being
composed of lines crossing each other
diagonally, the frame making an irregularly
shaped oval. The inscriptions consist
of "BREMEN" in the upper part
and "ZEHN GROTE" in the lower.

In each of the four corners are the
numerals "10" on small flat ovals of
solid color. It is interesting to note
that in all genuine specimens there is an
error of engraving in the upper left
corner, the lines of the ground of the
outer frame extending over the exterior
white lines of the frame. 

It is curious
that this stamp is not known imperforate, though issued on the same day as
the 5sgr, but was rouletted in the style
known as perces en scie, which made
incisions something like the teeth of a
saw in shape, gauging 16. There was
only one type for this value and the
stamps had dividing lines between them
on the sheet.
