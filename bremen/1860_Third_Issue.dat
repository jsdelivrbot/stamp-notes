# 1860 Third Issue


It was not until July 10th, 1860, that
another value was issued. This was the
7 grote issued for defraying the rate
of postage to Lubeck and Mecklenburg-
Schwerin. Correspondence in this direction
could not have been very large
for the 7gr used is a very scarce variety.

The design is very similar to that of the
5gr with the value at base expressed as
"Sieben Grote." There is but one type
of this value and, like the 5gr, there are
dividing lines between the stamps on
the sheet. A small mark, evidently
quite accidental in origin though it was
at one time dignified by the term "secretdot,"
appears on all the genuine stamps.

This is a small colored dot which appears
just below the center of the upright
stroke of the "k" of "Marke."
