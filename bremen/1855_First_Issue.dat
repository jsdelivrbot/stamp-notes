The first stamp was issued on April
10th, 1855, its facial value being 3 grote
and it was intended for franking letters
within the town, including Bremerhaven
and Vegesack. The stamps were litho-
31
graphed in Bremen, the design showing
the Arms (a key) on a shield surmounted
by a crown, with "STADT
POST AMT." (town post administration)
above, and "BREMEN" below. On
each side of the shield is a large numeral
"3", in shaded figures within an oval,
richly ornamented with scroll work, and
in each of the angles is a small uncolored
"3" on a solid colored ground.
The key is emblematic of the independence
of the once free city for as Mr.
Overy Taylor wrote in the Stamp Collector's
Magazine (vol. IX p. 164) : "The
Bremen burgesses kept the key of their
own door, instead of giving it into the
custody of some neighbouring potentate,
and knew how to maintain their independence
long after other equally important
towns had succumbed."


The stamps were printed in black on
dull greyish-blue paper of moderate
thickness, gummed with a white gum
thinly applied. The paper is laid and
the laid lines may be found running
both horizontally or vertically, the latter
being a little the rarer unused and
much rarer used.

This 3 grote stamp was, as we have
already stated, produced by lithography.
Three drawings were made of the design
each differing in small particulars
from the others. These three types appear
side by side repeated throughout
the sheet, which consisted of twelve horizontal
rows of six stamps each as follows
:
