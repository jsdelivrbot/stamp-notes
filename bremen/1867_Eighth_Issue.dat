# 1867 Eighth Issue


The two grote was the last stamp to
be issued and no fu ther changes were
made until 1867 when all six values
were placed in circulation perforated 13,
the perforation evidently being the work
of a single lined machine. 

The 3gr is on laid paper as before, all the others
being on wove. The dividing lines were
removed from the stone of the 7gr and
though the lines remained on the other
values they did not always print distinctly.

Most of the values of this set
are considerably rarer used than unused
for not only did they have a very short
life, but, as we shall show later, a
number of remainders came on the market
in 1868.

At the end of 1867 the post-office of
Bremen ceased to exist as a separate
administration, and from January 1st
1868 formed part of the North German
Confederation. The remaining stamps
in stock, comprising a large quantity of
the perforated stamps, some of the 5gr
and 5sgr imperforate, and a few lOgr
rouletted were subsequently sold. The
only item I can trace bearing on the
disposal of the remainders is a parafraph
in the Monthly Journal for
une, 1903, viz:

About the same date (December,
1868) Mr. Van Rinsum, of Amsterdam,
passing through Bremen, purchased
the whole stock of stamps
there, for cash down, at the high price
of 5 thalers ! At least that is what
I have been told. We may suppose
that this was not such a bad bargain
for Mr. Van Rinsum.
