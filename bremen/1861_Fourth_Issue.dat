THE FOURTH ISSUE.
On December 13th, 1861, a stamp of
5sgr was issued to prepay the ship rate
to Great Britain. In design, color, and
workmanship this is certainly the best
of all the Bremen issues. In the center
is the usual key (but without the crown)

on an oval of solid color with a richly
ornamented border. The rectangular
frame, which is also very ornate, contains
the name "BREMEN" at the top,
and the value "5 Sgr" at the base between
small circles containing the
Roman number "V". There is only one
type of this stamp. Why the value was
expressed as 5 silbergroschen instead of
11 grote it is difficult to say. The silbergroschen
was not a Bremen coin
but the term may have been used because
this was the Prussian and Hanoverian
rate to England. 

This value is found in
several distinct shades of green and, unused,
is commonest on thick paper.
