## British Postal Agencies

British Postal Agencies (POA) are known to have existed from the early 1800's to the late
1850's in Madeira, islands, Canary Islands and Cape Verde Islands. There is not much information about them
and material appears irregularly in the market.

### Madeira Islands

### Canary islands

### Cape Verde Islands

This group of islands belonging to Portugal are about 350 miles west of Cape Verde. The Chief Town was Porto
Praya. St Vincent. was an important coaling station and was also where the Postal Agency was located.
