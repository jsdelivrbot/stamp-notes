The West African Frontier Force (WAFF) was a multi-battalion field force, formed by the British Colonial Office in 1900 to garrison the West African colonies of Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Gambia. In 1928 it received royal patronage, becoming the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF).

The decision to raise this force was taken in 1897 because of concern at French colonial 
expansion in territories bordering on Northern Nigeria. The first troops were from 
that area and thought of by the British as "Hausas" and to the end of colonial rule the 
Hausa language was a lingua franca in a very multi-tribal force, especially in Nigeria. 
The task of raising the new locally recruited force was entrusted to Colonel F.D. Lugard 
who arrived in Nigeria in 1898. The following year an interdepartmental committee 
recommended the amalgamation of all existing British colonial military forces in 
West Africa under the designation of the West African Field Force.
