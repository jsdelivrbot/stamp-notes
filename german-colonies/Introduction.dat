# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of the German Colonies 

The earliest instance we have of German colonisation dates back to January, 1683, when the Elector, Frederic William
of Brandenburg, the so-called "Great-Elector," bought from native chiefs a small territory on the Coast of Guinea, hoisted the Brandenburg flag, and built the Fort Friedrichsburg, of which small ruins are still in existence. This possession, however, was sold in 1718 by the grandson of the Great Elector, Frederic
William I, second King of Prussia, to the Dutch government for 7,200 ducats
($9,400) and twelve slaves, as he was unable to hold it against Holland without a
strong fleet.

But it was two hundred years later before colonial expansion began to be a serious affair with Germany. For several years after the establishment of the Empire, Bismarck and others worked hard at its internal consolidationâ€”witness, among other things, the codification
of all the conflicting laws of Germany, a gigantic work lasting nearly thirty years.

No sooner had the imposing edifice of the Reich been fairly riveted within and without, than the national energy began to seek an outlet in the creation of a Germany beyond the seas. For years Bismarck had been indifferent, and indeed, positively averse, to colonial adventure;but at last he could no longer resist a popular impulse which was rapidly growing in strength. The result was, that within a year or two of this new departure, in 1884, Germany found herself included in the ranks of the colonial powers, with territories in Africa, New Guinea and the Pacific Archipelago, aggregating an area five times the size of her empire in Europe, though nine-tenths
of this area is in Africa.

Germany may thus be said to have become an oversea power without becoming a colonial one in the British sense. It has been wittily and truly said, that France has colonies and no colonists; Germany, colonists and no colonies; while Britain had both colonies and colonists.

It was too late in the day, as indicated by the world's clock, when Germany
entered the colonial field, for by this time all the available waste spaces of the earth had already been appropriated by other powers. What she wanted was to found a new Germany, a new Fatherland across the sea for the accommodation of those vast numbers of her
surplus sons who had hitherto migrated
to America and other Anglo-Saxon
lands; but it soon became apparent that
none of the African territories which
had now fallen to her were at all suitable
for this purpose.

They were all sub-tropical, and fitted
only to be plantation, not agricultural,
colonies. Very small was the total number
of Germans who went to seek their
fortunes in the German colonies, and
even of these, a large proportion were
government officials employed to administer
the protectorates without having
first learned the very necessary art of
ruling native races. The brusque manners
of Prussian policemen and the
brutal methods of some German drill
sergeants were unsuited to the black
tribes of the Kamerun and Damaraland.
Rebellion was frequent, and even the
German army, boasted at that time as
being the best in Europe, was for several
years powerless to put down a native
rising in South West Africa involving
the loss of thousands of German
lives and millions of money.

For some years after the establishment of the various colonies, ordinary German stamps without surcharge were used. Then followed German stamps overprinted with the names of the respective colonies, to be followed in turn by a set of the stereotyped "ship" design inscribed with the name of the colony issuing them. The stamps are all so much alike that they are rather lacking in interest, the constant repetition of the same designs being very monotonous.
