The best catalogue listing is provided by the Sassone catalogue. According to the Sassone catalogue between 1903 and 1941 Somalia issued some 400 stamps; additionally some 24 unissued stamps are also listed bringing the grand total to 424 stamps. Somalia was one of the most prolific stamp issuing colony, second only to the Aegean islands and Rhodes with their 559 stamps. This is in great part due to the high number of back-of-the-book issues whichinclude the highest number of parcel post stamps (71) and postage dues (64) of all colonies and territories.
