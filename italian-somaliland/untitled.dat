\chapter{World War II}

The war years began with the Italian invasion (1940) of British Somaliland, but in the following year Lord Wavell carried out a retaliatory maneuver and was able t overrun Italian Somaliland.

On 13 April 1942 the first stamps of Great Britain were issued in Somalia. These were the five dark coloured low value definitives (Sass. 1-5) overprinted M.E.F. (Middle East Forces). At the beginning of 1943 these stamps were replaced by a longer series overprinted E.A.F. (East Africa Forces) to be followed by a further series overprinted B.M.A. Somalia (British Military Administration Somalia) in May 1948. In January 1950 the M. was dropped from B.M.A. It is possible that the dark coloured stamps with the much less common Nairobi version of M.E.F. overprint had occassional use in Somalia as well as those with the M.E.F. applied to the lower value definitives in the lighter colours (Sass. 6-13).

Great Britain administered Italian Somaliland until 1950 when it was handed back to Italy on a ten year mandate from the United Nations (Somalia A.F.I.S.). Preparations for independence were set in motion during the 1950s, both in British Somaliland and the former Somalia Italiana. Full independence was given to the British colony on 26 June 1960; on July 1st it joined with the former Italian part to create the Independent Somali Republic.
