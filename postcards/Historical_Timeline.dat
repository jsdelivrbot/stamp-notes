###A Brief Postcard Timeline

###1847  The United States issues its first postage stamp.

###1848-1860  The first known postcard in the United States is mailed. 

There are no official regulations regarding cards and they are treated as letters. Cards in mailed these years are basically aberrations.

###1861  Congress allows privately printed cards under one once to be sent through the mail. 

Postage rates varied by distance. John P. Charlton copyrights the first postcard but none are known to be sent.

###1869  The world's first official postal correspondence card is issued by Austria.

1870  Hymen L. Lipman reissues Charlton's card and it becomes the first privately authorized card to be used in the United States.

1873-1897  The United States issued its first official Postal Card. One side was reserved exclusively for the address, the other for a message, and it cost a penny to mail regardless of distance. Privately printed cards were still allowed but they required two cents postage if they carried anything but advertising. This was the same as letter rate making these cards unpopular.

1874  The Universal Postal Union was formed to replace individual treaties between nations with an accepted set of consistent regulations governing international mail. A standard postcard size of 3 1/2 by 5 1/2 inches was established.

1889  The first known color postcard is printed in Austria.

####1893  Exposition Cards

are issued on a large scale for the first time at Chicago Columbian Exposition. 

Their success prompts many others to begin publishing cards.
1893-1897  While a number of publishers begin to print exposition, souvenir, and mail cards, an economic depression hits the U.S. forcing many printers out of business. Most cards are imported from Europe instead where a postcard craze has begun.
1897-1900  Postal regulations allow for a large size Businessman's Card to be used for advertising. Many are die cut into shapes or are made with moving parts. These are forerunners to the novelty postcard.

####1898-1901  Congress authorized the use of the Private Mailing Card. 

It reduced the postage rate for all messages to a penny, but it had many size, color, and printing requirements. These restrictions forced many publishers out of the market, but the lower rates made these cards very popular and many others began to publish them.
1899  The first Real Photo Postcard is sent through the U.S. mail.

###1901  New regulations 

ended many of the restrictions required by Private Mailing Cards. In its place the privately printed Post Card was authorized. This brought more publishers into the postcard business. The images on postcards tended to become larger with only a small writing tab left to provided for a message. The first photo paper with a preprinted postcard back is put on the market enabling real photo postcards to be easily made.

###1902  Rural Free Delivery service is introduced bringing the convenience of mail to the majority of Americans who live outside of cities. This greatly increased the market for postcards. The world's first divided back postcard is issued in Great Britain.


1905-1909  The sale of postcards becomes a craze as they are sold in record amounts. Perhaps up to half their number are being purchased by collectors and many clubs are formed. With a large number of publishers and printers in the postcard business, cards are produced in a wide variety of forms using many different printing techniques. This time is often referred to a postcard's Golden Age.

1907  The United States issues its first Divided Back Postcard. This allows for the address and message to be placed on the same side of a card, leaving the other side entirely available for an image.

1909  Congress authorizes tariffs on imported postcards at the bequest of American printers. Since most cards sold in the U.S. were manufactured in Germany, many jobbers stocked up on as many cards as they could before the tariff went into effect. This produced a glut of cards depressing prices.

1912  As tariffs effectively cut off the supply of most postcards from Germany, American printers failed to match their quality and quantity and demand quickly diminished ending the craze. As postcards were dumped on the market, prices fell to an all time low forcing 25 percent of publishers out of business.

1913  The French fold greeting card is introduced replacing postcards in popularity.

1914-1918  The First World War restricts the use of materials for postcards curtailing production in Europe and further limiting imports to the United States. Cards are still produced to keep up morale and as instruments of propaganda, but many printers close due to shortages or war damage. The war also creates a worldwide shortage of printing ink as most is manufactured in Germany.

1917-1919  Restrictions are placed on materials for postcard production in the United States as it enters the war in Europe. A penny war tax is placed on postcard postage driving down its use.

1920-1928  Post war material shortages initially plague the printing industry but postcard production picks up as the economy booms. Publishers producing cards with a White Border are most common but not inclusive to these years.

1925-1928  The postage for postcards is raised to two cents. It dramatically cuts down on their use but is repealed due to its unpopularity.

1928-1941  The Great Depression hits slowing postcard production and sales. This time was dominated by cards that were cheaper to produce such as monochromes, hand colored cards, and the new linens.

1931  Curt Teich begins printing postcards on Linen textured stock allowing cards to be printed with brighter dye based inks on high speed presses. Many other publishers follow his lead.

1934   New inks are introduced that render CYMK colors for the first time. As they begin to be used in commercial work, tricolor printing evolves into process printing. This sets the stage for the production of modern Photochrome postcards.
1938  Kodachrome, the first practical color transparency film was refined from from the version first released two years earlier. Color separation can now be easily made to reproduce natural color and modern Photochrome (Chrome) cards begin to be published a year later. It is initially seen as a fad and only produced in limited numbers.

1941-1945  Material restrictions are imposed once again on postcard production as the United States entered the Second World War. Postcards were still produced to keep up moral and for propaganda.

1946  Interest in old postcards began to rise as scholarly writings on them began to appear. A new generation of clubs began to form, the first of which was the Metropolitan Post Card Collectors Club in New York City.

1952  The Penny Postcard reached its end as the mailing rate was raised to two cents once again. Only this time the price would continually go up.

1956  Photochromes, which had steadily grown in number in the post war years, had completely replace linen postcards by this time to become the dominant format. Postcards would now be produced by offset lithography wholly by mechanical means without the need for retouchers, giving all cards a uniform look.

1970  While 4 by 6 inch Continental sized cards could be found in Europe before WWII, they began to become popular in the United States at this time and are now in stiff competition with standard sized postcards.

1984  The first full week of May in the United States and United Kingdom was declared National Postcard Week.

1993  Digital offset printing is introduced bypassing the need to work with film. Email becomes available to the public and eCards begin to replace the traditional printed card. Coupled with growing cell phone use, printed postcards are now purchased largely as souvenirs.

1995  Although based on earlier forms of giveaway cards, the free Rack Card becomes popular and they begin to be acquired by collectors.
