\chapter{1967 Independent Anguilla Overprints} 

According to an announcement made by the Anguilla Postmaster in 1967, on instructions
given by the Government of Anguilla, The Island Press Inc. of St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin 
Islands, overstamped the entire stock of St. Christopher Nevis Anguilla Postage stamps
held in Anguilla.

The stamps were overprinted "Independent Anguilla" and the words "St. Christopher Nevis Anguilla" 
were blocked out. The background to the printing including the discovery of forgeries and the 
succesful arrest and prosecution of a forger was published in the BWIS Journal by R. C. Coleman.

\ph[30%]{../anguilla/1967-60c.jpg}{The rarest stamp of the issue, as only 100 stamps were
overprinted. A copy at a Gartner Auction auction in Germany, in June 2013 had an estimate of \euro3000.}

The stamps were placed on sale at the Anguillan Post Office on 4th September 1967.

## History of the 1967 Overprints 

Technical details of the stamps involved:- the complete Definitive issue of St. 
Kitts, Nevis & Anguilla, Scott # 145 to 160: S.G.129 to 144. Issued 30th November, 
1963: designed by Victor Whiteley; printed by Harrison & Sons in England by the 
Photogravure process. 

Overprint details:- Inspired by the London Stamp Dealers, Messrs. John Lister & 
Co. Ltd. and whose Director, Mr. John King, became responsible for co-ordinating the 
work involved - made all the more difficult due to the limited facilities available in the 
area for this kind of printing. Subsequently, Mr. King, accompanied by Anguilla's 
Chief Executive. Mr. Ronald Webster, flew to the island of St. Thomas, in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands and the order was placed with the ISLAND PRESS INC., using linotype 
supplied by the HOME JOURNAL, a St. Thomas 'daily.'

Mr. William Bracken, the Island Press Manager, was in charge of the work, and 
which he later described as "a very difficult job." In all, 1,431 sheets of 25 stamps were 
involved and two settings of 25 were set-up, one for the horizontal and the other for the 
vertical formats. Two or three sheets were spoiled with inaccurate placings of the 
overprint and to avoid further problems all remaining sheets were stripped of their 
margins - thus no stamps exist with margins on any side or position. In all, nine sheets 
were spoilt during the process and these included two of the nine only panes of $5 and 
which received inverted overprints. All nine sheets were destroyed in the presence of 
Bracken, King and Webster. The work complete, the stamps were handed to Mr. 
Webster and he and Mr. King returned to Anguilla. They were put on sale on 
September 4th, 1967. The stamps were not sold over the counter in the normal way; 
one handed the letter or letters, along with the cash, to the Postmaster, and the stamps 
were affixed by the P.O. staff. This precluded trade speculative buying. 
Overprint FORGERY details:- Forger:- . . . Richardson (full name omitted in 
fairness to him, in that he was prosecuted and subsequently paid his debt to society). 
St. Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla are full of 'Richardsons,' thus identity is obscure. 

 NOTES AND QUERIES4 
ANGUILLA (Cont.) 

PRINTER:- the firm involved was located in another West Indian island but the name 
was not disclosed to me; whether or not, they were prosecuted I do not, and never will 
know. STAMPS:- as it was illegal to use or import St. Kitts stamps into Anguilla after 
the secession, these must have been bought in St. Kitts and taken straight to the printer 
for overprinting. The total number of sets involved is not known but thought not to 
exceed thirty. 

I first became aware of the forgery through a friend of mine on the island of 
Martinique: I promised never to involve him in the matter and therefore he will be 
identified as 'John Smith,' the British equivalent to the American 'John Doe.' John 
Smith employed a great number of Anguillans in his business and, without being a 
collector, he started to buy Anguilla overprints from members of his staff as they 
arrived on the incoming mail. By mail (I have never met him), I advised him on what 
to pay for the various values offered and also on what to look for in damaged copies, 
etc. We even exchanged and both benefited considerably by, being able to complete 
short sets through this medium. Around the end of March in 1969, John Smith wrote to 
me that he had been offered a complete set of the overprints in MINT condition, was 
enclosing them and were they "all right." He did not feel quite happy about them, but 
his experience was such that he thought it best to seek professional advice. They were 
most certainly not "all right," this was my first sight of the forgeries. They were 
pathetic and it amazed me that John Smith, who had bought quite a number of them. 

had then not noticed the so-obvious error, in that, the printer had placed ALL the 
values, whether horizontal or vertical in format, in a vertical position for overprinting. 
Thus only the Â½, 2, 3, 15, 25, 60, $1 and $5 values, received the correct overprint. The 
blacking-out process had been badly done in Indian ink and in fact, the effort was so 
poor as to be ridiculous. However, I realised that if John Smith had not noticed the real 
error, the stamps constituted a positive danger to an investor and non-collector. 

 Original Forgery Corrected Forgery 
I wrote to John Smith, told him the truth and asked him to tell Richardson that I had 
sent the stamps to London in order to get a good price for him, meantime, could I have 
a further set to send to London. My purpose in requesting a second set was to check if 
the printer's error was constant. In due time, two more sets arrived and John Smith 
advised me that he would not mention to Richardson that we had discovered the 
forgery. The first of the two sets subsequently received was identical with the originals 
inspected and returned by me, but the second set amazed me. 5 

The printer had corrected his original mistake and the blacking-out had been done with 
great care. The type used in ALL the stamps, that is the three sets I had under 
inspection, was dangerously close to the genuine overprint and would fool even an 
experienced collector unless he had been previously warned. This proved to me quite 
clearly that we had on our hands very passable forgeries of the overprints and that 
action must be taken. 

I did not wish to cause panic among Anguillan collectors and, perhaps for all time, 
damage the image the island of Anguilla had created among collectors and thus I 
decided to report it to Mr. Harrigan, the Postmaster at the Valley P.O. In turn, he 
brought it to the notice of Mr. Webster, the Chief Executive and it was agreed that I 
would not mention it to anybody until given the green light. In the end, it was decided 
to call in Scotland Yard and on April 26th, 1969, I received a letter from Mr. Harrigan 
thus: 

" ...... Further to my last letter I have had a discussion with Detective Inspector 
O'Hara who came to see me to-day. Up to now this matter has been treated in a 
most confidential manner. Mr. O'Hara has asked me to let you know that he will be 
coming to St. Thomas on Wednesday to have a talk with you. He would be grateful 
therefore if you would arrange for him to meet you in office . . . . . " (This being 
the F.B.I. Office in St. Thomas) - my note). 

I subsequently met the Scotland Yard man who admitted that he was ignorant on 
philatelic matters and I thus provided him with all the evidence he would need to prove 
his case, once the man was arrested. I handed over to him the stamps from the original 
set and explained, quite truthfully, that the other stamps had gone to London to be 
photographed in the interests of Postal History and this was eventually undertaken by a 
Professional, who produced first class prints in both black and white and in full colour. 
I heard later that Richardson had been picked-up, charged and pleaded guilty to the 
charge. In view of his co-operation with Scotland Yard, he was not sent to prison, 
being fined, I seem to remember, around $250. (E.C.C.).
