\section{Slovenia}

Many people confuse [Slovakia](../slovakia/introduction) with Slovenia. 
Slovenia is a country in Central Europe touching the Alps and bordering the Mediterranean. Slovenia borders Italy on the west, the Adriatic Sea on the southwest, Croatia on the south and east, Hungary on the northeast, and Austria on the north. The capital and largest city of Slovenia is Ljubljana. Slovenia covers an area of 20,273 square kilometres and has a population of over 2 million. The majority of the population speaks Slovene which is also the country's official language. Other local official languages are Hungarian and Italian.

\subsection{Up to 1918}

Slovenia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918 when it became part of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

Stamps were issued specifically for Slovenia, including the well known "chainbreakers" series, until Slovenia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929.[1][2]

\subsection{World War II}

On 8 July 1941 the Germans annexed parts of Slovenia, as Lower Styria, extending south to the River Sava and German stamps were used. Italy later occupied the rest of Slovenia as the Province of Lubiana. In September 1943 Italy ended hostilities with the allies and the Germans took over Lubiana, renaming it the Province of Laibach. Stamps were issued by both countries, most of which were overprints on existing stamps.[1]


\subsection{Post war}

In 1945 Slovenia became a part of Yugoslavia and used their stamps until 1991-92.[1]


\subsection{Independent Slovenia}

The first stamp of independent Slovenia was issued on 26 June 1991. Yugoslav stamps were valid for postage in Slovenia until 25 April 1992.[1]
