# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of the Old German States

German States stamps, prior to the German Unification, were issued by the individual Germanic Kingdoms, Duchies, Free-Cities, etc.  The stamps for the British Protectorate of [Heligoland](../heligoland/Introduction) are also included in this category.

[Bavaria](../bavaria/Introduction) became the first state to issue postage stamps in 1849, and Saxony became the second state to issue postage stamps in 1850. The subsequent postage stamp issuing states were Baden, Bergedorf, Braunschweig, Bremen, Hamburg, Hannover, Heligoland, L端bek, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Prussia, Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, and W端rttemberg.

The House of Thurn and Taxis, while not a state, transported mail, and in 1852, they also began issuing their own postage stamps. Thurn and Taxis had existed, as a postal service for the European kingdoms, since 1497, when the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I, commissioned Franz von Taxis to establish a postal service to carry official mail.

When the northern German states joined in the North German Confederation in 1868, they discontinued their own postal services and became part of the North German Postal District, or Norddeutscher Postbezirk, in German.

After the German unification and the establishment of the empire in 1871, imperial postage stamps were issued, for use in all but two of the former German states.

Bavaria and W端rttemberg retained their postal authorities after the German unification.  Bavaria continued to issue postage and official stamps until 1920, and W端rttemberg continued to issue official stamps until 1923.
