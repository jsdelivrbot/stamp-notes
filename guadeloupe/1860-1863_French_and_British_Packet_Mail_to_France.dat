French Colonies Yvert #3, 5, 1859 40c 
Vermilion horizontal strips of three and 
four plus 10c Yellow bister horizontal pair, 
an impressive franking for the six times rate 
to France (6x50c = 3Fr), a few minor wrinkles 
to the stamps being affixed close to the edge of 
a large linen cover, all tied by lozenge of dots cancels, 
black "Pointe-a-Pitre/Guadeloupe/25 Oct 1860" rimless c.d.s., 
carried via British packet with black Calais entry transit and 
red boxed "PD" handstamp, Paris transit, backstamped Vannes, some deterioration to the paper on the linen in the bottom right corner, backflap missing, a fine and extremely rare multiple rate franking. (imagea) (Image)	 Est. $1,000-1,500

\subsection{Largest Recorded Multiple on cover of the 40c eagle}

\ph[80%]{../guadeloupe/39.jpg}{39 Fr. Colonies Yvert #5	French Colonies Yvert #5, 1859 40c Vermilion block of twenty being a full two horizontal rows of the sheet with large sheet margins at each side (affixed over edge of cover at one end), plus a strip of four and one stamp lost en route, a most amazing franking being the largest recorded multiple of the 40c on a cover from Guadeloupe, its usage is equally amazing starting out as a 20 times the 50c rate to Paris with stamps tied by lozenge cancels, black "Pointe-a-Pitre/Guadeloupe/28 Aout 1862" rimless c.d.s., carried via British packet with black Calais entry transit, red boxed "PD" handstamp, backstamped Paris and then forwarded back across the Atlantic to Mexico, in addition to the largely missing stamp there is a piece missing to one stamp and a few other faults in the bottom row of the block, edge wear to cover, not surprising when one considers the size and travels of this envelope, fine; a rare and important postal history rarity of the Eagle issue used in Guadeloupe.
