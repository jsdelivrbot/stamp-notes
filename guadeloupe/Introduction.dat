\chapter{Guadeloupe}

Guadeloupe, an overseas colony of France has been using stamps since 1894. It originally used French Colonies stamps overprinted with \textsc{G.P.E} or \textsc{GUADELOUPE}. By 1905, however, stamps were being printed for Guadeloupe.

Possibly the best source of information on the Postal History of Guadeloupe is the Edward J.J. Grabowski Collection of Guadeloupe Postal History. The collection was sold in December 12, 2007 by Spink Shreves..

There is no question the Edward Grabowski's collection of Guadeloupe postal history is the finest collection ever formed of this interesting Caribbean nation. For well over twenty years he has scoured the philatelic world for covers which ultimately evolved into an exhibition that paints an extraordinary picture of Guadeloupe's fascinating and elusive postal history. And for his efforts his collection was awarded philately's highest exhibiting accolade - the Grand Prix d'Honneur - at the Washington 2006 International Stamp Show.

Mr. Grabowski's collection begins with a  selection of covers using France's first adhesive stamps - including the earliest documented cover used from any of the four countries in which these stamps were introduced. The collection continues with a stunning array of different 19th century overseas and domestic usages. In featuring the stamps of the General French Colonies and the early provisional overprints of Guadeloupe, he has amassed many beautiful and rare covers. Mr. Grabowski is particularly proud of his treatment of the postal history of the numerous small post offices on the islands and their dependencies.

Three values, the 10c, 25c and 1Fr Ceres first issue, were sent to these colonies to prepay the postage of 1Fr50c per 7.5 grams to France via England by British packet. Letters entered France from England via Calais. The stamps were applied in the colony, in this case Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe, but were not cancelled until they reached France.This small letter is a member of a tiny population of less than 50 covers recorded using French stamps from Guadeloupe. These stamps were only in use for approximately two years before their use was terminated and the experiment considered to be generally unsuccessful. The cover offered here is the earliest recorded use of French stamps, not just in Guadeloupe, but in all of the colonies in which they were placed in use. This cover is the premier cover of the French stamped covers of Guadeloupe and a great rarity that is indispensable for an award winning collection of this country; signed R. Calves and accompanied by a 1999 J. Robineau certificate; ex-Schatzkes.
