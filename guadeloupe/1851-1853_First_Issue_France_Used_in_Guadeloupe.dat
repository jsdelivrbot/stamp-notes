\chapter{French Stamps used in Guadeloupe}


Beginning in late 1851 through 1853 France initiated the trial use of the current first issue Ceres stamps of France in the four colonies of Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana and Reunion. Three values, the 10c, 25c and 1Fr Ceres first issue, were sent to these colonies to prepay the postage of 1Fr50c per 7.5 grams to France via England by British packet. Letters entered France from England via Calais.

The stamps were applied in the colony, in this case Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe, but were not cancelled until they reached France.
The small letter shown in Figure\ref{earliest} and posted on the 28 November 1851 is a member of a tiny population of less than 50 covers recorded\footnote{According to Spinks.} using French stamps from Guadeloupe. These stamps were only in use for approximately two years before their use was terminated and the experiment considered to be generally unsuccessful. The cover shown   is the earliest recorded use of French stamps, not just in Guadeloupe, but in all of the colonies in which they were placed in use.

The major purpose of issuing French stamps to Guadeloupe and the other colonies was to prepay the 1Fr50c rate to France for which the 25c and 1Fr values were sufficient. This is borne out by the fact that apparently the French officials believed that the stamps of a country had to be cancelled in the country of origin. Thus the stamps were not cancelled in the colony but were instead cancelled on arrival in France. The only exception that is recorded is a double-rate letter posted to Turin, Sardinia requiring the 10c for the correct franking (see lot 11), but even this cover was routed the same as French covers and the stamps were cancelled in France. This amazing cover is of the utmost rarity in all of its aspects, from the French markings canceling the stamps, which are highly out of the ordinary, to the rarity of the stamps used to make this unique franking. Its quality is exceptional with an incredibly rare strip of five of the 10c Bister and attractive well struck markings. This franking is the only recorded single-rate cover making use of the 10c Ceres. See Figure \ref{tencents}.

The 10c value issued to the four colonies presents a strange enigma because 
there apparently was little intended use for this value except for the 
35c rate by private ship of which no cover is known from Guadeloupe


\subsection{Mail from the Island of Marie Galante}
the small village of Grand Bourg is on the small island of Marie Galante located to the southeast of the two major islands of Guadeloupe, this sparsely populated island saw very little commerce in this period; this is the only recorded use of French stamps from Grand Bourg. (See Figure \ref{grandbourg}).

\subsection{Insufficiently paid}
Insufficiently paid covers were paid by the recipient. They were marked in manuscript "timbres insuffisant".

Roumet certificate.  Est. $4,000-5,000 
SOLD for $5,250.00  }


\subsection{Double rate}
Letters charged at the double rate of 3Fr are uncommon. This spectacular cover is an extreme rarity first of all because of this high value franking being made up of entirely of 25c values. This is the largest number of that value on any cover recorded from Guadeloupe. In addition the franking is one 25c value short of making the proper double rate of 3Fr. This was most certainly an oversight by the sender who failed to count the number of stamps correctly. This is confirmed by the fact that nowhere along the travels of this cover was the deficiency recognized and it was handled as a fully paid letter; See figure \ref{doublerate}.

\subsection{Mail from Moule}
Moule is located on the northeast coast of the island of Grande Terre, while it is the third largest town in all of Guadeloupe, following Basse-Terre and Pointe-a-Pitre, very few covers with French stamps are known used out of this town; this exceptionally rare double franking is the only such cover recorded from Moule. See Figure\ref{moule}.

\subsection{Triple rate}

The substantial rate of 1Fr50c per
7.5 grams made it rather expensive to
send even a double rate cover. This remarkable triple-rate cover is one of only
two or three recorded. The amount of
postage required results in an incredibly
rare franking and a strip of four of the
1Fr is very rare even on a French cover,
not to mention that it is immensely more
so on a cover from Guadeloupe. Yet
even beyond its rarity is the exceptional
beauty of this impressive cover making
this a wonderful showpiece of Guadeloupe philately. See Figure~\ref{triple}.

\subsection{Mail to Destinations other than France}

A rare cover to Turin is shown in Figure\ref{turin}. The French stamps issued to Guadeloupe and the other colonies were really for the purpose of prepaying correspondence to France. There apparently was no reason why letters could not be prepaid to other countries in Europe. In fact, the issuance of the 10c implied that eventuality because the 25c and 1Fr values were all that were required to pay the rate and its multiples to France. This cover illustrates the most efficient franking of the double 1Fr70c rate to the Italian States. It could not have been correctly made if there were no 10c values. 

\ph[98%]{../guadeloupe/11.jpg}{11 France Yvert #1, #6, 1849 1Fr Carmine horizontal strip of three along with four singles of the 1850 10c Bister, all tied to 1853 cover to Turin, Sardinia by large point roller cancel of Paris, clear black "Pointe-a-Pitre/Guadeloupe/8 Mai 1853" double-circle c.d.s. at right, posted via British packet with red Calais entry transit and boxed "PD" handstamp, all markings being unusually clear, backstamped Turino, stamps with mostly clear to large margins, several stamps, including one stamp in the strip, with edge flaws from postal wear being affixed close to the edge, closed tears to the backflap, still impressive and of very fine appearance.  signed

While foreign postings were apparently permitted and possible, the great rarity offered here is the only known example using French stamps to any other country than France from any of the four colonies that received these stamps; a wonderful and probably unique cover described thus on the accompanying certificate;
