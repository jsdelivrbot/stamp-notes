# The Stamps and Postal History of Bhopal

Bhopal was an important, predominantly Muslim Princely State of India with an area of 6,902 square miles and a population of 786,000. 

The first postage stamp issues were made in 1876 and up to 1903 were drawn singly on the lithographic stones, by draughtsmen who---as Robson Lowe--- remarked were not  well acquanted with English, hence the many mistakes in spelling!

The first stamps were rectangular with an octagonal centre, with embossed arabic writing.
The frame was bilingual with the rulers named inscribed in English.

The Deputy Postmaster is reported to have admitted "that outside sales exceed those to His Highness's subjects, to dela with which a special clerk was employed" and that perforated and imperforate copies were on sale "as gentlemen ask for both."  The outstanding rarity is the 1/4a. black of 1876. with a single frame of which only four copies are known.

Used copies of the three lowest values of the first issue are common. Covers except when bearing the 1/4a. value are scarce.

In 1948 there were 40 post offices in the state.

The stamps went out of use in 1903 but in 1908 official stamps printed by Perkins Bacon & Co. made their appearance and were still current in 1948, though since 1930 they were printed at Nasik or locally.
