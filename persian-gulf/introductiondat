1015  17th CENTURY ACCOUNT FOR RANSOM OF SPECIAL OVERLAND MESSENGERS SENT TO INDIA VIA THE PERSIAN GULF ROUTE; Remarkable 1664/5 foolscap document addressed "To present to ye Principall Offic[er]s of ye Navy" outlining amounts due for 4 special Government messengers sent to India with a "Packett of Letters sent from Secry. Bennett for India ye 5th March 1663". The "Bennett" in question was Henry Bennet (1618-85; Lord Arlington from 1663 and Secretary of State 1662-74 - Postmaster General 1667-85). The basic cost for this was $40, but $158 more was needed "For charges disbursed by Consull Lannoy being charged on him by the Fackers [= Fakirs] of Bussora [Basrah in Iraq] for sending & clothing of 4 men which went out of England under ye Comand [= at the request?] of ye Earle of Marlborough and were surprised [= kidnapped!] by ye Arabs....". The Earl of Marlborough (1618-65) was sent to India in 1662 to receive Bombay from the Portuguese as part of King Charles II's dowry from the King of Portugal; these ill-fated messengers were then sent out in 1663/4 when the Portuguese refused to hand over the city. One wonders if the $158 included the men's ransom paid to the Arabs? Amazing insight into the problems of 
communication by this route; no wonder the slower Cape of Good Hope route remained in fashion. Photo  	£750

1016  	 	RARE "p. ZENOBIA TO PERSIAN GULPH" ROUTED PACKET LETTER FROM BOMBAY TO LONDON; 22 July 1839 EL (some staining affects address, plus some ink-etching affects flap) from "Bombay" sent by the short-lived and little-used (monsoon-period) Persian Gulf route; via Muscat, Bushire, Karo, Basra, Baghdad & Beirut to Alexandria. The letter was addressed to Madeira, but is endorsed to their London office; there is the unusual "p. Zenobia to Persian Gulph" endorsement on the front, along with red oval-framed Bombay "INDIA" and charges ending with "2/8". The flap has a v. fine London Foreign Branch 21 Sept. 1839 arrival c.d.s. It seems that the letter - an order for a hogshead of Madeira - was duplicated by a letter sent by the normal route. Rare. Photo  	£240
