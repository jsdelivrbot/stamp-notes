### Vryburg

{{wi:Vryburg}} was a small town in Griqualand West (now South Africa), half-way between Mafeking and Kimberley.
It was occupied by Boer forces from Novemeber 1899 to May 1900. A type-set overprint <strong>Z.A.R</strong> and surcharge 
was placed on captured stocks of Cape of Good Hope Stamps.

### Numbers printed
A very small run was made as the stocks were low.

### Covers
No known covers exist

###Forgeries
Both the overprint and VRYBURG cancellation has been counterfeited. Genuine stamps are all of pale shades.
Dark shades are suspect. Genuine stamps with forged cancellations are not known.

Robson Lowe states that the Boers used the original Cape obliterators after chipping the letters B.B. (British Bechuanaland), but
traces of the bottoms of these are always visible.

O.F.S. stamps 1/2 d. to 6d. cancelled within appropriate dates are also known. It is possible their use
was legitimate.

##British Occupation Issues
In May 1900, British Forces entered the town.

###Numbers Printed

The 1/2 d., and 1d., 60 copies are stated to have been issued. Used copies of the 2d., and 2 1/2 d. are not known.


Robson Lowe states that on the re-occupation of Vryburg a small number of stamps of the Cape were found 1/2 d and 1d. (Hope Standing).
These were used to frank correspondence and are found cancelled with a single circle obliterator, reading,
<strong>VRYBURG C.G.H.</strong> and initials C.St.Q. (C.St.Quintin was the military officer in charge of the 
post office) in place of dating slugs.

With dating slugs this obliterator saw subsequent use for the next ten years.

###Forgeries
2 1/2 with overprint horizontal is a fake. Standing Hope stamps with V.R. SPECIAL POST are believed to be bogus.

##Notes
When the Boer Republic of Republic of Stellaland was established in 1882, 
Vryburg became its capital. The first and only president was G.J. van Niekerk. 
In 1885, the British seized the town and incorporated the area into British Bechuanaland, 
which in turn became part of the Cape Colony in 1895. During the Second Boer War, 
the British built a concentration camp here to house Boer women and children. In 1910, 
the Cape Colony became the Cape Province, one of the four provinces of the Union of South Africa and later the Republic of South Africa. 
When nine provinces were established in 1994, it became part of the North West Province.
