# The Stamps and Postal History of Charkhari

The Princely State of Charkhari was located in Central India. It had an area of  703 square miles and a population of 124,000 at the time India gained its independence. The State Post Office existed in 1893 and stamps were issued in 1894, the postal charges being half those of the Indian Postal Department.



## 1894 Issue

The first Type is shown in \ref{scott1}. The value in this Type is shown in the plural "ANNAS", which distingushes the stamps from the second issue where it is shown in the singular.

The stamps were of a crude design and were all issued in shades of green. The paper was thin white or blue wove paper.

## 1897 Second Issue

The second issue is similar to the first only this time the "S" was removed from the word "ANNAS" perhaps through damage to the original stones.


## 1909

The State became a little more ambitious in 1909, producing a long set up to 1 Rupee. This second type is also bilingual. The set was from 1pice to 1 rupee for which there were several stones: the values were inserted on the stons by hand. This is an interesting issue for the specialist, as it can be found in large blocks and has produced a number of varieties. The stamps shown next (courtesy Tony Macag) illustrates the Charkapi error.

## 1931 Set

Later in 1931 a series depicting various scenes of the state was produced. These stamps had actual postal use but large numbers were postmarked to order and sold at a few annas for the entire set.

The set was sold cancelled to order, and can still be found at very low prices

This though needs some thought as to who was selling all these cancel to order stamps. Obviously ...
