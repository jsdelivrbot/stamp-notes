Determining to make up for lost time regarding regular issues, Tobago
issued in November of the following year its first provisional by bisecting the
6d., orange, and surcharging it "1d" in manuscript. The copy I show of this
is postmarked "Dec. 31, 1880."

The Colony seemed to be perpetually running short of halfpenny stamps,
and the One Penny of December, 1880, issue was allowed to be bisected and used
as a halfpenny value without surcharge. The specimen shown of this bears the
A 14 cancellation.
