A historically important letter and the earliest recorded following the British capture of Tobago. Photo Estimate £ 1,200-1,500 Note: Major-General Cornelius Cuyler and Squadron Leader Vice-Admiral John Laforey sailed for Tobago (under French control since 2 July 1781) and landed their troops at Great Courland Bay on 14 April. Major Gordon lead the asault on Fort castries. Losses were light (18 killed on both sides).
