\begin{letter}
With reference to your letter of yesterday, it appears to us that the best way of carrying out the Requisition for Tobago Postage Stamps will be to amke a new Key-plate with the word 'Postage' inserted therein, as indicated upon the stamp marginally attached. Our charge for this Key-plate would be \pound24. Overprint plates exist for all the duties that are required.

The colours which we should propose to print the stamps in are given upon the fly-leaf, and we shall be gald to hear that these colours are approved by you, and that our proposition in regard to the Key-palre also meets with your acquiescence.
\end{letter}

The Crown Agents approved their suggestion, and also 'the colours submitted by you for the several duties'.

On October 4th the Day Book shows the following entry:

Tobago Postage Stamp

Preliminary Expenses thereon \pound24. 0. 0.
