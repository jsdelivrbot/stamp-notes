\chapter{1886-89 Surcharges}

The many provisional surcharges issued between 1883 and 1896 were, according to Poole (Ref. 3), surcharged by the Government Printing Office in Scarborough. Their method in each case was to construct an overprint forme of 12 units locked in a chase of two rows of six and to apply it five times on each pane of 60. Accordingly, the characteristics of each overprint forme are repeated five times per pane.

There also an interesting flaw which is a break in the last "o" of
"TOBAGO." This is a variety which must have occurred in all values after the first
issue. It appears on the third stamp of the fifth row, being No. 27 on sheet.

In several cases the same overprint forme was apparently retained for a subsequent surcharging, but the chase evidently became loose from time to time so that repairs to the forme were relatively frequent, leading to the appearance of different surcharge settings on different panes of the same issued stamp. These took the form of both horizontal spacing differences and vertical misalignment of one or more digits (notably the ‘P’ in ‘PENCE’). The horizontal spacing between the denomination and the ‘P’ (of ‘PENNY’ or ‘PENCE’) has to date been the feature that has fascinated students of the issue. For the purposes of this study, each horizontal spacing has been measured; the measurements quoted to the nearest 0.25mm are for the space between the centre points of the upright ‘1’ of ‘½’ or ‘1’ and the upright of ‘P’ in ‘PENNY’ or ‘PENCE’.



In addition, there are more important errors such as double and inverted surcharges, although some of the doubles are rather close and do not necessarily imply a second pass through the press. These have been extensively studied and are listed in the catalogues, so I do not propose to address them here unless relevant to the settings. However, minor defects are also often found in certain letters or digits which are evidently caused by the chase becoming loose, and I will mention those that are repeated as they may give clues to the different surcharge settings. In addition, the horizontal setting of the surcharges was often not precisely constant, so the positioning on each stamp can
differ slightly within a horizontal strip. However, in a primitive local surcharge of this character, minor varieties of surcharge can be found in virtually every stamp.

Although not a feature of the surcharge settings, it is important not to underestimate the presence of three minor constant flaws on the basic stamps, as these enable the specialist to establish the position in the overprint forme of small multiples or single stamps. The three flaws relevant to the provisional surcharges are the white stop after the ‘G’ of ‘TOBAGO’ (Row 2, Stamp 4), the broken ‘O’ in ‘TOBAGO’ (Row 5, Stamp 3) and the ‘G’ of ‘TOBAGO’ joined to frame (Row 8, Stamp 3). Note that the more pronounced ‘slash flaw’ that is listed by Gibbons (Ref. 4) does not appear on any of the surcharges, whose issue preceded the appearance of that flaw. There are also a number of flaws on the duty plates of the 4d, 6d and 1s that adds to one’s ability to position the surcharges in their settings.

Unfortunately, no local records exist of the number of stamps so surcharged and it is now too late to expect any to emerge, but estimates have been made, notably by Simon Goldblatt (Ref. 5), based on the consignment numbers of the basic stamps and their probable usage. Whatever the number of stamps surcharged, however, several of the surcharges are now not easy to obtain and large blocks have become worth a substantial premium.

I have read a number of explanations of the sequence of various surcharge settings and theories of the wear and tear that produced the spacing varieties and/or loose type. Such speculation is not very productive and this article instead concentrates on what is known to exist and what varieties of setting can titillate the collector’s interest.

\section{April 1883 2 1/2 PENCE on 6d stone}

After Tobago joined the UPU on 1 February 1881, a 2½d letter rate per ½ oz for destinations up to 300 miles was introduced (with some delay) on 15 December 1881. While this rate could be made up of a combination of 1880 ½d and 1d values, it soon became evident that a 2½d denomination value was urgently required, but it was not until April 1883 that a supply was ordered from De La Rue. That same month, part of the residual stock of the 6d watermarked CC was surcharged ‘2½ Pence’ by the Government Printing Office.

Proving the setting of this stamp is a challenge because no block large than six appears to have survived. Dr Urwick owned this block, which was described in the 6–7 October 1964 catalogue for the sale of his collection as a corner control block. We do not even know which corner of the pane it comes from, as neither the Urwick catalogue nor the Harmers catalogue of 15-17 October 1956, where Urwick evidently acquired it, provides an illustration. I do not know of its current location and hope some member owns it and might send me a scan. No other blocks larger than four of this stamp appear to have survived (and according to my records only seven of them, including the one in the Royal Philatelic Collection) (Ref. 6).
\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../tobago/long-tail-two.jpg}
\caption{1883 ‘2½ PENCE’ on 6d Block with Long-tailed ‘2’ variety.}
\end{marginfigure}

The main feature of this 2½d provisional is the listed flaw SG13b, the long tail to the ‘2’. This is very distinctive (Figure 1) and can be found in several inking states that affect the length of the ‘tail’. Beach recorded it as appearing on No. 12 of the overprint forme (i.e. the last stamp in Rows 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10). He did not, however, explain what evidence he had for this assertion, and unfortunately the catalogue of his collection that was sold by Gibbons in 1972 is no help. Beach owned three blocks of four so he may have been able to reconstruct the setting, but it seems more likely that he had seen Charlton Henry’s plate block of four that showed the variety. Urwick’s plate block of six was presumably from one of the left-hand corners as the Robson Lowe catalogue of his collection in 1964 does not mention the long tail.

This stamp is relatively easily found with minor typographical varieties; I can show three or four lengths of the long tailed ‘2’ flaw and Nigel Chandler FRPSL wrote about a bar across the ‘1’ in BWISC Bulletin 183 of December 1999. I suggest all these are due to inking differences; certainly none of them appear with any consistency. What is also relevant to what follows is that the spacing between ‘2½d’ and ‘PENNY’ appears to be a constant 3mm.

This provisional was followed at rapid intervals by three more surcharged stamps, but this time for the ½d value, so a different chase was required.

\section{January 1886 1/2 PENNY on 6d stone}

A shortage of ½d stamps was the trigger for a sizeable surcharging on the residual stock of the rarely used 6d stamps with CA watermark that had been issued in 1884. No records have survived regarding the number of stamps surcharged. Simon Goldblatt, writing in the BWISC Bulletin 87 of December 1975, surmised that only 20 sheets of the basic 6d stamp would have been used up. So of the 18,000 that the De La Rue records indicate were printed, 280 sheets (i.e. 16,800) stamps would have been surcharged.

Alexander Sefi (Ref. 7) illustrated three surcharge settings on this stamp and Beach mentioned the same three (although he did not own the scarcest setting). However, there seems to be a fourth, although whether they can be called different settings is a moot point since the primitive overprint process produced a number of repeated differences caused by defective letters or digits.

\subsection{Setting A}

Nine of the 12 positions show a 3.25mm space (between the upright ‘1’ in ‘½’ and the upright of ‘P’).

No. 10 shows a much wider (4.25mm) space. The ‘P’ is slightly raised.

No. 1 shows a slightly narrower 3mm space.

No. 7 shows a still narrower 2.75mm space. The fraction bar is straight.

Nos. 1 and 7 have the whole surcharge set further to the left than on the other ten positions, so the space between the ‘PENNY’ on the left-hand stamps and the ‘½’ on the second stamps is about 2mm wider than in the other positions (this spacing does not appear on Settings B to D).

This setting is the most common and blocks of 36 survive but to my knowledge only a single full pane.

\section{Setting B (Figure 3)}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../tobago/setting-b.jpg}
\caption{1886 ‘½ PENNY’ on 6d stone, Setting B with two wide spaces.}
\end{figure*}

Eight of the 12 positions show a regular 3.25mm space.

Nos. 3 and 10 each show a wider (4.25mm) space.

No. 1 shows a slightly narrower 3mm space.

No. 7 shows a still narrower 2.75mm space. The fraction bar slopes upwards at right.

This setting is scarce. The largest known block is 36.

\subsection{Setting C (Figure 4)}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../tobago/setting-c.jpg}
\caption{
1886 ‘½ PENNY’ on 6d stone, Setting C with no wide spaces.}
\end{figure*}


Ten of the 12 positions, including Nos. 3 and 10, show a regular 3.25mm space.

No. 1 shows a slightly narrower 3mm space.

No. 7 shows a still narrower 2.75mm space and the fraction bar slopes upwards at right.

This setting is rare. The block illustrated is thought to be the largest recorded.

\subsection{Setting D}

(Sefi’s setting illustrated in a block of 18 (6 x 3) in the January 1930 PJGB)
Ten of the 12 positions, including Nos. 3 and 10, show a regular 3.25mm space.

No. 1 shows a slightly narrower 3mm space.

No. 7 shows a still narrower 2.75mm space but the fraction bar is straight.

This setting is equally rare. Sefi’s illustration of a block of 18 is the largest recorded. A block of 15 (5 x 3) from the right five columns is also recorded but in the absence of the left-hand column it is not possible to tell whether this is from Setting C or D.
Authors have speculated on the sequence of Settings A, B and C/D but nothing has been proven (Ref. 8). However, the fact that the ‘½ PENNY’ on 2½d dull blue considered in the following paragraph has the same characteristics as Setting A indicates that Setting A may have been the last setting of the ‘½ PENNY’ on 6d stone to be printed. Sheets of this would likely have been on the top of the pile delivered to the Scarborough Post Office and thus the ones most likely to be bought up by speculators. Whatever, setting A is by some way the most common of the four.

\end{figure*}

In addition, this stamp was especially prone to careless surcharging, such as the inaccurate centring of the overprint forme (Figure 7). On the strip illustrated, confirmed as coming from Column 4 by the wide space on the upper stamp, the central setting is far to the left. On one sheet the setting was misplaced vertically, leading to a double surcharge on one row and a missing surcharge on another. Illustrated in Figure 8 is a strip from Column 4 showing the double surcharges with two different spacings, No. 4 with normal spacing and No. 10 with wide spacing. Until recently, it was readily assumed that this strip came from a sheet on which a whole row had the overprint missing, but the recent appearance of a stamp from the lower margin with an additional overprint in the selvedge casts doubt on that assumption.

Although not as common as the surcharge on the 6d stone, at least two complete sheets have been seen, but smaller mint blocks are relatively uncommon. Used blocks, on the other hand, showing the A14 neatly cancelled sideways on each stamp, are relatively common and it appears a full pane was cancelled to order.

\section{April 1886 1/2 PENNY on 2 1/2 d dull blue}

Although legitimate postal usage of the January 1886 surcharges on the 6d would have been minimal (hardly any covers survive, and none of them apparently commercial usages), there was evidently considerable demand from dealers and speculators for the unused stamps as only three months later a second surcharge had to be carried out on the 2½d. 

To date only one surcharge setting has been recorded on this stamp (Figure 5), which is the same as Setting A of the ½ Penny on 6d stone, i.e. a wide space on No. 10 and narrow spaces on No. 1 and No. 7. In addition, the surcharges on No. 1 and No. 7 are set further to the left, as in Setting A. There are, however, clear signs of the chase becoming loose. The most obvious feature is the variable height of the P in Pence on the block illustrated, with it raised on Nos. 7, 9 and 10 and lowered on No. 3. The raised ‘P’, in particular, is sometimes highly pronounced (Figure 6), while the fraction bar wobbles. Indeed, the whole impression is less defined than the earlier surcharges, caused presumably by the overprint forme becoming frailer over time.

\section{August 1887 ‘½ PENNY’ on 6d orange-brown}

One year later, stocks of the ½d definitive ran out again and this time the current 6d value was used for the surcharge, This stamp is distinctly scarcer than the two 1886 surcharges, and no full settings of 12 have survived (indeed the best estimate of the numbers printed, by Simon Goldblatt, indicates that a mere 50–60 sheets were surcharged).

The only block of record, once in the Beach collection and more recently owned by Ben Ramkissoon FRPSL, is a block of eight (4 x 2) from the left-hand margin (Figure~\ref{figure9}). This block confirms that the same basic overprint forme as the two previous issues was used, as it also shows a wide space on No. 10. However, while it is apparently the same as Setting A, it is not possible to be certain unless someone can show us the two right hand columns of the sheet.
