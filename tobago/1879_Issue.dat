\chapter{1879 Issue}

Tobago was the last but one of the West Indies to issue stamps of its own
and commenced with making a Fiscal issue available for postage in 1879. Two
plates were used by Messrs. De La Rue & Co. for printing the stamps, a head plate
and a duty plate. The duty plate for some values was that used for the stamps
of Dominica, hence one finds the same characteristics in varieties of lettering
as in Dominican stamps, notably the malformed " CE " in the FOURPENCE issue
of 1885 and onwards.

Of the 1879 issue the Dominica duty plate was used for
the id., 6d., and i/- values : the 3d., 5/-, and £i values having a special duty
plate. Owing to two plates being used, necessitating two printings, the colour
of the value often differs materially in shade from the rest of the design and the
position in the value space varies. The shades of each value in the first issue
differ, there being a dull shade and a bright shade, showing a first and second
printing.
