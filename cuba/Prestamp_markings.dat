# British Postal Agency in Havana

These covers bare some markings, but it is important to also study the manuscript charges, which were written either in black or red ink. The black ink meant paid and the red to pay. The example shown in \ref{havana} was posted in British Honduras. The charge was 3/- (shown quite clearly). When it arrived in Havana, it was handstamped with the straight "HAVANA" marking and then travelled for almost two and a half months to reach its destination in London, where it received the London, receiving datestamp.

The three shillings charge, was a considerable amount of money those days and reflecting the difficulties and expense of sea travel.
