# Introduction to the Straight Line Town Markings

The first internal mail service in the island was established in 1756. The earliest recorded Cuban town marking (an example of "HAVANA" in negative) dates from 1760 and is now in the Cuban Postal Museum. Correspondence from Cuba during the 18th century is rareand most of it has maritime marking rather than Town markings.
