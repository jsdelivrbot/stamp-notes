# The Stamps and Postal History of Cuba

Cuba is an island country in the Caribbean Sea. The nation of Cuba consists of the main island of Cuba, the Isla de la Juventud, and several archipelagos. Havana is the largest city in Cuba and the country's capital.

Cuban philately can be divided into four periods: the Colonial Era, the U.S. Administration, the Republic, and the Revolution.

## The Colonial Era 

The Colonial Era comprises two very distinct periods: the pre-philatelic period and the
colonial stamps period.

### Pre-Philately 

This period goes from the inception of the mail service in Cuba until 1855 when stamps started to be used for the pre-payment of all correspondence. Before the use of stamps to frank correspondence, postal markings were used to designate the town or city of origin, the points of transit and receipt, and the postal rates. The study of these postal markings trace the route that was traveled by each letter and is a fascinating aspect of Cuban philately.

### The Stamps of the Colonial Era 

This period goes from the use of the first stamp issued by Spain for use in Cuba
in 1855 until the stamps of the last Spanish issue for Cuba, the 1898 stamps of Alfonso XIII that were used in that
year until the American intervention in the Spanish-American War. This is the classical period in the stamps of
Cuba. It is interesting to note that the first stamps issued by Spain for use in Cuba were also placed in use in Puerto
Rico and the Philippine Islands, and thereafter until 1876 inclusive, stamps were issued for the common use of Cuba
and Puerto Rico. It was only starting in 1877 that Spain issued stamps for their exclusive use in Cuba. The classic
period of Cuban philately includes some of the great rarities of world philately, such as the first surcharged stamp of
the world, issued officially for the franking of correspondence within the city of La Habana in the year 1855. [A
surcharged stamp is an already issued stamp on top of which a “surcharge” is applied changing its use and
denomination (postal value)—in the case of the first surcharged stamp of Cuba, it was a 2 reales stamp that was
revalued to ¼ of a real for the specific use of mailing letters within the city of La Habana.]


## The U.S. Administration 

This period extends from the middle of 1898 after the U.S. occupies the island of
Cuba after its victory in the Spanish-American War until Cuba is declared an independent Republic on 20 May 1902. Although this was a short period of time, it is immensely rich and interesting from the philatelic point of view due to the variety of stamps used to frank correspondence during that transitional period and their various uses, many of a provisional nature. During that period some U. S. stamps were used as such to frank military correspondence, Spanish Cuba stamps continued to be used to frank correspondence for several months, some of these stamps were even surcharged in U.S. currency for local use in the area of Puerto Príncipe, U.S. stamps were surcharged for use in Cuba, and finally, the U.S. issued stamps for the sole use of Cuba. The study of the postal rates
applied during this period presents various aspects, spanning the continued use of Spanish Cuba postal rates and stamps to provisional and transitional rates, including special rates for the U.S. troops in Cuba that initially even saw
the use of U.S. stamps in military mail, and ending with the final postal rates that were in effect upon the inauguration of the Republic and even some time thereafter.


## The Republic 

This period extends from 20 May 1902, date in which Cuba achieves independence until the
triumph of the Fidel Castro revolution on 1 January 1359. During the Republican era a great number of
commemorative stamps are issued honoring distinguished individuals and significant events in Cuban history.
During this period there is great interest in Cuban philately as evidenced by the numerous postal issues and the
philatelic societies and clubs that are created and the considerable number of philatelic journals that are published,
some of which had runs of many years with substantial philatelic content.


## The Revolution 

This period extends from 1 January 1959 to date. It is characterized by the great numbers of stamps issued as vehicles of indoctrination and source of revenue for the state. During the years that the Castro government has been in power up to April 2005, it has issued 4058 different stamps according to the Edifil Specialized Catalog of Cuba, Volume II.. As a point of comparison, there were a total of 813 stamps issued during the Spanish and U.S. Administrations and the Republic combined according to Volume I of the same catalog. That
is, the production of stamps during the Castro revolutionary government has been about 5 times greater than that of all of the previous philatelic eras. As we have noted, a great number of the stamps issued have a political theme for indoctrination purposes. The rest are of a topical nature, showing flowers, birds, art object, sports and similar topics
to try to attract the attention of topical philatelists.


 
## First stamps and postal stationery


The first stamps of Cuba were joint issues with Puerto Rico, issued in April, 1855.[1] These stamps are referred to as the "Antilles". At first, Isabella II had her portrait on all regular issues until her abdication in 1868. Cuba had separate stamps from 1873.[2] Postage stamps continued to be labeled only "ULTRAMAR" (overseas) until the word CUBA appeared for the first time in 1877. The portrait of Alfonso XII adorned the stamps from 1876 until 1880, some three years after his posthumously born successor, Alfonso XIII, assumed the throne under Regency status, and had his portrait instead. This depicted a baby whose hairline was considerably receded and thus earned the irreverent nickname of el pelón (baldie). Finally, in 1898, a youth with tousled hair appears.

Postal cards for Cuba were printed in Spain and sent to their colonies in 1878.[3] With the war of independence for Cuba, the United States intervened from 1898 to 1902. At that time, stamped envelopes and newspaper wrappers became available to the residents of Cuba
