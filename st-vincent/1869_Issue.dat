\chapter{Issue 6. September 1869}

As stated earlier two stamps were ordered hastily, due to the disatisfaction with the One Shilling indigo. The idea was that these colours would provide a sharp contrast, since the Colonial Secretary felt that the indigo stamp would be confused with the Four Pence blue of Issue 3. These two stamps vary but little in colour, although there are shades of the brown. Both are rare, and doubly rare well-centered.

Instead of appeasing the Colonial Secretary, however, these stamps only brought more criticism.

With the exception of a consignment of One Penny stamps, sent out 14th February 1870, the Four Pence yellow and One Shilling brown were the last St. Vincent stamps printed on unwatermarked paper.

Blocks are rare with only three blocks of four recorded for the one shilling stamp. There was a block of nine in the General Gill collection. At least nine covers are known.
