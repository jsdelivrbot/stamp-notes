\chapter{St Vincent}

The stamps and postal history of St. Vincent, have attracted philatelists from both sides of the Atlantic since the early days of philately. The early issues are not hard to find in poor to medium condition, but good copies demand premiums and sell over catalogue value. Luckily some major collections have been dispersed over the last few years and we were lucky to have a glimpse of the available stamps. 

The classic stamps were documented as early as 1895 with a publication by Francis H. Napier and E. D. Bacon, published by Stanley Gibbons. Numerous auction catalogues provide further information as well as the publications of the West Indian Study Society.
