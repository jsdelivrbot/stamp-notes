As from 1st April 1863, the Packet Letter rate to the United Kingdom was raised from 6d. to one shilling. A need for a 4d. stamp was also apparent as it was the long standing rate between ports in British America. This issue was no doubt required to satisfy these demands. 



With this issue begins that almost constant series of colour changes which long baffled philatelists, and were never explained until \textit{The Perkins Bacon Records} were published. The answers are found in the correspondence.
