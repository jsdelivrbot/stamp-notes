\chapter{Issue 4. July 1868}

The 6d. deep green stamp has always been a very elusive stamp. Study of numerous covers by A.D. Pierce et al, made them to conclude that this postage stamp with perforation B---11-13 was a late-comer, presumably by the very last printing of Six Pence stamps, on unwatermarked paper, i.e. the consignment which was sent on 15 June, 1868.
