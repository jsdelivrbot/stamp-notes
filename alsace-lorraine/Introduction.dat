\chapter{Alsace-Lorraine} 
Alsace (French: Alsace  is the fifth-smallest of the 27 regions of France in land area (8,280 km2), and the smallest in metropolitan France. 

Alsace is located on France's eastern border and on the west bank of the upper Rhine adjacent to [Germany](../germany/introduction) and [Switzerland](../switzerland/introduction). The political, economic and cultural capital as well as largest city of Alsace is Strasbourg. Because that city is the seat of dozens of international organizations and bodies, Alsace is politically one of the most important regions in the European Union.
