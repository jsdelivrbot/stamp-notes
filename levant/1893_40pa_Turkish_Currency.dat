Lot: 252		Sale: 70 British Levant: Turkish Currency: 1893 40pa. on 1/2d. vermilion handstamped Constantinople provisional in a fine unmounted mint horizontal strip of five, believed to be not only the largest extant mint multiple (one block of four being present in the Royal Collection) but also the only mint multiple in private hands. The British Postmaster in his haste to create a 40 paras substitute, neglected to send examples of the provisional overprint to the U.P.U. When the error was brought to his attention by the G.P.O. in London, a further printing of some 800 examples was made. These all show the late state of the handstamp with broken “S” in “PARAS”. Strips of five were then circulated to each U.P.U. member in December 1894. A much undercatalogued stamp in mint condition, this provisional having been in use for five days only at the Constantinople and Stamboul offices. S.G. 7. B.P.A. certificate (2005). Photo. Price Realised £9000.}
