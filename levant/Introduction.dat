## British Levant

The use of British stamps and later of the stamps of Great Britain especially either
surcharged or overprinted in post offices in the Levant was occasioned by the  [Crimean
War](../crimea/introduction) during which a branch of the Army Post Office was established 
in Constantinople. This was closed in July 1857 when the Crimea was evacuate by 
the Allied Forces.

When this occurred a petition was made by the large British Colony to the British Government
for the establishment of a civil post office. This was duly granted and authority for the use
of British stamps was given on September 22, 1857, the large C obliteration
being ready for despatch on October 15, 1857 (Sampson). From the close of that year current
British 1d., 2d., 4d., 6d., and 1s. were kept in stock at the post office and in 1867 other
values up to 5s. were added.

A post office at {{wi:Smyrna}} was opened in 1872, at Beyrout in 173, at {{wi:Stamboul}}\footnoe{Stamboul was used in Western languages as an equivalent of Ä°stanbul, until the time it was replaced by the official new usage of the Turkish form in the 1930s. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Western European and American sources often used Constantinople to refer to the metropolis as a whole, but Stamboul to refer to the central parts located on the historic peninsula, i.e. Byzantine-era Constantinople inside the walls.}
 in 1884 and
at Salonica in 1900. The office in Stamboul was closed during the Armenin troubles in
the early 1890's but reopened on February 10, 1908.

note: this provisional was unauthorised and some feel was philatelic;
most examples (including those used on piece) were produced after it was
withdrawn using the original handstamp and, in the case of used copies, a
postmark using the same canceller as used during the period of currency.
There are numerous forgeries.
