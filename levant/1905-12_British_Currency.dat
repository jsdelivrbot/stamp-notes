\chapter{1905-12 English Currency}    

These series in British currency were issued to simplify the calculation of charges by the
Steamship and Railway Companies. This avoided conversions and agreements due to
the ever changing conversion rates of the Turkish currency.

The stamps were issues on the 15th of August. They were overprinted in panes of 12x10
on the then current stamps of Great Britain and they can be found on normal as well
as chalky paper.
