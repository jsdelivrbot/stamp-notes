\chapter{1885-88 Turkish Currency}  

From the establishment of the British Post Office in November 1854, current British stamps
had been on sale in Constantinople\cite{Robson Lowe, Volume I, _Great Britain and
the Empire in Europe_, page 435.} At the time the exchange rate was 1 {{wi:piastre}} = 2 1/2 d. sterling. The
(40 {{wi:para}})depreciation of Turkish currency in 1884 reduced the piastre to an equivalent of 2d. and in 
order to prevent speculation the stamps were surcharged in Turkish currency. \cite{See also Cyprus
issues in this period, where surcharging in paras was also necessary.}

The first surcharges were printed by De La Rue and Co. Watermark Imperial Crown. Perf. 14.
The surcharge was in black 17mm long (40 and 80 paras) and 20 mm long (12 piastres).

\section{Specimen}

All three stamps were further ovrprinted `Specimen' in black small Roman {{wi:antique_capitals}},
close spaced 15 x 1 3/4 mm. The overprint is often not straight. There are several types
of S; the left top of M is generally broken and the right bottom of N is generally prolonged. presumabbly
the overprint was applied by hand.
