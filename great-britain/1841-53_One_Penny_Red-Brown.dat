\chapter{1841-53 One Penny Red-brown} 

In 1841, for a variety of reasons, mostly having to do with fraudulent re-use of postage stamps, the color of the one penny was changed from black to red. The term 'Penny Stars' is often used for this incomparably complex series of stamps which were in continual production from Fed. 10, 1841 until April 1862. The complexity of this series is due, ignoring at least 20 distinct shades color shades, not only to the hundreds of plates used for printing, but to that fact that 2 master dies, both imperforate and perforate issues (2 gauges as well as experimental perforations), 2 watermarks (and 2 varieties of one) and 4 fonts (alphabets) as well as various combinations were used for these stamps.

The first printing of the imperforate penny reds were made from the some of the same plates as the penny blacks.

\subsection{Imprimanturs}

An impression of each new printing plate was required to be made on watermarked
paper and submitted to Somerset House for approval. This was called the
imprimatur sheet. Once approval had been given, this sheet was stored in the
archives. 

During the 19th century a number of stamps were officially removed from
each sheet as gifts to important people. Around the year 1900 three of the corner
examples were removed from each sheet and made into presentation sets. One set was
given to H.R.H. The Duke of York (later King George V) and remains in the Royal
collection. The second set was given to the Earl of Crawford, which later passed into
the collection of Col. A.S. Bates, his collection being sold in 1934.

of the owner and was sold by auction in 1946. The imprimatur sheets often show
shade variations to the issued stamps. The sheets of Line-engraved are all without
gum. The corner examples, showing the plate number, are particularly prized, there
being only two examples from each sheet available in private hands. These command
a significant premium over the normal examples, all are unique in private hands

\subsection{Plate 113}

Plate 113 of the One Penny value condemned, but afterwards accepted.
In a letter written by Mr. Orniond Hill on March 25tli, 1868, ' addressed to Mr.
Fisher, one of the employees of Perkins, Bacon & Co., he said : " I am sorry that I cannot pass Plate No. 113 : but the inaccuracy in it is greater than can be permitted." Mr. J. P. Bacon in his reply on April 2nd,- said that the plate was only " the 24th
part of an inch untrue when measured crossways and I have no hope and certainly never contracted to make plates regularly that shall be nearer mathematical accuracy than that. If the irregularity is divided over the whole plate, ivhich I donht. it will amount to a deviation of a 480th of an inch in each row an inappreciable quantity,
while, if as I believe, a local error, it would not effect the perforation of the one row enough to be noticed." And then he made the interesting statement that "The die
itself is not exactly true and therefore the error, as it effects perforation, is more
apparent than real." Further on he said " there is an actual waste of time between
the completion of the transferring of a plate and the knowledge of its acceptance or
rejection, as it is impossible niw to risk further progress on a plate until it is known
to be accepted." From the last statement it is clear that a custom had grown up of submitting the actual plates to Somerset House as soon as the 240 impressions had
been laid down and previous to the insertion of the letters in the four comers of the impressions, etc. On the 3rd, April, ' Mr. Hill sent two letters to the firm. In the first he said he had intended calling to see Mr. J. P. Bacon that day, but had been prevented and
that lie would do so the following day, if possible. In the second he wrote : " Plate No. 114 examined to-day is not quite correctly laid down : but as the total inaccuracy docs not exceed 1/32 of an inch I will agree to accept it. A greater amount of inaccuracy could not be passed." On the 23rd April, * Mr. Hill wrote to Mr. Bacon : " 

Another careful examination
has been made of Plate No. 113 the one which we declined to accept on account of want of accuracy. The result is that it appears not quite so much out of square
as was believed and that we will accept it, expressing a hope at the same time that
all future plates may be more accurate." (Bacon p.174).
