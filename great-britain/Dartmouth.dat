A Cruise from the Dart in  January 1880.

 

The Dartmouth History Research Group were recently given a copy of a diary passed to Nigel Way of the Royal Castle Hotel by a guest,  who is a descendant of the writer.   No one can now remember the guest’s name, so if he sees this article will he please contact the Group

through the Dartmouth Chronicle so that we can thank him?

 

Between 1871 and 1891  luxurious steam/sailing ships of Donald Currie’s Cape and Natal Line left London  for Cape Town twice a month.  Passengers wishing to avoid a rough passage down the English Channel could take the train to Kingswear and embark there.   These extracts from his diary describe the experiences of one such traveller: 

 

In the winter of 1879 I suffered much from a bronchial infection.    One of the most eminent physicians in the north of England  advised me to take a six months holiday and have a long sea voyage to a warmer climate.  South Africa was chosen as the first stopping place.    Berths were taken in the Kinfauns Castle,  one of the Donald Currie line of steamers plying between London and Capetown.  She was  a new vessel, and this was to be her first voyage.  She was built by John Elder of Glasgow,  3507 tons,  engines of 500 nominal horse power, steel plated. Her commander was Capt. John Howson, the oldest captain on the line and Commodore of the Fleet, with a crew, all English, numbering 106.

 

The   ship was fitted in the most handsome manner, good taste being displayed in every department.   The saloon, forty three feet square, was light and cheerful and capable of seating about 100 first class passengers.  The berths all exceedingly clean & well ventilated - a matter of the greatest importance in tropical climates especially.  The  ladies were provided with a most elegant boudoir on the quarter deck, and the gentlemen had a room also on the deck forward for smoking.  The ship could carry in all 356 passengers.

 

She was to sail from London on the 20th January 1880  and from Dartmouth on the 23rd of the same month.  My brother Walter having decided to accompany me, we left Leeds by the Great Northern train for London.  Parting from my dear wife and two darling children was very painful, but knowing that it was all for my good the dear girl bore up bravely and we could only pray that we might be spared to meet once more with renewed health.

 

In London, Walter, taking all the luggage, joined the ship at the South West India Dock,  while I and two friends, who were to see me off, took the Great Western  train the next morning to Dartmouth to await the arrival of the ship there.

 

We took up our abode for the few days at the Castle Hotel, about which I am afraid nothing very good can be said.  It was neither clean nor comfortable and the charges were such as ought to command better accommodation”    *(It is much better now! - Nigel Way.)  

 

We could see little of Dartmouth or its neighbourhood on our arrival as it was dark, but next morning revealed the little landlocked bay in all its exquisite beauty.  We strolled along the western bank and about 12 o’clock caught sight of a steamer rounding the Castle Point.  I had not supposed it to be ours as she was not expected before evening.  Such however proved to be the case so we lost no time in going on board to see how Walter had fared down Channel.  Contrary to expectation we found him all jolly, not having been sick at all.  They had had beautiful weather all the way. 

As we were not to sail till Friday at noon we spent the intervening time in wandering about the charming little place and rowing up the river to inspect the Britannia training ship for naval cadets.  This is the vessel on board which the two young Princes received their early training.  She is a large vessel and finds accommodation for about 200 boys but having about 700 persons aboard.  We were shown round, and a man explained the system on which the ship was worked.  The average cost to the parents of the boys was about £200 a year.”

 

We all dined on board with the passengers and were charmed by the splendid manner in which everything was both cooked and served.  In fact,  during the whole voyage the manner in which meals were served would have done credit to the best hotels of London or Paris. 

 

On Friday morning we went on board for good.  As soon as we had received the North mails, orders were given to clear the ship of strangers, and we had to part from our two friends.  They rowed down the stream a short way so as to get a last look at us waving handkerchiefs.     We were soon round the point and out of sight.

 

The first part of the voyage, that to Madiera and the part most dreaded [i.e. across the Bay of Biscay] was most enjoyable.  We were favoured with a nice breeze from the north west which enabled us to hoist the two mainsails and by steering close into the wind to get through the water at a good rate.   In about an hour we were off Start Point teaming about 12 knots which we gradually increased to 14.  By 9 o’clock at night we were off Cape Ushant where we could see the lighthouse.  We were now fairly in the dreaded “Bay”.  All seemed to promise fair weather however so we retired to rest hoping that Neptune might allow us to get across without any serious inconveniences.   As this was the first night on which I was fairly to try what a ship’s bunk was like I was a little uneasy as to whether I should be able to get over it without sickness.  To my great satisfaction I was able to sleep well.

 

“In the morning I rose early at 7.30 and went on deck.  The air was slightly cold and the wind was nice and fresh.  A shoal of porpoises gambolled round the ship affording infinite pleasure to those who had seen nothing of the kind before.  At exactly 12 o’clock the sun was taken and the log made out when we found that we had made 336 miles from Dartmouth.   This was done at every following noon and the number of miles posted on a card at the head of the Companion ladder so that every passenger might have an idea how we were getting on.  A chart was also kept with the position of the ship marked every day for the use of the passengers.

 
“On Sunday morning the English service was beautifully read in the saloon by the Captain after the Crew had been paraded before him on the Quarter deck.  The piano was played by one of the gentlemen passengers.  We had covered 319 knots at 12 noon.  Towards evening the wind began to stir a little more so we hoisted our topsails, determined to get as much help out of it as possible.   For the next 24 hours we bowled along at a glorious rate,  while in the evening we were occupied in finishing letters to our friends at home to be posted from Madiera where we expected arrive early the next morning.  On this day the log showed the largest number of miles of any day during the voyage - 346 knots - it being the greatest number made by any ship on this or the Union Line.

 

“Early on Tuesday morning we dropped anchor in Funchal roads, having made the passage in 3 days 16 hours, the quickest on record at this time.”
