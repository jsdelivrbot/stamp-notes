2093  	 	THE RARE 'WEST INDIA ROOM' INSPECTOR's "A" IN CIRCLE ON COVER TO JAMAICA;
5 Nov. 1831 EL from "London" to "Vere, Jamaica" endorsed "P. Packet" and so
charged "2/2" (which became "3/9" in local currency on arrival to include inland
Jamaica postage) with a "L[ombard] S[treet]" backstamp and a mostly very fine rare
"A" in circle on the front; this "A" mark (Jay L1045) is only recorded on a few
Transatlantic letters of 1830-33 but is recorded as having been issued to
"the West India Room" of the P.O. in London on 14 Aug. 1830. It seems that
it is some kind of mis-sort mark indicating that a letter was sorted in
error for West Indies or North America bags, but spotted before despatch.
It is particularly unusual on mail to Jamaica. \pound150.}
