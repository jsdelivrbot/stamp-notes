2106  	 	UNIQUE(') RED "NOT/PAID" IN CIRCLE ON "Too Late" COVER FROM LONDON TO FRANCE; Unusual 4 Mar. 1840 E sent unpaid to Lyons with a very fine red London "Too Late" on the front as well as an erroneous strike (heavily inked out at the time) of a red London "PAID" datestamp overlapping the black "TP/Regents St. NO" on the front. Also having a very fine very rare red encircled "NOT PAID" (Jay L1112; apparently issued to the Foreign Branch in 1840) - the only example of which we are aware - also on the front. It seems likely that this unusual mark - odd to have an unpaid mark struck in red too - had a very short life (perhaps being withdrawn with the arrival of Stamps in May 1840'). Important London Prestamp and British Postage Dues cover.    	\pound500

2111  	 	'DISCRIMINATORY RATE' PERIOD - S.S. 'WASHINGTON' COVER CHARGED AN EXTRA 1/- IN TRANSIT THROUGH G.B. TO FRANCE; 18 Nov. 1847 EL from "New York" to Agents in London for forwarding to "Cognac" endorsed "P. [S.S.] Washington via Southampton" and carried on the 3rd voyage of this American Ocean Line's rival to the Cunard steamers; having the red curved NY "PAID" mark but charged the 'Discriminatory' rate of "1/-" by the GB PO (as if it had been unpaid) who promptly added insult to injury by missending it to "SUNDERLAND" (backstamp of 9 Dec.!). The final French charge of "48" therefore included this 1/- Discriminatory charge that soon led to the 'Retaliatory Rates' imposed by both British and US PO's on letters carried by steamers of the other country"! Few voyages were made for which these pre-Retaliatory rates were raised.    \pound200

(v. fine "AMERICA/LIVERPOOL" c.d.s. backstamp) with a v. fine handstruck "1/-"
charge-mark on the front. This 1/- (the Retaliatory Rate) was duly paid by someone
