The most common source of Very Fine Used stamps (CDS) from this period though is from Telegraph receipts or Post Office in house accounting. 

Most of the high value stamps of Victoria (2/6 and above) were used in this way. Very few high values, particularly the &pound;5 Orange (SG 133/137), were stuck on envelopes and postally used.
