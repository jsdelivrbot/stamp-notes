\ph[70%]{../UK/2049.jpg}{
2049  	 	THE RAREST OF THE "PP" FOREIGN BRANCH TO PENNY POST TRANSFER MARKS ON COVER FROM PORTUGAL; 17 Jan. - 13 Feb. 1795 EL (family contents; minor toning at left) from "Massarallos" (near Lisbon) to London (Cavendish Square) charged "3/-" and then "3-1" with a fair "FE/13" London Foreign Branch Bishop Mark on the top flap matching the very fine small Handstruck "P.P." mark (Jay L1024) alongside. This undated "PP" mark - indicating that the letter was handed over from the F.B. staff to the local London post for delivery - was only first discovered in 1984; only a handful of them have been recorded. \pound300.

2050  	 	THE "PP/1795" F.B. TO PENNY POST TRANSFER MARK ON COVER FROM PORTUGAL; Matching 5 July - 5 Aug. 1795 EL from "Massarallos" (from the same correspondence as the previous lot) with a very fine larger "PP/1795" in circle mark (L1025; light file fold and slightly overstruck but very clear) on the top flap beside a very fine matching Foreign Branch "AU/5" arrival Bishop Mark, charged "16" (1s-6d) and then a further "4" (with fine double-boxed "Great Mary-/le-Bone" RH mark on reverse) for forwarding to Kent. It seems likely that the date was added to the "PP" Mark to prevent it from being confused with French Paid "PP" marks known to have been in use since at least the 1760s. Good letter ref. bull-fights, etc.    \pound240

2051  	 	"PP/1797" IN CIRCLE TRANSFER MARK ON LETTER FROM VIENNA UNDER THREAT FROM NAPOLEON's FORCES; Fine 28 Apr. 1797 EL from "Vienna" to London charged "1/-" with a very fine encircled "PP/1797" (L1025b; slightly affected by manuscript notes) beside a very fine 2-ring matching "FOREIGN OFFICE" c.d.s. (L1003; early usage) on the flap; the PP mark again indicated transfer of the letter from the F.B. to the local London Penny Post for delivery (this time at no extra cost). The contents are highly significant, written by the only English civilian apparently allowed to remain in Vienna while Napoleon and his Army advanced almost to its outskirts; the other English inhabitants did not have the Minister's permission to stay and so suffered dreadful privations on the road; "thousands were hurrying away together; several were obliged to pass two nights successively in their carriages, & in many places a loaf of bread was not to be purchased. We, however, on our side were not sleeping on Roses, for the nearness of Buonaparte & his Army, the preparations making for the defence of the town...and the danger of remaining in a besieged town...made us pass many a grievous hour until the 18th [April]..." The "Peace of Leoben" (drafted entirely by Napoleon himself!) was signed on 18th Apr. 1797 and ended Napoleon's advance on Vienna, but it enabled him to turn his attention to more important objectives - the Austrians basically surrendered to him. Important letter from a pivotal moment in Napoleon's rise.    	\pound240}

2052  	 	GIBRALTAR - OFFICER's LETTER TO G.B. WITH "PP/1798" IN CIRCLE TRANSFER MARK; Long 20 Mar. 1798 EL from "Gib[ralta]r" to Woolwich (from one Lieut. Col. to another) having a fine but overstruck "PP/1798" in circle (L1025c) across the join on the reverse with matching FB c.d.s.'s. The contents emphasise the writer's desire for promotion (to be the Gibraltar Governor's Aide de Camp?) and gives news of French preparations for the subjugation of Spain; ""...the French have made a demand on the Spaniards for 8,000,000 of Calles (?), which of course they must immediately comply with...the French are most certainly collecting large Forces in Perpignan to march to Madrid..." Scarce mail from the 'Rock' at this critical stage of the French Wars.    \pound150

2053  	 	RARE ENCIRCLED "T.P/1803" F.B. TO 2d-POST TRANSFER MARK ON "Franco Cuxhaven" COVER FROM GERMANY; 6 Sept. - 3 Oct. 1803 EL (in German) from "Borcken" (Germany) to Ilford (Essex) endorsed "Frco Cuxhaven" (prepaid to Cuxhaven) and charged "1/4" but also having a mostly very fine rare encircled "T.P/1803" transfer mark (Jay L1026; this style only in use for this one year and much rarer than the earlier "PP" types; slight stain) on the flap matching the 2-ring FB c.d.s. The "PP" letters were changed to "TP" when the London Penny Post became the Twopenny Post with the increase of rates in 1802; the "T/PP" style (see following lots) were used in 1802 and 1804-12, but this plainer "T.P" type - the rarest of all these Transfer marks - was only in use in 1803.    	\pound300
