## The Prince Consort Essay 1850

During the first decades of the introduction of postage stamps the British Post Office were experimenting with various production methods. Many individuals and firms produced innovative designs in order to secure a portion of the contract for printing of stamps.

The Prince Consort Essay was a surface printed printer's sample stamp created in 1850 as an example of the surface printed stamps that Henry Archer proposed to print and perforate under contract with the British government at a lower price than the current printing firm of Perkins Bacon. The Prince Consort stamps were provided by the artist Robert Edward Branston, from an engraving executed by Samuel William Reynolds.

Although commonly known as an essay, the stamp was not really an essay as it was never intended that a postage stamp be produced based on the design, nor was it an un-adopted design. It is more accurately described as a printer's sample stamp, or dummy stamp.
