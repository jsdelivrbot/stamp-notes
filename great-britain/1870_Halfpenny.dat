\chapter{1870 Halfpenny}    

In 1870 the postage on "Inland Newspapers" and on "Inland Printed Matter and Patterns or Samples not exceeding 2oz. in weight," was reduced to One Halfpenny. The new rates came into force on October 1st of that year and preparations were commenced in the previous April to provide stamps of that value.

\subsection{The Gumming and Perforation of the Halfpenny stamps.}

The gum used on the sheets of stamps was of precisely the same quality as that employed for the three higher values and according to the stipulations of the contract two coatings were applied, as in the case of those values. - The sheets were perforated at Somerset House by comb-machines with a guage
of 14 like the other values. 

It will be seen from the description we have given of the
perforation marks on the plates' that the sheets of Halfpenny stamps were placed
in the perforating machines with the stamps sideways and not like the three higher
values with the stamps in their correct positions, or, sometimes, inverted when the
sheets happened to be passed through the machines the wrong way up. The last row of Halfpenny stamps perforated on a sheet which was either the first or last
vertical row on the sheet in its correct position according to whichever end of the
sheet was first passed through the machine, was left imperforate along the bottom. Each sheet therefore, had the margin imperforate, either at the left side of the stamps
in the first vertical row or at the right side of the stamps in the last vertical row. In August, 1876," a complaint was made by the Inland Revenue Department
to Perkins, Bacon \& Co. that the double pinning mark was not observable at one end
of the sheets of Halfpenny stamps, which had then been recently received, and the
firm was asked to instruct their printers to take more care in inking the plates. 

As in the case of the three other values, sheets occasionally missed the perforation and specimens are known of Plates 1, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 14, which were issued in an imperforate condition. In some instances only certain specimens on the sheets were
imperforate, according to the following notice in one of the early philatelic journals:

\begin{blockquote}
We have just seen in a collection a pair of halfpenny English, evincing a most
singular freak of the perforating machine. Part of a sheet was purchased from a post
office ; and in the midst of tliis, were the two in question, which had totally escaped
perforation, either above, below, or at the sides ! " This error was probably the
result of one or two rows of perforation having been accidentally missed on this
particular sheet. The other sheets perforated along with it must also have had the same peculiarity.
\end{blockquote}

The difficulties in perforating the stamps is evident from all the blocks shown here.
