### Scottish Free Marks and Mails
The letter illustrated in Figure 1. is a good example of where, postal history blends with
__history__. Although interesting for postal historians as a Free mark, its great interest lies
within its historical context. I am sure it will be snapped up at a much greater value than the
estimate of the auctioneer, else it will fall ... under my custody!

Hugh Campbell (d. 20 Nov 1731) was the eldest son of James Campbell, 2nd
Earl of Loudoun (d. 1684), and Lady Margaret Montgomery (n.d.). He succeeded his
father as 3rd
Earl of Loudoun upon James' death in 1684 and took his seat in
Scotland's parliament on 8 Sep 1696. Upon the recommendation of the Earl of
Argyll, Campbell was appointed Extraordinary Lord of Session by King William in
1699. Under Queen Anne Campbell held the offices of Commissioner of the
Treasury, joint Secretary of State for Scotland, and Keeper of the Great Seal.
Following the ascension of King George I in 1714 he was sworn a privy councilor
and in 1715 was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ayrshire. 

Between 1722 and 1731
he was elected Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the {{wi:Kirk_of_Scotland}} six times.
Campbell served under John Campbell, 2
nd
Duke of Argyll, at the Battle of
Sheriffmuir in 1715 during the second major {{wi:Jacobite_rebellion}}. 

The {{wi:Earl_of_Mar}},
a former supporter of Queen Anne, began to amass forces in September of 1715
to join the English Jacobites in their effort to return a Stuart to the throne. Argyll
was placed in command of a combination of English and Scottish troops that
supported the Hanoverian government. 

The two armies met at Sheriffmuir on 13
November and engaged in a bloody battle. Argyll's men were outnumbered by
the Jacobites, but both sides took heavy casualties and there was no decisive
victory. The battle sapped the momentum of the uprising and it soon petered
out. After the rebellion had been quelled, Campbell had some success
interceding with the government on behalf of Jacobite prisoners

Hugh Campbell married Lady Margaret Dalrymple (4 Sep 1677-3 Apr 1777) on 6
Apr 1700. They had three children, John (1705-1782), Elizabeth (n.d.), and
Margaret (n.d.). Hugh Campbell died in Loudoun Castle, Ayrshire. John, who
took the title in 1731 following his father's death, is the namesake of Loudoun
County, VA.
