### Merchant Adventurer's Post (Corsini Correspodence)

The first concessions the merchants received were foreign merchants doing business in England. These merchants were known as Merchants Strangers. They were allowed their own messenger to carry their mails, provided that the messenger was approved by the English Master of the Posts. These letters were carried away by the merchants own ships and the letters had to deal only with commercial matters.  

The Company of Merchant Adventurers of London brought together London's leading overseas merchants in a regulated company, in the nature of a guild. Its members' main business was the export of cloth, especially white (undyed) broadcloth. This enabled them to import a large range of foreign goods.
