ROUEN TO LONDON - 'CORSINI' "BALE OF SILK" CONSIGNEE LETTER ENDORSED WITH MERCHANT GUILD-MARK; 
Attractive 7 Aug. 1573 EL (minor toning and with archival silk backing) 
[from Arnolfini in Rouen - per RL 11 June 1986 cat., lot 185; this item fully illustrated]
clearly addressed "Al Magro. Filippo Corsino in Londra" 
but unusually also with Corsini's own Guild Mark 
("F C" in shield shape endorsed "No.XI" - presumably the parcel number) 
and endorsed "fatto d'una mo. b[all]e sell mandato" (= with a bale of silk, by hand?). Rare thus; few Corsini letters have such a clear parcel endorsement.    	\soldp*{150}

The appearance of the extensive Corsini correspondence in the 1980s altered our understanding of the overseas post during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Letters carried by the Strangers' Post to and from the Continent were passed to and from the Thurn & Taxis Post, opened to the public in 1519 and, where relevant, to the French Post opened a little earlier. Most of the covers in these frames show manuscript charges to be paid on delivery or other postal endorsements; a few were chosen because of their content.

The Merchant Adventurers' Post, the post of the English merchants, was established in the 1580s. The letters identified as being from this post received charges in pence (e.g. 4 d), in contrast to the charges of the Strangers' Post which were in groats (e.g. G 2\halfd).

In frame 2 the 1579 cover from Paris to London makes mention of a carrier: '...I have received your last letter by this carrier, a new postboy named Jacques le Paincteur...'. Also in this frame are two ship letters from Hamburg.

The letter in frame 3 dated 1587 (illustrated, right) from Dieppe to London is one of the more scarce letters with a 4d charge of the Merchant Adventurers, and in frame 4 is one of 1597 with an 8d charge of the same post.

Before the establishment of a foreign post open to the public in 1632, some private letters were carried by the service organised by Mathew de Quester, the Postmaster General for foreign parts. The two letters of 1616 and 1626 in frame 4 were probably carried in this way.

The last cover in frame 4 was from a British mercenary serving with the forces of the United Provinces during the Eighty Years' War (the revolt of the Dutch Protestant provinces from the Spanish Empire).

2002  	 	LYONS TO LONDON - 'CORSINI' LETTER WITH 'SECOND HAND' LONDON ADDRESS; 23 Oct. 1574 EL (fine and with unusually clearly written contents - in Italian) from "Lione" to "Filippo Corsini a Londra" but most unusually also with a second English address added in a second hand; "To Mr. Corsyny in Grashe Strette" (Gracious St.). The letter has intriguing contents regarding trade, diplomacy, bankruptcy, news of a schooner being captured and navigation from the Straits (of Gibraltar?) becoming very dangerous, etc. 

Very few Corsini letters have this kind of extra English address - it may have been provided by the Merchant Adventurers' London City Post. [Ex Michael Jackson's Large Gold Medal Collection.]

2003  	 	PARIS TO LONDON - MERCHANT ADVENTURERS "d4" POSTAL RATE ENDORSED "P. VIA DE CALES"; 
Remarkable 30 Jan. 1580 EL (reinforced fold along edge does not detract; 
sealed with original wafer and with string still in place) 
to "Bartolomeo Corsini in Londra" with a very rare "<strong>d4</strong>" Merchant Adventurers 
charge on the front along with a separate "p via de Cales" routing endorsement. 
Written in Italian; advising the safe receipt of some goods. A very early date for this distinctive (Merchant Adventurers) "d"-style postage charge, of which only a small number are known (as opposed to the much commoner "g" - groat rates of the Merchant Strangers Post).
