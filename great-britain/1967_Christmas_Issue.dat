\chapter{1967 Christmas Issue}    

On November 27 1967 the Royal Post issued the normal Christmas issue. Christmas stamps
are printed in the millions and tend to produce more errors under the pressure to 
get such large volumes of postage by the deadline. The Queen's head as is normal for most of the commemorative stamps of the period was printed in gold and this colour is prone to errors.
