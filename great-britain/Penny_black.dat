## Penny Black

The Penny Black was printed from 11 plates, but as plate 1 was completely overhauled due to excessive wear, it is generally considered to be two separate plates, 1a and 1b. Plate 11 was originally intended solely for the printing of new red stamps, but a small number were printed in black. These are scarce.
The stamps were printed in unperforated sheets, to be cut with scissors for sale and use.

## Plates

The advent of the adhesive postage stamp officially began on May 6, 1840 with the release of the famous Penny Black and 2 days later the Tuppence Blue. Thus began a series of events that was to change how the world communicated. The early issues of Great Britain, from May 1840 until 1855, where printed almost exclusive using the line engraved (gravure, recess) printing method. Billions of stamps were printed using more than 480 printing plates. Most of these plates had 240 individual stamp images, all different, since, as a forgery precaution , "check" letters were placed in the corner squares with the stamp in the upper left hand corner being lettered AA and in the lower right hand corner being TL. 

For engraved stamps printed before 1864, the letters were individually punched into the printing plate. As this was done by hand, the position of the letters relative to the surrounding square varied and allows an expert to tell from what plate an individual stamp comes. These issues, that had the letters hand punched, all have letters in the 2 bottom squares only, the upper 2 square containing "stars". After 1864, line engraved issues had letters in all 4 corner squares, that were engraved, rather than punched into the printing plates, but more importantly also had the plate numbers engraved onto the stamp, making plating much simpler.
