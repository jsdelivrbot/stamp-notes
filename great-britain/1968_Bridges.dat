\chapter{1968 Bridges}    

The Post office issued four stamps on 29 April 1968, depicting famous British bridges.


\ph[80%]{../great-britain/1968-bridges.jpg}{1968 Bridges, the set of four values. }

The Tarr Steps nearly lost in 2012  are a medieval clapper bridge across the River Barle in the Exmoor National Park, Somerset, England.[ They are located in a National Nature Reserve about 2.5 miles (4 km) south east of Withypool and 4 miles (6 km) north west of Dulverton.

A typical clapper bridge construction, the bridge possibly dates to around 1000 BC. The stone slabs weigh up to 1-2 tons apiece. According to local legend, they were placed by the devil to win a bet. The bridge is 180 feet (55 m) long and has 17 spans. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument.

Half of the bridge was washed away by the river whilst heavily swollen by rain in December 2012. The bridge has now been re-assembled[4]
