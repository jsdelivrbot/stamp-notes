Sir Francis Charles Chichester KBE (17 September 1901--26 August 1972) was an accomplished aviator and sailor. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for becoming the first person to sail single-handed around the world by the clipper route, and the fastest circumnavigator, in nine months and one day overall.
