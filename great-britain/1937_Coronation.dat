\chapter{1937 Coronation Issue}

\section{The Need for the Issue}

On 14 December 1936 – four days after the abdication – the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Rt.
Hon. W. Ormsby Gore, wrote to Major Hardinge who had continued in post as Private Secretary
to the new King (Ref. 2a):

\begin{letter}

“Dear Alec,

You will remember that in July we had some correspondence about the design of
Colonial postage stamps and that it was eventually decided that they should each issue a few
denominations in a standard design, a specimen which I enclose, which would be delivered
to them in time for the stamps to be put on sale by the 12th of May 1937. The order for these
stamps was, as is customary, placed with the firm submitting the lowest tender and the design
selected was a simple one, the main feature of which was a portrait of the King. It is of course
out of the question now to proceed with the issue of these stamps and their preparation has
been suspended. As the Crown Agents inform me that we cannot simply keep the designs and
change the portrait of the Sovereign, new plates being required, it is necessary to consider what
other arrangements can be made.
The Colonies were informed of the proposals for the new stamps, and in the expectation
that they would have them by May next have naturally only ordered sufficient quantities of
their old stamps of the denominations concerned to tide them over until then. We must now
either order further quantities of the old King George V stamps, or have new stamps ready for
delivery in sufficient quantities by May 12th.
In the circumstances, I would propose to revert to the original idea of having a special
Coronation issue for the stamps of the whole Colonial Empire. My suggestion is that each
Dependency should have for issue on the 12th of May a set of three stamps (the actual
denominations to be left to the Dependencies to decide) and that every one of these stamps
Zealand stamps issued for the Silver Jubilee last year, but with some Coronation emblems
incorporated in the design. This Coronation issue would be in use only from the 12th of
May to the 31st of December 1937, when it would be replaced by new issues of stamps in all
Dependencies, for the preparation of which there would be ample time for consideration before
the beginning of 1938…”.
\end{letter}

The letter goes on to outline a timetable for the production of the issue and emphasises the urgency of obtaining the King's choice from any designs so as to allow printing to be completed in time.

This urgency was actually greater than it might appear because the Crown Agents had advised that shipments by sea to the most distant Colonies needed to be available for delivery by the end of January 1937 if they were to arrive in time (Ref. 2b).

\section{The Edward VIII Stamps}

It is relevant to consider the model for the effigy of Edward VIII that was being referred to in this
letter. It was not the same as the one used on the GB definitives that had been issued during 1936.
\begin{figure}

album page was re-mounted by BPMA staff but the captions are copied from Park’s original. The caption
over the Canadian stamp must refer to the portrait of the Queen. Reproduced by permission of the BPMA.}
\end{figure}

Some examples of the stamps described are in the Royal Philatelic Collection and they are
photogravure printings by Harrisons (Ref. 8). There are essays of pictorial stamps from some colonies
(from the De La Rue archives), and a die proof for an intaglio engraving by J.A.C. Harrison (for
Waterlow & Sons) also exists in the Harrison Collection at the British Library. Figure 2 shows the
copy of that proof and one of the essays. The King’s head is depicted in precisely the same pose on
all these. Although I have not found documentary evidence to confirm, it does seem certain that
the effigy is based on the official accession photograph taken by Hugh Cecil in early 1936

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../great-britain/king-edward.jpg}
\end{figure*}

The King is wearing the uniform of an admiral, with the heavily embroidered collar and bullion
epaulettes which were part of the full dress worn by British admirals of all ranks at this date (Note 1).

Amongst his decorations and honours, it is noteworthy that he wears the neck badge of the Grand Master of the Order of St Michael and St George, a position he had held since 1919 (Figs 2 and 11).

Shortly after this picture was taken, King Edward assumed the rank of Admiral of the Fleet, the uniform for which has an extra stripe at the sleeve cuff and different insignia on the epaulettes. He also relinquished the office of Grand Master OMG to his uncle, the Earl of Athlone. As the new Sovereign of the Order, he would have worn the GCMG neck badge but, in fact, later photographs
show him wearing that of the more senior Order of the Bath.

As I shall show, all these details are relevant when examining the depiction of King George VI in the Omnibus designs.

\section{Design Brief and the First Essays}

It is clear from the Secretary of State’s letter that the Coronation issue was only intended as a stopgap
measure. The advice that he quotes about the need for new designs was provided at a minuted
meeting between Colonial Office officials, the Crown Agents and the managers of the four printing
firms (Harrison & Sons, De La Rue & Co, Bradbury,Wilkinson & Co and Waterlow & Sons). This
was held on 11 December 1936 (Ref. 2b). Mr Ormsby Gore’s proposal was put to the printers who
agreed that, given an omnibus design and combining the printing work, they would be able to give
the required deliveries. One point of interest relates to the method of printing. It was agreed that
the only process “by which the required delivery could possibly be given was the recess process ….”.
Harrisons, therefore, withdrew from the arrangements. No reason is minuted for this conclusion
nor why intaglio would be preferable to letterpress or photogravure. A likely explanation is that
while letterpress, intaglio or photogravure would all allow for an omnibus design onto which could
be separately added the Colony’s name and stamp value, only intaglio printing could be done, in
the required numbers, by all the three printers, that is De La Rue, Bradbury and Waterlows. For
example a review of Colonial letterpress stamp printings at this date confirms that they were almost
exclusively from De La Rue.

The printers were advised that they could choose any portrait of the Queen. For the King, the photograph on the centre page of that day’s Daily Telegraph (11 December 1936) was suggested as suitable (Fig. 3) but, although that was probably used for Waterlows’ essay A (below), it was not the one for the approved design. The Coronation emblems to be included were also specified; they were the crown, orb, two sceptres or sceptre and sword, which indeed were all part of the final design.

\section{Evolution of the Final Design}

This part of the history has been recounted by Drysdall (Ref. 1) and in particular he points out that
the final design was a composite of three of the essays. A little repetition is appropriate in the light
of the extra information from the Colonial Office files.

Only Waterlows and De La Rue produced essays at this stage and they are reproduced here by
gracious permission (Fig. 4). There is a letter from the Colonial Office to Major Hardinge dated 18 December 1936 and it must have accompanied these essays (Ref. 2c). It actually shows that the idea of amalgamating the designs originated there. Their preference was as follows.

For general layout, the Colonial Office preferred 8c green, for the King’s portrait the 10c maroon and for the Queen they liked the 25c blue – all three by Waterlows. The quality of this last design rather suggests that it was by J.A.C. Harrison, Waterlows’ most famous engraver. As noted below,the King’s portrait on that design is very similar to others that are undoubtedly by him.

The King’s choice was different. A reply dated 22 December 1936 from Alan Lascelles (then the Assistant Private Secretary, Ref. 2d) confirms the account in a letter that was written one year later from the Crown Agents to the Keeper of the Royal Philatelic Collection and which is quoted by Drysdall (Ref. 1). The King preferred the layout of the 5c blue by Waterlows “but with the portraits not enclosed by ovals” (marked A in Figure 4). For the Queen he chose the De La Rue design, but for his own portrait he agreed with using the 10c maroon (marked B in figure 4). The new amalgamated or composite designs, together with die proofs from the three printers, were available for the Secretary
of State to choose from on 14 January 1937 and the De La Rue design was chosen (Ref. 2e & 2f). This design, as the issued stamp with the component elements chosen by the King, is illustrated in Figure 5.

\section{Source Photographs for the Portrait in the Final Designs}

This subject has recently been reviewed in the Newsletter of the British Royal Portraits Stamps
Group, so some of what follows is reproduced with the editor’s permission (Ref. 4). A letter from
the Colonial Office to Alan Lascelles is dated 30 December 1936 (Ref. 2g).

\begin{letter}
Dear Lascelles,

I promised to send you a line to let you know from whose photographs the designs for the
Colonial Coronation stamps recently approved by Their Majesties were taken. We have now
heard that the photographs were those of Bertram Park of 43 Dover Street, W.1., and the firm’s
numbers are as follows:-

No 03259B for that of the King, and No 01953G for that of the Queen.

\closing{Yours sincerely E B Boyd}

\end{letter}

Those photographs are illustrated in Figure 6.

\begin{marginfigure}

of York by Marcus Adams that was published in the
Daily Mail on 11 December 1936 with the Waterlow
essay that was probably by J.A.C. Harrison. The

appears to be based on this photograph. Photograph

\end{marginfigure}
The photograph of the Queen has been known for many years, having first been published in
Stamp Collecting in August 1937 (Ref. 3) to illustrate an interview with Bertram Park. It was taken in 1932 and was used by Perkins Bacon for the Newfoundland 7c definitive that year. In the final design for the omnibus, De La Rue’s artist has brought the shoulders forward (in accordance with the “full face” requirement of the brief) and added the ribbon of the Order of the Garter. This is also drawn on all the Waterlow essays (Fig. 4) but not on De La Rue’s first submission. It was not strictly necessary, although the designers had presumably heard that the King had appointed the Queen to the Order on his birthday, three days after accession. Members of the order may wear the Insignia immediately after appointment (without awaiting formal investiture). However the Queen
does not seem to have done so. Indeed, on the GB Coronation stamp she is portrayed - from a
photograph chosen by the King himself (Ref. 10) – wearing an Order of the Royal Family and that
of the Crown of India but not the Garter.


Surprisingly, the King’s photograph has only recently been traced (Ref. 4). As noted below, the
number of the photograph was identified as part of some research into the New Zealand Coronation
issue, but the actual picture was not found (Ref. 5). In fact, it was on file at the British Postal Museum
& Archive (BPMA), but it had not been linked to any stamp design nor is it mentioned in Ref. 3.
De La Rue’s artist has drawn the uniform of an admiral to replace the lounge suit. In the first
essay there is not much detail, but as will be described, doing this led to an error, which had to be
corrected on the actual die prior to printing.

Part of the reason for the delayed recognition lies with Bertram Park himself. An album of
stamps and photographs that he compiled is at the BPMA. The relevant page is illustrated (Fig. 7).
The photograph shown of the King is one taken by Peter North and it was used both by Canada
(for a Coronation commemorative) and Australia for some definitives. However, Park also places
the colonial Coronation omnibus, the New Zealand Coronation issue and the Southern Rhodesia
definitive issue all on the same page. A sheet of typescript signed by Park is with the album and it states:

\begin{letter}
“The printing of the Colonial Coronation issues was divided among the three printers normally
employed by the Crown Agents, the portrait of the King was copied from the photograph by
Peter North and that of the Queen from my own portrait”.
\end{letter}

This assertion is repeated by Easton in fourth edition of British Postage Stamp Design (Ref. 6). While it has to be said that neither Waterlows’ essay “B”, chosen by the King, nor the De La Rue first essay looks very close to the photograph in Figure 6, the effigy on the issued stamp matches it exactly in posture and the highlights on the hair. Combined with the letter quoted above and other references in Colonial Office files (2h & j) there seems to be no reasonable cause for doubt that Park’s assertion was incorrect. The photograph illustrated in Figure 6 was the one used, although
some contradictory information is noted below.

The letter from De La Rue to the Crown Agents that accompanied their first essays is dated
18 December 1936 (Ref. 9). This has been quoted by Drysdall (Ref. 1), so it is only included here as
an appendix for ease of reference. However, the following passages are worth quoting.
The portraits are taken from photographs that we have obtained from Bertram Park, but we have
included an Admiral’s uniform in the portrait of the King and have adjusted the photograph
of H M The Queen so that the shoulders face the front of the stamp ...
In order to save time, should this design by accepted, we have already put in hand the engraving
and could submit the proof of the original die on January 11th. (author’s underlining)
This second passage must refer in part to the separate working of the King’s portrait by the
engraver in Edinburgh as recounted by Marcus Faux and quoted by Drysdall (Ref. 1). (In fact Faux’
account first appears in Geosix July 1982, Ref. 7).
The photographs used by the various designers at Waterlows are not documented in any
contemporary letter except for one curious reference in an exchange of letters quoted by Drysdall
(Ref. 1) and which has survived in the De La Rue archive at the BPMA (Ref. 9).
Firstly, from Waterlows to De La Rue, 24 September 1936:
We send herewith as arranged a photo-print of each of the two selected designs and the
photograph of H.M. King George VI by Bertram Park. Kindly acknowledge receipt. Would you
please hand to the bearer as arranged, the large photograph of H.M. Queen Elizabeth utilised
for your design and also a photo-print of your rough design.
De La Rue replied 24 December 1936:

We acknowledge receipt of the photo-print of each of the two selected designs marked ‘A’ and
‘B’ and also the photograph of H.M. King George VI by Bertram Park number 01953H. We
confirm that the photograph from which our portrait of H.M. the Queen was taken is also by
Bertram Park number 01953G ….

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../great-britain/coronation-07.jpg}
\caption{Photograph No. 01953H by Bertram Park. This picture of the King was taken when
he was Duke of York and must date from before his promotion to Rear Admiral
in June 1932. Reproduced by permission of the BPMA.}
\end{marginfigure}

As stated by Drysdall, this correspondence must relate to the printers exchanging material to allow each firm to essay the required composite designs and it implies
that Waterlows had used photograph 01953H as their model for the
King (otherwise why should they send it to De La Rue?). None the less,
all the Colonial Office minutes and letters, as well as the similarity of
the design to the photograph, indicate that 03259B was used.
One other discordant piece of information is an invoice dated
3 May 1937, from De La Rue to the Crown Agents for reimbursement
of £6 paid to Bertram Park for the rights to use photographs numbered
01953H and 01953G, while 03259B is not mentioned.

Photograph 01953 H is also filed at the BPMA (Fig. 8) and like
that of the Queen it dates from 1932. The King is still in a Royal Navy
captain’s uniform with white collar and braid (he was promoted to
Rear Admiral in 1932). Even allowing for the fact that the Waterlows’
essay ‘B’ is only a drawing, it matches the lounge suit photograph in
Figure 6 far better than this one. However, if in fact Figure 8 was the
one that Waterlows used then an explanation is required as to why that
is not the one in the accepted final design. In this respect De La Rue’s
speed off the mark in commencing engraving before 18 December
1936 is probably relevant. Returning to the story from Marcus Faux,
the engraver in Edinburgh had worked all over Christmas (but had
Hogmanay off) to finish his part of the die by 7 January when it was
collected by Mr McKay, Chief Inspector of Stamps for the Crown
Agents. Assembly of the combined die was completed and the proof
printings were approved by 14 January 1937 (Ref. 2e & f, which are
Colonial Office minutes also noting that, in any case, it was too late to make alterations to the dies).
\begin{marginfigure}

the King in the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet and

than just the head and collar but still not enough to

\end{marginfigure}
Thus, if it had only then been realised that the engraving was not based on a design chosen by the
King, it would have been too late to start again. Either the King had chosen Waterlows’ design that was based on the photograph 03259B from which De La Rue had already commenced engraving or else his choice was changed in some unrecorded decision.

All of Waterlows’ designers seemed to have used the same portrait of the Queen. Its origin is not documented, but it appears to have been taken from a portrait of the Duke of York’s family by Marcus Adams, which appeared in both the Times and the Daily Mail on 11 December 1936 (Fig. 9). The photograph was also used for an unaccepted essay for the GB Coronation stamp from Harrisons (Ref. 10). It is perhaps hardly surprising that the King preferred the portrait used by De La Rue.

\section{Admiral’s Uniform}

At accession, the new King assumed the rank of Admiral of the Fleet. and so this had to be the uniform which was combined, by De La Rue’s designer, with the King’s head from the lounge suit photograph in Figure 6.

Bertram Park, Peter North and Dorothy Wilding all took photographs of the King in this uniform. Bertram Park’s photograph is the familiar three-quarter West facing head (Fig. 10) used for many Colonial stamps. However, on most of those stamps only the head and uniform collar is shown and this is no different from that worn by admirals of any rank at this period. Even the most expansive views of this photograph (Cyprus high values, SG162/3 or Cook Islands 1s, SG127) do not permit one really to see the rank markings on the epaulettes which were, in fact, the only distinguishing feature of the uniform, apart from the sleeve stripes. However, those photographs were not available
so soon after the accession. As noted, De La Rue had already started engraving by 18 December,
so the designers had to choose another model. This seems to have been the picture of Edward VIII
illustrated at the beginning of this paper (Fig. 2). All three printers probably had a copy of this picture
because, as noted, their various stamp essays for that reign show that King Edward’s head was taken
from this photograph. Actually, it does not show him as an Admiral of the Fleet, but simply as an
admiral (with three stars on the epaulettes). This is not apparent on most stamp size effigies but on
the Southern Rhodesia definitive (Fig. 12) one of the three stars can be seen on the left epaulette.
As noted above, King Edward’s photograph also shows the neck badge of the Grand Master of the
Order of St Michael and St George. This is a position never held by George VI who in any case was
almost always photographed wearing the neck badge of the more senior Order of the Bath (the Royal
visit to the USA in 1939 is an exception). However colour proofs that are at the British Library for the
composite designs and those in the Royal Philatelic Collection show this badge on the Waterlow and
Bradbury versions. They are illustrated here (Figs 11, 12 and 13). That must also have been the case
for the De La Rue version because only after the engraving had been started was this error noted. A
Colonial Office minute (Ref. 2h) dated 30 December 1936, mentions this and the writer requested
to know urgently what should be substituted (Note 2). Enquires were made with Alan Lascelles at
Sandringham and ... “he thinks that in the circs. the insignia of a GCMG should be shown” (i.e. the
Grand Cross of St Michael and St George which is worn by the Sovereign of the Order).
This message was passed to De La Rue by the Crown Agents’ Stores Department on 31 December
1936 (Ref 2h).
The two badges are shown in Figure 11 together with a detail from the De La Rue stamp design.
The thin arms of the star as depicted on the stamp do suggest that the intervening elements of the
intertwined M & G with Crown had been obliterated from the die, but interestingly the colour
proofs from Waterlow and Bradbury were not altered (e.g. Fig. 11).

\section{Printing and Distribution of the Issue}

As is well recorded, this was done by De La Rue and Bradbury, Wilkinson producing 135 dies and plates between them. It is often stated that Waterlows’ tender was unsuccessful, but the Colonial Office records include a letter and minutes which confirm that they actually withdrew due to prior commitments (Ref. 2i). Thus, between them, De La Rue and Bradburys were initially contracted to print nearly 100 million stamps to send to the Colonies (Letter from Crown Agents dated 16 January 1937 in De La Rue archive - Ref . 9). In fact, another Crown Agents’ letter written in June 1937 (2i) records a further 30-40 million being sold to dealers in London, with their staff working 12 hours and over each day, for weeks, to complete the distribution. Towards the deadline date, De La Rue had to run their presses at a higher speed than they thought desirable.

The value of these latter sales was £266,000 and the Crown Agents had to make special
arrangements with the GPO to collect the parcels for distribution to these dealers, with a total weight of seven tons.

The first stamps to distant Colonies were indeed despatched in early February 1937 (Fiji on 11 February, Solomon Islands and Gilbert and Ellice Islands on 16 February – Ref 2i), However, the demand from some Colonies, (e.g. Ceylon) for millions of stamps could only be partly met by Coronation day. Further requisitions came in from the Colonies after that because, it was presumed, local stocks were depleted by the large demand from philatelists. The total sales exceeded £300,000 or about £7,000 per Colony (Ref. 2i). Although the Colonies were making arrangements for their new George VI definitive series, many of these were not available until 1938, so this “stopgap” issue was required for much longer than originally planned.

\section{Use of the King's Portrait on Dominion Issues}

The same photograph in Figure 6 with the admiral’s uniform was certainly used for the Southern
Rhodesian definitives (SG 40-52) and Coronation Commemorative stamps (SG 36-39) that were
printed by Waterlows. The head pose is identical to the photograph. A die proof in the Harrison
collection at the British Library (Fig. 12) confirms that the Southern Rhodesia definitive was engraved
by J A C Harrison. It is also noteworthy that it was not felt necessary to correct the neck badge for
these stamps. Also, its similarity to the Waterlows 25c blue essay for the Coronation Omnibus does
suggest that this essay was also his design.

New Zealand’s Coronation Commemoratives (SG 599-601) were also based on the same
photographs of the King and Queen, but have obviously been re-engraved by Bradbury Wilkinson (Fig, 13). In fact, it was enquiries about this issue in 1956 that led to the identification of the correct photograph number (Ref. 5), although at that stage the actual picture was not traced. A letter from the Director General of the GPO at Wellington stated:

\begin{letter}
Photographs that were the work of Bertram Park were used for the 1937 Coronation series. That of King George VI was numbered 03259B while that of Her Majesty the Queen was 01953E. The original of the late King was in a lounge suit and was adapted by the printers, Messrs Bradbury Wilkinson & Co when details of the uniform were obtained.
\end{letter}

In this quote, 01953E is either a misprint for 01953G or it refers to one of the very similar
photographs taken at the same sitting an example of which is in the National Portrait Gallery.
In January 1937 the Canadian High Commission requested details about the approved design and
the photographs that had been used for these stamps (Ref. 2j) although in the event they used Peter
North’s photograph for the King on their Coronation stamp as did Australia for their definitives.
Finally, the Government of Newfoundland telegraphed the Colonial Office on 19 December
1936 (Ref. 2k)
In the interests of postal revenue, we are most anxious to have complete Coronation issue
embracing all denominations to be put on sale for the period 12th.May to 31st.December.
We, therefore urge that arrangements hitherto agreed upon for denominations other than 2, 4
and 5 cents should stand. Please cable immediately if we may ask Dickinson’s to get in touch
with you and if necessary British Post Office to obtain approved design of the King’s head to
be used in vignette in connection with existing design.
This last phrase rather suggests that the pictorial element of the design used for the Additional
Coronation Issue from Newfoundland (SG257-267) had originally been planned to be issued for
Edward VIII’s Coronation (Fig. 18).
The Colonial Office reply was to approve this (subject, of course to the King’s agreement) and the
printers (Dickinsons) were to get in touch with the Crown Agents for the approved effigy. Hence,
the tiny picture in the vignette on these stamps is a copy of the final De La Rue version with the
modified neck badge.

\section{Coda}

In November 1937, the Crown Agents received a letter (Ref. 2l) from Albert Mitchell who presented a radio programme in New York called The Answer Man:

\begin{letter}
I have had many inquiries as to why on the Coronation stamps, the Colonies (many of them)
have the King on a different side than the English stamps? I was told that the reason why the
Queen is portrayed on the King’s left is because she sits on his left on all state occasions. Is
there any explanation why the Colony stamps are reversed?
\end{letter}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../great-britain/coronation-03.jpg}
\caption{The badges of the Order of St Michael and St George. The Grand Cross is on the left and the Grand
Master’s badge is second left. Third is a detail from a coronation omnibus stamp showing the King with the
GCMG while the unaccepted colour proof from Bradburys (right) shows the erroneous Grand Master’s badge that
was corrected by De La Rue before printing. The colour proof is reproduced by permission of the British Library.}
\end{figure*}
In fact, of course, the difference was that the GB Coronation stamp was based on a proper
photograph of the King and Queen by Dorothy Wilding in which the Queen was on the King’s
left, in accordance with protocol. The Coronation Omnibus was simply based on a rushed decision that the Queen should be shown on the King’s right as in the Canadian Tercentenary Issue of 1908 (SG 188 and 190) and the New Zealand Jubilee Issue of 1935 (SG 573-575) which (in the words of a minute) “were the only precedents we could find” (Ref. 2l, letter from the Crown Agents to the Colonial Office and Ref. 2a, letter from the Secretary of State quoted at the beginning of this paper).
It was presumably not desirable to state this specifically so Mr Mitchell was simply advised that “no
significance attaches to the relative position of their Majesties’ portraits on these stamps".

design. On the right is one of the Southern Rhodesia definitives with detail showing the neck badge, while

indicate that those were also his work using photograph 03259B (Fig 6). Note that on the essay, the King
is depicted wearing the badge of the Order of the Bath whilst on all the others he wears, incorrectly, the
Grand Master’s Badge (Figure 11). The epaulettes on the Southern Rhodesia stamp are also copied from
the King Edward VIII photograph in Figure 2 and are not those of an Admiral of the Fleet.
