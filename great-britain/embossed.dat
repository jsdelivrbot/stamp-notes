## Embossed Stamps

The Embossed series were all imperforate and were issued in three values 1/-, 10d and 6d.  Although embossing of stamps for revenue in Great Britain had a long tradition as postage stamps it was a failed experiment. The introduction of the Uniform Penny Postal System had proven to be a great success and grew rapidly.  The line-engraved postage stamps were not produced quickly or economically enough to keep up with the demand.

The surface printed postage stamps produced by De la Rue were to be the ultimate solution to the problem. The embossed issues form a curious experiment that fell to the wayside as postal authorities searched for the best way to manufacture postage stamps.

Perhaps the most curious aspect of these stamps is that they were impressed into the paper by hand one stamp at a time.  A crude and laborious method which seems out of place with the technological advances being heralded during the Victorian Period.  The design of the embossed stamps is derived from the Wyon  City Medal of 1837, the same source for the design of the Penny Black.  The awkward means of production insured that many of the impressions overlapped and as a resulted it is rather difficult to obtain four margin copies. 
  
The gum employed was common arabic of a yellowish tinge, frequently imparting a similar hue to the paper. The gum was applied thickly, and the the operation was performed after the stamps were struck, for the cavities caused by the embossing are frequently found to be filled with gum.<sup>1</sup>

### 10d Brown (Date of Issue, 6th November, 1848)

When the postage to France was reduced from tenpence to fourpence, on 1 January, 1855, the issue of this stamp was suspended <sup>2</sup>. The remaining stock was issued for a temporary requirement in 1863 some fifteen years after it was issued.

 They had a very short life span. The most notable thing with these stamps is that they were printed one at a time. This resulted in most stamps touching the design of the next stamp, if not overlapping it. In many cases, when you see a row or block of these stamps, the alignment is terrible. This is the reason that these stamps are catalogued so highly. The price is based on a stamp with clear margins and these are scarce. There are many collectors who have been duped into paying way over the odds for these stamps, simply because they have no understanding of what the catalogue price is based on. Because the stamps were of an Octagonal design with a white border, many were cut to shape, thus removing this border and these are worth only a fraction of the value of cut square stamps. 

Care should be taken when buying the 6d value. As the die for this stamp was later used in producing the pre paid embossed envelopes. Many envelopes were cut and the stamp sold as being the Embossed 6d value. These have very little value when sold by their true identity.

### Specimens

Copies of the embossed stamps can be found found overprinted \textsc{SPECIMEN}. Although copies of the one penny adhesive stamp had been forwarded to every postmaster previously to its issue, with instructions to preserve them in order to compare them in case of doubt with the stamps on the letters passing through the office, they were not surcharged with the word <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-size:0.7em">SPECIMEN</span>. This overprint, as applied to adhesives, appears first on these stamps.
