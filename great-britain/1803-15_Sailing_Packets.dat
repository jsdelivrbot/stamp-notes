\chapter{The Packet Service 1803-15}    


\section{Disinfection}

As soon as a packet arrived at Falmouth from overseas, the medical inspector would visit the vessel, in order to give the vessel \textit{pratique.} Pratique was the license given to a ship to enter port on assurance from the captain to convince the authorities that she is free from contagious disease. If the vessel came from the plague-ridden Meditterenean or the West Indies the vessel had to be fumigated as well. 

The letters on the guarantine vessel were placed into fumigated boxes where they were
exposed to fumes which were the result of mixing one part of sulfur to two parts powder charcoal. This lasted for at least 15 minutes after which the letters were taken out by tongs and dipped in vinegar before they were considered safe for handling.
