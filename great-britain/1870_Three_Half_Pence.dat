\chapter{1870 Three Halfpence} 

Bacon found no document relating to the colour selected for the stamps of 1870, which was entirely different to that of the stamps printed in 1860. The colour chosen was " lake-red," and this was continued throughout the issue, which terminated in 1880, when Perkins, Bacon \& Co.'s contract for the supply of the stamps
ceased. 

In the course of these ten years, the colour varied a good deal in shade and
frequently approached very closely to that of the One Penny value. On February
17th, 1872 1 Mr. Ormond Hill wrote to Mr. J. P. Bacon to enquire why tlie Threehalfpence stamps were "printed in a colour so different from the mauve tint originally selected and whether there would be any difficulty in reverting to the original color
if it were desired " ; and he added : " The present color seems much too near to that of the id. stamps." We have found no reply to this letter, so conclude Mr.
Hill's enquiry was answered at a private interview. (Bacon, p.189).

\subsection{The Watermark and Perforation of the Three-halfpence stamps.}

The stamps issued were printed on the "Large Crown" watermarked paper of 1861 and were perforated 14 at Somerset House. A few specimens of each plate escaped perforation, as imperforate pairs are known of both Plates i and 3. As in the case of the One Penny and Two Pence values' a trial printing was made about
1870 on Dr. Perkins' chemically prepared "Large Crown" watermarked paper. These stamps which were printed from Plate I, were gummed, but were left imperforate.

Contract for printing the Three-halfpence stamps. No specific contract was entered into between the Board of Inland Revenue and
Perkins, Bacon \& Co. for the printing of the Three-halfpence value, but the stamps
were produced by mutual agreement on the same terms as the One Penny and Two
Pence values.
