THE FAMOUS WALLACE DOCUMENT

The Earliest Dated Penny Black in Existence

Unique document from the archive of Robert Wallace: die proof of the Mulready, without value tablet, printed in black on India paper, mounted on stout paper along with an unused 1d black from plate 1a, lettered AI, with endorsement in pencil by Robert Wallace MP: 1st Proof of Penny Postage Stamp Cover(?), presented to Mr. Wallace by the Right Honourable Chancellor of the Exchequer, Francis Thornhill Baring, April 10th 1840. along top, with Universal Penny Postage Fly or Loose Stamp, presented to me as above (the 10th April). / These came into public use on the 6th May 1840 below the Penny Black.

The Penny Black affixed comes from the plate completed on April 8th 1840, which was put into production on April 11th and officially registered on April 15th.

Note: This stamp, from the first row of the sheet, quite probably comes from the first sheet printed.

April 10th was also an important day for the Mulready, as it was the day that its design was shown to and approved by the Council of Royal Academicians. Unique document of major historical importance in the story of the Penny Black.

Expertise: certified by James Grimwood-Taylor (1992) and BPA (2009) Note: Robert Wallace (1733-1855), was one of the foremost Postal Reformers of the 1830s and 1840s. According to Rowland Hill's autobiography, Robert Wallace was One who was in the field (of Postal Reform) more than two years before I began my investigations.

Wallace began the campaign in 1833 that led to cheap postage and the 1d black. He was a principal witness for the Commission of Revenue Enquiry into the Post Office from 1835 to 1836, and it was by his deciding vote as Chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Postage in 1838 that the original proposals for cheap postage were recommended to Parliament.
