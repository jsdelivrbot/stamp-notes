###Edmund Dummer's Packet Service


{{wi:Edmund_Dummer}} was glancingly referred to in Samuel Pepys's diary around the time, in 1694, when Dummer held the appointment of Surveyor-general to the Navy and supervised the construction of a number of exceptionally fast packet-boats for the Post-Office packet service from Harwich to the Low countries. (Alan W. Robertson, A History of Ship's Letters, p.B8/A.)
Falmouth had been chosen to be Britain's westward packet-station by the Post Office in 1688, with mail packet services commencing to the Groyne (Corunna, Spain) in January 1689,  changing to Lisbon from 1702, when Spain was at war.  

Dummer proposed a monthly service to be operated by four oceangoing packets (Sloops) calling at Barbadoes, Antigua, Montserrat, Nevis and Jamaica.  On June 30th, 1702, the Crown came to terms with Dummer agreeing his plan and granting special concessions.  He was permitted to fly the Queen's colours on his ships, his crews were exempted from impressment for naval service, and he was granted a letter of marque for the duration of the War of the Spanish Succession which had commenced in the same year.  The first transatlantic mail service directly sponsored by the Post Office was inaugurated on October 21st, 1702, with the sailing from Portsmouth for Barbadoes of  (Dummer's) packet Bridgeman (qf. Alan W. Robertson,  A History of Ship's Letters, p.B.8/A.)

LEB : During the period 1699-1702, Edmund Dummer, while suspended as Surveyor to the Navy, had been devoting his energies to studying the problems of a regular Packet Service between the United Kingdom and the British Island Plantations in the West Indies.

In a document dated 18th June 1702 he (Dummer) set out the "Terms for settling a monthly intelligence between England and the Island Plantations in the West Indies."   

1.  If hired, to serve by the tun (Ton) - 10s. per tun per month - the Queen to victual the men, and to provide guns and gunners.
     [Note: 1 'TUN' = 2 Pipes, 4 Hogsheads or 252 'Old' wine gallons.]
2.  The biggest two sloops (134 tuns) must carry 28 men and boys, and 12 guns each.
3.  The Queen to reserve to herself the benefits of all letters, and
     To grant letters of marque to each vessel during war,
     To protect the men
     The Packets to wear the Queen's colours
     To have the benefits of all passengers, and parcels, except letters.
     To be exempt from light money (dues) and other port charges.
The scheme proposed was "to be worked by 4 vessels, to maintain an intercourse with Barbadoes (sic), Antegoa (sic), Montserrat, Nevis and Jamaica.

Two of the first vessels to sail were the sloops Bridgeman and Mansbridge, which had operated on a mail service between Gravesend and Brill in 1699 and 1700. Two further ships, the King William, of 90 tons and 8 guns, and the Frankland of 132 tons and 10 guns, were purchased to start the service.

The Commanders of the Packets were nominated by Dummer and granted commissions in the Royal Navy for the duration of their service with the Mail Ships.  The monthly pay of the Commander was Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£10; Chief Mate Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£5; Surgeon Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£4; Second Mate, Gunner and Carpenter Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£3. 10s each; Boatswain Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£3; Able Seaman Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£2; Ordinary Seaman Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£1. 10s.; Boy Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£1.   Difficulty was experienced, however, in recruiting crews for the West India run; the men were away from home much longer than those on the Lisbon run; there was a definite health risk in the West Indies; and if captured out there men might not live long enough to be exchanged.

In 1705 a new contract was drawn up to run for at least 3 years, or  5 years if the War continued.  Under this a monthly service was to be maintained by a fleet of 5 vessels; Dummer was to receive Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£12,500 per annum, and was to be allowed to carry for his own profit, 5 tons of freight on the outward journeys, and 10 tons on the homeward runs.  In return, he was to accept all risks to the ships and was responsible for replacements if they were lost or captured; further he guaranteed that the Post Office would receive Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£8,000 per annum from the mail and passengers carried.  For this new contract 5 new ships were built: Queen Anne, Prince George, Jamaica, Barbadoes and Antegoe.
Each of these vessels was of 200 tons, armed with 20 guns, and with two decks; they were also fitted with 24 oars apiece to enable them to escape from attacking vessels in the calms, often met with in the Caribbean. [Qf. LEB p.9]

Zachary Rogers was Packet Agent in Flushing from 9/8/1705 to his death in 1711. [The year of Dummer's bankruptcy]
It is surmised that Samuel Trefusis, who had a very close relationship with Sir Robert Cotton, Postmaster General (1691-1708), his father-in-law, wanted Dummer to base his contracted vessels operation from the large store he had built behind the quay at Flushing.
Dummer, though, having superintended the construction of the new Dock, was more inclined to favour Plymouth. [There must be information detailing Dummer's operation in Falmouth (and Plymouth) which would indicate how the service was managed by Zachary Rogers...If anyone can shed some light ... please e-mail me!]

In nine years, Dummer lost two packets at sea and had seven captured. His remaining seven packets were seized by creditors & the service lapsed. It was not until 1745 that the Post Office reintroduced a Service to the West Indies, - on Dummer's original plans, in response to demands from merchants, due to the growth of British interests in Sugar Plantations.

Dummer's case for debt with Nicholas Goodwin involved the Navy Board as he (Dummer) was a contractor for iron and timber at Portsmouth, and had timber at Chatham. (See Sergison Papers, at NMM.)

Although Falmouth was chosen as the most suitable port from which the Packets were to operate, the point of departure was definitely changed to Plymouth in 1705.  [Ref: Dummer had superintended building of the Dock at Plymouth]
The return port often had to be changed owing to adverse weather conditions or the activity of privateers.  
In 1706, Falmouth complained that the Packets were often returning to other ports, and lodged a protest with the Postmaster General, mentioning specifically two instances involving the Prince George and the Antegoe" [qf. LEB p.7]

In a reply to the P.M.G., dated 24 July 1706, Dummer gave some details of the preceding 12 voyages. Including;

12: Antegoe chased by seven Privateers into St. George's Channel, then came in by Lands End, delivered the Mail in Mounts Bay, but for reasons contained in an abstract of Captain Noble's Letter, could not recover Falmouth.

LEB p. 8: Antegoe sailed from Plymouth on 26 February 1705/6 and landed mails at Mounts Bay 113* days later, on 20 June 1706. [*115 ]
Antego next sailed from Plymouth on 9 August 1706 and returned to Falmouth 123 days later, on 11 December 1706.

Notes  

"Letters known to have been carried by the Dummer packets are exceedingly rare"  


Extract from two pages headed "Postal History" pages 75 & 77 - courtesy of the Post Office Archives, Mount Pleasant, London.
"A rarity overlooked - a 1711 Dummer Packet' cover."  By James Grimwood-Taylor.
[ Owner & Managing Director of CAVENDISH Philatelic Auctions, Derby, DE1 2SY.]

 "The only postmark is the London " IV/25 " Bishop Mark shown on the reverse.
Despite this, it is possible to deduce both the date and the place of origin of the cover. [p.75]

 "London's Bishop Marks were used from 1661 to 1787 and beyond, but with experience one can date them by eye to the nearest decade or so, simply by their size, ink and appearance.

The example on my part cover, is addressed "to Mr. Alexander Keith in Edinburgh" is clearly of the pre-1720 type.  The month is above the day which would indicate a pre-1714 date on an internal British letter, but there are indications that this letter originated overseas and so the Bishop Mark could be that of the London Foreign Branch, which retained the ',Month on top' format right through from 1661 to 1797.  The Inland Bishop Mark had the 'month below' format from mid-1713 onwards.  (Form 1661 to 1713, both Inland and Foreign Branch Bishop Marks had the month in the upper half of the circle.)"

p.75: "It is the endorsement " p the Evelin Packett" (sic) which tells us that this letter came to England from overseas.

The word "Packett" indicates a ship owned or commissioned by the Post Office to carry mail.
So a PO ship called the EVELIN carried this letter.This is confirmed by the postal rates, which are very helpful in determining the date of the cover.

Just above the second half of the word "Edinburgh" in the address is an unusual manuscript mark in a different ink, which is clearly a postal charge.  Although this charge is not very clear, it can only be "1/6" written rather untidily.  At the top left of the address is the final postal charge "In all 2N".  The latter is very clear, and shows the final charge for the letter's carriage from its place of origin to London, plus the inland postage on to Edinburgh.

The inland charge for a letter sent between London and Edinburgh was 5d between 1660 and 1711, but it was 6d from 1711 until 1784.  So the pieces of the postal history jigsaw begin to fall into place; the charges indicate a 1s 6d rate to London, and a 6d rate on from London to Edinburgh.  A date close to, but after, the change to the new postal rates in 1711 (on 1 June, as outlined in the 1710 Act of Parliament) is indicated.

The other endorsement is equally important.  There were very few early 18th century PO packet ship services, but the names of the ships that have operated the most famous service of the period - the "Dummer Packets" to the West Indies - are recorded.

The Dummer packet service ran from 21 October 1702 until 20 June 1711, (which) was set up largely thanks to the efforts of a private entrepreneur, Edmund Dummer, who had had experience running the packets to Portugal. [CHECK if not East Coast packets?]
[NOTE: This implies Dummer's service was actually from 1689-1701 to Corunna, and from 1701- to Lisbon. (War of Spanish Succession(1701-1713). Clearly, more research is required regarding the Post Office packet service pre-1702...]  -

Initially, single letters were charged 9d to or from London via Falmouth, but this was increased to 1s 6d early in 1705.

Twenty-two sloops were used, and one of them is recorded as having been the EVELYN.
This ship's tonnage is not recorded, but is known to have been used as a packet ship by Dummer in 1710. (SOURCE ?)

Although the EVELYN (sic) is only recorded as working on Dummer's West India route in 1710, it is not surprising that the ship's involvement continued into 1711, the last year of the service.  To summarise my conclusions....
(1) The letters was charged 6d postage from London to Edinburgh, so it cannot date from before June 1711.
(2) The letter was carried by the EVELYN of Edmund Dummer's West India packet Service which service was terminated on 20 July 1711.  (No ships were despatched from England after this date, the last Packet - the MARTLETT - returned from the final voyage on 19 December, 1711.   My cover is the latest "Dummer Packet" cover to have been recorded to date; the others are dated between 1705 and 1709).

Thus my letter reached London in 1711, and its importance and rarity are clear, when one realises that; "Letters known to have been carried by the Dummer packets are exceedingly rare"  to quote Thomas Foster's 'The Postal History of Jamaica, 1662-1860 published by, and still available from, Robson Lowe Ltd.)
"There are now at least nine named Dummer Packet covers recorded, including mine; they were sent by the PRINCE GEORGE (1), QUEEN ANNE (1), the FRANKLIN, FRANKLAND* (4)  the ANTEGOE (1), the RESOLUTION (1), and the EVELYN, EVELIN (1).  There are 7 other 'Dummer' covers merely endorsed "per the Packet" or such like.  That makes a total of only 16 Dummer packet covers recorded to date, in archives or in private hands; all are addressed to London except my 1711 example, which is addressed to Edinburgh.
[* Implies two names for the same vessel, but should read Frankland]     

There is one final question to be answered (handwriting suggests resemblance to that of another cover (illustrated by Foster, p.8) sent to London in 1708 by Chief Justice Peter Heywood in Jamaica.

It is thus probable that my cover originated in Jamaica rather than the other islands which Dummer's packets served in the West Indies. (viz. Barbados, Antigua, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis).  It would be an even more important cover if it had originated from one of the smaller islands.

Very few letters were actually carried by the service; only about 1000 - 1500 letters are thought to have been carried by each of the monthly packet ships.  (The number was significantly reduced with the doubling of the postal rates in early 1705).

Secondly, of the 22 ships that were employed by Dummer between 1705 and 1711, 2 were wrecked, and a further 10 were captured by the enemy as a result of the attendant upon the War if the Spanish Succession.  In all, only 53 round voyages were made by the whole Dummer Packet service.
