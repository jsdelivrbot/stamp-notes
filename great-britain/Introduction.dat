## Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Great Britain

It is an almost impossible task to describe the breadth of the Great Britain philatelic field in a meaningful, interesting and useful way. We have
attempted to provide a summary of its whole history rather than over focus on
specific areas. The vastness of the subject spanning over 700 years is difficult to organize in a manner that the postal historian can find easy to follow. This introduction summarizes the Great Britain posts and provides links to other articles.

The postal history of Great Britain parallels its history as a Colonial power and encompasses a number of past and recent conflicts. Besides  the historical perspective another aspect is the technological progress from simple delivery systems to the introduction of the world's first postage stamp in 1840 and the associated technologies that were necessary for printing, perforating and cancelling these stamps. The two early stamp printing firms that of Perkins Bacon and that of De La Rue, set the standards in security printing both for stamps as well as banknotes. We are fortunate that a large part of their archives survived and one can trace the history of most issues via the archives. Another aspect of technology was the evolution of shipping and routes, especially steam powered vessels in the second half of the ninenteeth century and its effect on costs and the speed of communications.

Lastly the pure philately study of its early stamps and even the more modern errors of the Elizabethan era provides for all interests. We have extensive sections on these modern errors and good collections can be assembled quickly and with reasonable means. 

From my own perspective as a Cape of Good Hope specialist expanding my knowledge to that of Great Britain and its Colonies provided a welcome background in understanding the development of the posts in the Cape of Good Hope. From a philatelic point of view an understanding of the triangulars and their intricate colour schemes only came after studying similar printings of stamps in Great Britain.

###Early history

The story begins in the 12th century with Henry I, who appointed messengers to carry letters for the government. It is estimated that between 1100 and 1135, 4,500 letters were carried by these messengers.[1] At this time, private individuals had to make their own arrangements. Henry III provided uniforms for the messengers, and Edward I instituted posting houses where the messengers could change horses. The reign of Edward II saw the first postal marking; handwritten notations saying "Haste, post haste".

Henry VIII created the Royal Mail in 1516, appointing Brian Tuke as "Master of the Postes", while Elizabeth I appointed Thomas Randolph as "Chief Postmaster". Under Thomas Witherings, chief postmaster under Charles I, the Royal Mail was made available to the public (1635),[1] with a regular system of post roads, houses, and staff.

From this time through to the postal reforms of 1839 - 1840 it was most common for the recipient to pay the postage, although it was possible to prepay the charge at the time of sending.

In 1661, Charles II made Henry Bishop the first Postmaster General (PMG).[1] In answer to customer complaints about delayed letters, Bishop introduced the Bishop mark, a small circle with month and day inside, applied at London, in the General Post office and the Foreign section, and soon after adopted in Scotland, (Edinburgh), and Ireland, (Dublin). In subsequent years, the postal system expanded from six roads to a network covering the country, and post offices were set up in both large and small towns, each of which had its own postmark.


In 1680 William Dockwra established the London Penny Post, a mail delivery system that delivered letters and parcels weighing up to one pound within the city of london and some of its immediate suburbs for the sum of one penny.[2]



Compared to the letters and documents they're ordinarily affixed to, the postage stamp is a relatively new invention. Even the Royal Mail, which was effectively established in 1516 when Henry VIII created the title of 'Master of the Posts,' predates the Penny Black by 324 years, whereas correspondence by letter is at least as old as the use of papyrus (or wood, or stone) in Ancient Egypt some five thousand years ago. Yet despite being late to the scene of world communication, the postage stamp, like all the best inventions throughout history, originated as an ingeniously simple and efficient solution to various problems that had long proved costly

Before its advent, deliveries were paid for by the recipient, meaning that if said recipient neither could nor wanted to pay the fee the letter was simply taken away and disposed of, and around the turn of the 19th Century this kind of an occurrence had become prevalent in rural areas which, falling outside the postal zone centred around London, were charged 3d for delivery rather than 2d. Due to the burgeoning nature of the postal system these kinds of discrepancies in service were commonplace, yet in 1834 the General Post Office refused calls for the 2 Penny Post to be extended outside of London and other urban centres

It was not until the publishing of Rowland Hill's influential pamphlet, Post Office Reform: its Importance and Practicability in 1837 that a viable alternative was proposed, and in 1839 the Postage Act was passed by parliament, authorising his plans for a universal, prepaid penny postage system and implementing them on the 6th May 1840 when Penny Black stamps and Twopenny Blue stamps were officially issued along with the Mulready, an envelope that had the postage rate pre-stamped on it. The Exchequer had arranged a competition in 1839 to design the former two, yet since none of the entries had been considered suitable the Treasury chose a design based on the 1834 sculpture of the then 15 year-old Princess Victoria by William Wyon, a design endorsed by Rowland Hill and eventually realised by the printing firm Perkins Bacon, who also printed 1 pound notes for English banks. The resulting Penny Black, despite having a print run that amounted to an impressive 286,700 sheets and 68,808,000 individual stamps, was undoubtedly an experimental product, and in 1841 it was replaced by Penny Red stamps, primarily because black, the least commonsensical choice of colour for stamps, had been found to make it difficult to spot cancellation marks.

Like the Penny Black stamps and Twopenny Blue stamps before it, the Penny Red stamps were of line-engraved manufacture, a process which involved the multistage engraving of recesses onto the reverse of a steel printing plate and then the use of this plate to print the stamps in sheets of 240 (20 rows of 12 stamps ( meaning that one sheet was worth exactly 1 pound). Despite a small and error prone run of embossed stamps trialled through 1847-54, this method of production proved dominant up until 1879, which was the year that saw Perkins Bacon lose its stamp printing contract to rival De La Rue. The latter firm used surface printing to produce its stamps, and with the earlier introduction of perforation in 1854 (to rectify the imprecision and inefficiency with which imperforated stamps were cut from their sheets using scissors) this change saw the neonatal postage stamp settle into a standardisation that would last it until 1971 and the arrival of a decimalised currency

Victorian era

The Victorian age saw an explosion of experimentation. The inefficiency of using scissors to cut stamps from the sheet inspired trials with rouletting (the Archer Roulette), and then with perforation, which became standard practice in 1854. In 1847, the (octagonal) 1 shilling (&pound;0.05) became the first of the British embossed postage stamps to be issued, followed by 10d stamps the following year, and 6d (&pound;0.025) values in 1854.


threepence surface-printed value from 1873
Surface-printed stamps first appeared in the form of a 4d stamp in 1855, printed by De La Rue, and subsequently became the standard type. 1/2 d (halfpenny) and 1 1/2d (penny halfpenny - pronounced pennyhaypny or threehaypence) engraved stamps issued in 1870 were the last engraved types of Queen Victoria; the next would not appear until 1913. Surface-printed stamps of the 1860s and 1870s all used the same profile of Victoria, but a variety of frames, watermarks, and corner lettering.
A 5 shilling (abbreviated as 5/- or as 5s.) (&pound;0.25) stamp first appeared in 1867, followed by 10 shilling (&pound;0.50) and &pound;1 values in 1878, culminating in a &pound;5 stamp in 1882.

THE UNIQUE EXAMPLE IN PRIVATE HANDS OF THE PERFORATED "PRINCE CONSORT" ESSAY IN BLUE

1850 Essay in finished form of the head of the Prince Consort in blue and perforated 16, large part original gum, very fine (SG Specialised DP71 3a).

The unique example in private hands, grossly undercatalogued and a superb addition to both line engraved and surface printed exhibition collections. There are only two other finished perforated examples in blue, one in the British Postal Museum & one in the Royal Collection Expertise: Certified BPA (2005)

Note: These essays were produced as evidence that Henry Archer could produce perforated and gummed stamps more cost effectively than Perkins Bacon, who were contracted with the Government to print stamps at the time.

"Penny Lilac" of 1881; 16 dots in each corner
Meanwhile, the age of the Penny Reds had come to an end along with the Perkins Bacon printing contract. The new low values were also surface-printed: first was a penny stamp coloured Venetian red in a square frame, issued in 1880. However, the passage of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881 necessitated new stamps valid also as revenue stamps, and so the Penny Lilac was issued in that year, inscribed "POSTAGE AND INLAND REVENUE". This stamp remained the standard letter stamp for the remainder of Victoria's reign, and vast quantities were printed. Later issues were inscribed POSTAGE & REVENUE which became the more familiar POSTAGE REVENUE.


21/2 old pence (twopenny halfpenny) value of the unpopular series of 1883/4
1883 and 1884 saw experimentation with stamps using fugitive inks with the 'Lilac and Green Issue'. These were rather plain designs, low values in lilac and high values in green, because those were the only colours available. They succeeded in their purpose - relatively few of the stamps survived usage, their colours fading away when soaked from the envelope - but they were not liked by the public.


The last major issue of Victoria was the "Jubilee issue" of 1887, a set of twelve designs ranging from 1/2 d. to 1s., most printed in two colours or on coloured paper. (Although issued during the Jubilee year, they were not issued specifically for the occasion, and are thus not commemoratives.)

Rurning to Britain however, there were several other changes of note between the contracting of De La Rue and the advent of decimalisation, the first of which being a direct consequence of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act of 1881. This stipulated that all new stamps must also double as revenue stamps, which on their own had in fact been in use for over a century prior to stamps, coming into existence after the 1694 Stamp Act had established a tax on legal documents. As a result the Penny Lilac was first issued on the 12th July 1881 bearing the inscription 'POSTAGE AND INLAND REVENUE,' and it remained the standard letter stamp for the rest of Victoria's reign.
 


 

Another significant development, and one which was greatly influential in taking the postage stamp from a largely utilitarian object into a cultural artefact able to excite appreciation and interest, was the issuing of the first commemorative stamps under the reign of George V. These stamps - a pair featuring a reduced profile of the King beside the proud figure of a lion - marked the holding of the British Empire Exhibition in Wembley during the years of 1924 and 1925. Other commemorative stamps soon followed, including a set marking the 9th Congress of the Universal Postal Union in 1929, an empire-wide omnibus issue celebrating the coronation of George VI in 1936 and of course a set in 1940 commemorating the centenary of the postage stamp itself.



By the time Queen Elizabeth II succeeded to the throne in 1952 the stamp was a familiar object, and it was only 15 years into her reign in 1967 when designers settled upon the definitive series which persists to this day. Initially the Wilding series of stamps had been the standard for the UK, a design featuring the Queen half turned towards the viewer. It was this aspect of the image in particular which was objected to in a letter written to the Post Office in 1961 by two influential stamp designers, Michael Goaman and Faith Jacques. They held that the design, by virtue of being in contradistinction to the practice of depicting each successive head of state in profile, represented the person of Elizabeth more than the monarchy itself, and they also argued that the portrait was difficult to include in commemorative stamps.

 

 

 Therefore in the summer of 1965 the Post Office and the Stamp Advisory Committee invited artists to submit designs, while the then Postmaster General Tony Benn suggested that the royal image should be replaced by the name of the country (either 1/2 or 1/2 Great Britain ), a suggestion which was shot down in part because of private opposition from the Queen herself.Of all the artists to have submitted work to the Post Office, it was the sculptor Arnold Machin who did most to impress the SAC, and on the 5th June 1967 it was his sculptor of the Queen (wearing a diadem crown made for George IV;s coronation in 1820) that adorned the newly issued Machin series, distinctive for its uncluttered design and palette of bold singles colours. These are the definitive stamps still in use today, and the refusal of the Queen to approve any changes on three separate occasions - in 1981, 1985 and 1990 - makes it very likely that they will not see any cosmetic changes until the succession of the next monarch.
