\chapter{Airgraphs}    

Long delays during the Second World War in receiving news from the Middle East was somehow relieved after a year and a half of war by a fast air-mail service that could be sent by military aircraft. The airgraph letter was devised to save on weight. Letters were photographed and then sent home by microfilm. In London the letters were printed and delivered by the Post Office as ordinary letters.

The airgraph was developed by Kodak when by 1930 they have developed the technology for photographing documents in miniature. 

The first airgraphs out of London were flown in April 1941. The volume of this mail was very large and is recorded that the John Dickinson & Co., of Tottenham had to modify their envelope machines, so as to produce the envelope, insert the airgraph and seal the envelope, all in one operation; one machine could handle 8,000 airgraphs per hour.

So successful was this service that over 8,000,000 flew this route before the end of 1941.

Extensions to the service were soon made and equipment were sent to various places in the Dominions and the colonies, where they could serve the Forces overseas. Mail was available at Johannesburg, Bombay, Calcutta, Melborne and Wellington; Before the end of the War the service was extended to Nairobi, Colombo, Naples and Toronto.

After the United States entered the War the same sort of mail was used for the American Expeditionary ; it was known as V-mail.

The airgraph service came to an end in the summer of 1945. By this time the service had handled 350,000,000 airgraphs. The peak was reached in 1943, when 1,500,000 left London in a week, The airgraphs weight was 50 tons instead of 4,500 for a similar volume of ordinary letters.
