\chapter{Surface Printed 1855-1883}

The surface printed postage stamps were a necessary evolution of stamp production.  The line-engraved method was not adequate to produce the volume of stamps required at the required pace and due to the high turn over of plates due to wear, was not economically practical.  The embossed issues turned out to be a failed experiment,  due to clumsy slow production,  they were also a poor medium for perforation.  

The surface printed technology,  provided by the printing firm of De La Rue,  was fast, relatively inexpensive,  and the plates held up better to wear. 

Also, examples of various stages of the process which lead to the final product will be presented, such as essay, proof,  and imprimatur.  However,  the surface printed stamps form a rather vast area of Queen Victoria Great Britain Philately, and therefore no attempt at complete comprehensive listing of minor types and varieties will be made.
