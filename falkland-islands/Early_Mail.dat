\chapter{Falkland Islands: Postal History and Stamps}

The earliest incoming letter addressed to the Falkland Islands appears to be from a whaling correspondence in 1831. There is another letter claiming that it was the earliest known cover and the reason for one to be careful not to state the
same.

\ph[90%]{../falkland-islands/earliest-incoming-letter.jpg}{
1831 whaling letter from New London, Connecticut, addressed to "Capt Lyman Allyn, Ship Jno & Edward, Falkland Islands". On the reverse are written instructions that read: "Should the Capt. of Ship Franklin fall in with the ships Julius Caesar, Flora or Comm. Perry before he see the Jno T Edwards, he is requested to deliver this to their captains who has the permission of the writers to open same". Very interesting contents which discusses the capture of sealmen by the pirate Disnet. He also discusses whaling and the hopes that US naval ships in Brazil will protect whalers. Also a detailed list of where whales are found from the Red Sea to the Antarctic. A remarkable letter, and believed THE EARLIEST RECORDED INGOING POSTAL ITEM TO THE FALKLAND ISLANDS.
