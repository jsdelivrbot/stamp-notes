##Falkland Islands: Postal History and Stamps

It is strange that Fox bay should have a special obliterating stamp, as Port Stanley stopped using such stamps almost entirely about 1895. James Andrews mentions this obliterator (denoted as Type 3a) only in passing and then only in the Appendix. At the time of the publication of his book, \textit{The Cancellations of the Falkland Islands and the Dependencies} apparently there none recorded.

A postcard with a unique postmark is shown in \ref{WFI}.
