\chapter{1928 Provisional} 

The need for this provisional issue was caused by the arrival at South Georgia of the whaling fleet and the R.R.S. "William Scoresby" early in 1928, creating a shortage of the 1/2p and 2 1/2p adhesives.

"William Scoresby" early in 1928, creating a shortage of the 1/2p and 2 1/2p adhesives. A "2 1/2D" surcharge issue was authorized and a brass die of the surcharge was made at Messrs. Salvesen's whaling station at Leith Harbour. Surcharging was undertaken at the Grytviken Post Office, as requested, between February 7 and 22. This unique proof was originally owned by the Sub-magistrate of South Georgia, Mr. A.G. Nelson Jones, who sent it with a letter dated March 24, 1932 (which accompanies this lot) to Dudley Stone, into whose collection it passed. In Mr. Jones' letter he recounts the events at Leith Harbour and comments "This copy would be the first to be surcharged and is undoubtedly the only one in existence with an indelible surcharge."One of the key rarities of Falkland Islands philately.

fulled the British Philatelic Association which issued a certificate in 1942.
