##The Tabarin Operation 1943-1945 

During World War II, Operation Tabarin was a small British military expedition 
launched from the UK in 1943 to the Antarctic to establish permanently-occupied bases.

##Reasons for the expedition

There were several reasons for Tabarin. Prior to the start of the war, German aircraft had dropped markers with swastikas across Queen Maud Land in an attempt to create a territorial claim. 
In 1943, British personnel from HMS Carnarvon Castle removed Argentine flags from Deception Island. There were also concerns within the Foreign Office about the direction of United States' post-war activity in the region. So, one reason was to establish solid British claims to various uninhabited islands and parts of Antarctica, reinforced by Argentine sympathies toward Germany.

Secondly, there was a need to deny opportunities to the enemy. Germany was known to use remote islands as rendezvous points and as shelters for raiders, U-boats and supply ships. Also, in 1941, there had been a fear that Japan might attempt to seize the Falkland Islands, either as a base or hand them to Argentina, thus gaining political advantage for the Axis and denying their use to Britain. Deception Island, in the British South Shetland Islands, possessed a sheltered anchorage with an old Norwegian whaling station. In 1941, the British (aboard HMS Queen of Bermuda) had taken the precaution of destroying coal dumps and oil tanks there, to prevent their possible use by the Germans.

It has also been suggested that the operation may have partially been a disinformation exercise, nominally to detect suspected German naval replenishment activity - information which was, in fact, being obtained from the cracking of the Enigma machine. Whether or not this was the case may be revealed when the remaining government files are released.

##The expedition

Led by Lieutenant James Marr, the fourteen strong team left the 
Falkland Islands in two ships, HMS William Scoresby (a minesweeping trawler) and Fitzroy, 
on Saturday January 29, 1944. Marr had accompanied the British explorer Ernest Shackleton on his Antarctic expeditions on the 1920s.

Bases were established during February near the abandoned Norwegian whaling station on 
Deception Island (February 3), where the Union Flag was hoisted in place of Argentine flags, 
and at Port Lockroy (February 11) on the coast of Graham Land. A further base was founded at Hope Bay 
on February 13, 1945, after a failed attempt to unload stores on February 7, 1944.

British territorial claims were further enhanced by the issue of postage stamps.

##Reaction

The decision to launch Tabarin was not, apparently, a political decision. Winston Churchill was out of the country and a memo from him, following news of the bases in the press, also indicates that he was apparently unaware of the decision. In it, he expresses concern that the move may harm relations with the United States during the preparations for Operation Overlord (the invasion of Normandy). A reply from the Foreign Office indicated that the operation was launched not because the USA had failed to recognise British claims to the territory, but to reassert British territorial claims against Argentine and Chilean incursion.

##Post-war developments

Following the end of the War, in 1945 Operation Tabarin bases were handed over to the civilians of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS), subsequently renamed the British Antarctic Survey (BAS).

The ownership of the {{wi:South Shetland Islands}} has yet to be decided. 
British claims, and Argentine and Chilean claims, to the islands have been put to one side 
to allow scientific research to continue. 
The United States and Russia have reserved their right to make territorial claims.

On February 3, 1944 the British established a permanent base on Deception Island as part of Operation Tabarin, and occupied it until December 5, 1967, when a volcanic eruption forced a temporary withdrawal. It was used again between December 4, 1968 and February 23, 1969, 
when further volcanic activity caused it to be abandoned.
