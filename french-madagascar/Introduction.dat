\section{Madagascar}

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Madagascar,  also known as Malagasy.
Madagascar is an island nation in the Indian Ocean off the southeastern coast of Africa. The main island, also called Madagascar, is the fourth-largest island in the world. See also [Diego Suarez](../diego-suarez/introduction "Diego Suarez stamps and postal history.").


\section{First stamps}

The first stamps used in Madagascar were general issues for the French Colonies.[1]

\subsection{British posts}

British interests in Madagascar organised two different posts on the island.
A runner service between Tananarive and the French Post Office at Tamatave was organised by British residents before 1884. It was made official by the British Vice Consul in 1884. It used locally produced stamps between 1884 and 1897 after which stamps were discontinued but the service continued with handstruck marks.[1]
During the French war of occupation the British ran an inland postal service using special stamps between January and September 1895.[1] This was not an official service of the British Post Office.


\subsection{Independence}



The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an autonomous state within the French Community. The first stamps of the republic were issued in December 1958.[1]

POSTAL HISTORY OF
MADAGASCAR.
When Madagascar was occunied recently
by the British to foil a passible Axis
seizure, philatelic attention was turned
to the huge, short-lived consular stamps
issued" during the brief earlier period of
i British rule on the fourth, largest island
in the world.

Madagascar's postal history is divided
into three periods. The first service was
established by the Norwegian Missionary
Society, which engaged runners to trans
I port such mail as arrived at or was
dispatched from Madagascar. The second
period was initiated by W. Clayton
Pickersgill, a missionary who, because ol
his influence with Queen Ranavalona HI
was appointed as British vice-consul at
Antananarivo. The third period com-
menced in the 1880's. when Great Britain
relinquished all claims to Madagascar m
favour cf France, in return for which
Great Britain received jurisdiction over
Zanzibar.,
i Before General Joseph -Simon Gallieni
deposed Queen Ranavalona III. and f orm
I ally annexed Madagascar thc island had
no official post office, but only such local
services as were inaugurated t>y the mis-
sionary societies and the .British and
French offices for the convenience oi
their individual following.

The missionary societies' service satis-
fied their needs for transporting mail
from interior cities to sea coast towns,
but because it was a purely local venture
it is recognised only by advanced
postal history students.

Mr. Pickersgill, on the other hand, was
much concerned with postal service. As
organised before he took matters into
consideration, mail service between the
i island and Great Britain was haphazard.
Letters posted in England for Madagascar
were charged lOd. a half ounce. Of
! that sum fourpence was the cost for
transmission to Mauritius, the nearest
British possession, and the remainder for
shipping from there to Madagascar,
about 400 miles.
Even that sum might have been toler-
ated if there had been service on a
regular basis. Conditions were described
by Mr. Pickersgill as follows:
"There is no mail service, no sub-
sidised line of steamers, no regular
dispatch by sailing vessels, no contract
with anybody to carry letters and no re-
presentative of the post office to receive
and distribute them. It is true that the
Mauritius post office takes Madagascar
letters in. and that they are kept there
until opportunity of forwarding them oc-
curs-until a vessel proceeding to Mada-
gascar can be found whose captain will
not decline to carry them."
Mr. Pickersgill, on his own initiative,
accordingly established a regular insular
service and in 1884 prepared the first
scarce consular stamps. These stamps were
typopraphed at Antananarivo, the capital
of Madagascar, in sheets of eight each.
They were stamped later with the official
consular hand die. in black or violet.
These staines, which are listed in the
"Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue."
are not really adhesives. Only one corner
of each was gummed, and according to
records they were affixed to letters by
this one corner. When the letters by
which they franked arrived at Tamatave,
the main seaport, they were removed
which indicates tost they were actually
vouchers to shew that local postage fees
had been paid.
Most letters from the island to Europe
subsequently were carried by French
packets and had to be franked with
French adhesives.
The French had established a post office
in Tamatave which was recognised by the
Universal Postal Union in 1882. but it
was not until 1889 that distinctive stamps
were issued by the French. These con-
sisted only of general colonial adhesives
with provisional overprints. The first
regular stamps with ? the inscription
"Postes Madagascar" were issued in 189L
From then on, Madagascar had many
issues', and while most of them are rather
common in unused condition, specimens
on original envelopes are philatelic treas-
ures since comparatively little mail was
sent from this remote island.
Twentieth-century issues reflect the
nature of Madagascar. The 1903 series
depicts a zebu, a traveller's tree and a
lemur.. The zebu represents the promin-
ence of cattle on this island for although
there are but 3.500.000 inhabitants there
are 5.000.000 head of cattle The tree like-
wise is characteristic; knownÂ» as the rav
enala it may be punctured with a sharp
stick and as much as a pint of fresh
water will flow from the wound which
wfil heal so quickly that more water will
be on tap the following day. It has saved
the lives of many who otherwise might
have perished ir. the heat.
The lemur is so characteristic of Mada-
gascar that it has been called the-island's
trade mark. In the time of Marco Polo
Madagascar was reported to have 'huge
beasts and birds so large that they, could
carry elephants; but to-day the onlyFix this text
animals there are the leruur and crocodiles.
