Holmes<sup>1</sup> reported that the Royal Collection at Buckingham Palace includes a 
notable strip of this provisional. I is an unused marginal strip of six, and on the margin it is written: "Purchased from the Post Office Kimberley Griqualand West September 1874 O. H. Bate". The block was formerly in the collections of M. P. Castle, and later in Sir Harold Reckitt's collection before being acquired by King George V. Used examples of this provisional are rarer than used. The strip was shown at the Royal Philatelic Society in and is illustrated below:
