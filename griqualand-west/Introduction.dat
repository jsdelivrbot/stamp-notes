\chapter{Griqualand West}

The philately of Griqualand can roughly be divided into four periods: The early missionary letters, the use of Cape adhesives, the use of Griqualand West overprints on Cape stamps, and lastly the use of Griqualand West stamps in the Cape, after the annexation of Griqualand West and its incorporation in the Cape Colony. 

The overprinted series are of interest in themeselves as even today, no clear picture has emerged as to the plating of the issues. The postal marks and routes are fairly well researched, but very little material has surived to enable detail studies.


1874 (Sept) Cape Surcharged in manuscript in red ink __1d__ and __FOUR PENCE_ struck out by a horizontal stroke. This was a provisional issue made in Kimberley when the stock of Cape 1d. had been temporarily exhausted.

Holmes<sup>1</sup> reported that the Royal Collection at Buckingham Palace includes a 
notable strip of this provisional. I is an unused marginal strip of six, and on the margin it is written: "Purchased from the Post Office Kimberley Griqualand West September 1874 O. H. Bate". The block was formerly in the collections of M. P. Castle, and later in Sir Harold reckitt's collection before being acquired by King George V. Used examples of this provisional are rarer than used.
