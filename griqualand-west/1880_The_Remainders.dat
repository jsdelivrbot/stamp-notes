\chapter{1880 The Remainders} 

Griqualand West ceased to be a separate Colony, becoming a province within the Cape Colony in October 1880. The overprinted stamps were withdrawn and ordinary Cape stamps
took their place. The stocks of overprinted stamps were returned to Cape Town, on July 19th, 1881, the quantities of the different values being as follows:

\begin{stripedtable}
\TR5 \halfd &127,000 & & &
\TR5 1d.    &303,603 & & &
\TR5 4d     &196,560 & & &
\TR5 6d.    &79,200  & & &
\TR5 1/-    &124,320 & & &
\TR5 5/-    &7,590   & & &
\end{stripedtable}

The quantities comprised stamps of all the issues, the bulk, however, were the small overprints of 1879.

The remainders were not destroyed, but distributed to various offices in the Cape Colony and used as normal Cape stamps. No records exist of the distribution, but based on the evidence of postmarks they have been noted in the following offices:

\begin{stripedtable}
\TR5 Cape Town & King William's Town &&&
\TR5 Bland's Drift & Mossel Bay &&&
\TR5 East London & Port Elizabeth &&&
\TR5 Graaf-Reinet & Queenstown&&&
\TR5 Grahamstown  &Somerset East&&&
\end{stripedtable}
