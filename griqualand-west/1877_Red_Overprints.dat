\chapter{1877 The 'G' Red Overprints}    

During April 1877 five values of the current Cape of Good Hope stamps were  overprinted in red and one (the 1d) overprinted in black with a large capital 'G'. These stamps are referred to as the red overprints, despite the exceptional use of black ink for the 1d. value. Of course it did not make much sense to have the 1d. overprinted in red, as it would be very difficult to distinguish it from the background of the carmine-red colour of the postage stamp. Six values of the Cape stamps were overprinted as follows:

\begin{stripedtable}
\TR5 &\halfd. grey-black &6d. violet & & &
\TR5 &1d. carmine-red &1s. green & & &
\TR5 &4d. blue (with outer frame line) &5s. orange-yellow & & &
\TR5 &4d. blue (without outer frame line) & & & &
\end{stripedtable}

All stamps are perforated 14 and watermarked Crown over CC.

The issue has been plated by Holmes, based on extending studies by...

The overprinting was done very carefully, though one half-sheet of 120 of the 1/- vaue received the overprint inverted. Only Type 1 is catalogued by Stanley Gibbons, but several of the other types also exist. Of these the Royal Collection has types 1a, 2a, and 4, while the Tapling Collection includes Types 1a, 2a, 4 and 6. It seems likely that most of the half-sheet was returned to Cape Town with the remainders in 1880, as a majority of the known inverts have Cape Colony cancellations.

Double overprints exist on the 6d., 1/-, and 5/-, but they are more in the nature of
'jumps' rather than the result of two distinct impresions, and are not of any real importance.
