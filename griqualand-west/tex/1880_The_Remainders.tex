\chapter{1880 The Remainders} 

Griqualand West ceased to be a separate Colony, becoming a province within the Cape Colony in October 1880. The overprinted stamps were withdrawn and ordinary Cape stamps
took their place. The stocks of overprinted stamps were returned to Cape Town, on July 19th, 1881, the quantities of the different values being as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule$\frac{1}{2}$d.  &127,000 \\
 1d.    &303,603 \\
 4d     &196,560 \\
 6d.    &79,200  \\
 1/-    &124,320 \\
 5/-    &7,590  
\end{tabular}

The quantities comprised stamps of all the issues, the bulk, however, were the small overprints of 1879.

The remainders were not destroyed, but distributed to various offices in the Cape Colony and used as normal Cape stamps. No records exist of the distribution, but based on the evidence of postmarks they have been noted in the following offices:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
 Cape Town & King William's Town\\
 Bland's Drift & Mossel Bay\\
 East London & Port Elizabeth\\
 Graaf-Reinet & Queenstown\\
 Grahamstown  &Somerset East
\end{tabular}

A consignment of Cape stamps sold to the Transvaal by the Cape P.O. during the first months of 1877 included 1d., 4d. and 6d. values overprinted "G" for use in Griqualand West. These were used in the normal way to make up ZAR/Cape combination frankings on mail addressed overseas and forwarded via Kimberley and Cape Town The letter evidently weighed more than half an ounce, and is franked at the double rate. From the transit dates it was carried aboard the Union liner "Danube" which sailed on 19th. June and offloaded the mails on 12th. July. H. Rider Haggard, who hoisted the flag at Pretoria when the annexation of the Republic was proclaimed, was then the Special Commissioner´s secretary/companion, but in August 1877, Sir Theophilus Shepstone appointed him Master and Registrar of the High Court. His African experiences were later incorporated in his famous novels "King Solomon´s Mines", "She", etc.
