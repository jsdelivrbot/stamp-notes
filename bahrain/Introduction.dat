\chapter{Bahrain}


The first post office in Bahrain opened on 1 August 1884 in the capital Manama. This was a sub-office of the Indian Post Office at Bushire in Iran, both of which were part of the Bombay Postal Circle. This remained the only post office until 1946. Until 1933 un-overprinted stamps of British India were used in Bahrain and used examples may be identified from the cancels used which are illustrated in specialised catalogues.[1]

In 1911 the Sheikh of Bahrain signed an agreement not to allow any other nation other than Great Britain to establish any Post Office in the island, and in 1914 he gave an undertaking not to allow any prospecting for, or exploitation of oil without the consent of the British Government.


\subsection{1933 to 1947}

British India stamps overprinted BAHRAIN were used from 1933 to 1947 depicting George V (1933) and then George VI from 1938.[2] Un-overprinted Victory stamps of India were also on sale in Bahrain during January 1946 and a 16 anna stamp booklet was issued in 1934.[1]

\subsection{Overprinted British stamps}

From 1948 to 1960 Bahrain used the stamps of Great Britain depicting George VI then Queen Elizabeth II all overprinted BAHRAIN and the applicable value.[2] Numerous varieties of overprint exist which are listed in specialist catalogues and eagerly sought after by philatelists.[1]

\section{First Bahraini stamps}

The first stamps specifically designed for Bahrain were a definitive set issued in 1960. These featured Shaikh Sulman bin Hamed al-Khalifa with Arabic text at the top. In 1964 a new definitive set was issued depicting Shaikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa and the Bahrain Post Office fully took over from Britain on 1 January 1966 when a further definitive set was issued.[2]

A number of local stamps were also issued between 1953 and 1961 which, whilst intended only for domestic mail, are known used on international mail. These stamps all depicted Shaikh Sulmanbin Hamed al-Khalifa and are similar in design to the 1960 series.[1]

\section{War Tax issues}

Beginning during the Arab-Israeli War of October 1973, Bahrain required that all letters bear evidence of the payment of a 5 fils tax that raised funds for Palestinian refugees.[3] At first regular 5 fils stamps were added at the post office and handstamped 'War Effort' in Arabic. On 21 October 1973, similarly inscribed stamps, printed with light blue ink, were issued.[4] On 1 December 1973,[5] this first issue was replaced by one with a more stylized script, also in light blue.[6] In 1988, this second stamp was issued with slightly larger perforations.[2][4] While more appropriately known as postal tax stamps, major catalogues have classified them as war tax stamps.[2][4]

\section{Recent stamp issues}

Since obtaining postal independence, the Bahrain Post Office has pursued a conservative policy issuing four or five sets of stamps each year with an occasional new definitive series. The stamps have generally featured subjects of local or regional interest.

\section{Cinderella stamps}

A number of cinderella and bogus stamps have been issued over the years including official traffic safety labels available free from Bahraini post offices in 1981 and a bogus Bahrain Camel Post series between 1986 and 1990. The Camel Post series was based on the famous desert postman stamps of Sudan and sold in aid of a home for disabled children.[7]
