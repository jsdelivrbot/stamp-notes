##Bechuanaland - Stamps and Postal History

###1912 Downey Heads
Designed by the artists Bertram Mackennel and G. W. Eve, these issues were the first for King George V. The head was copied from a photograph taken by W. & D. Downey from who the name of the issue is taken.

The first two values, the \halfd and 1d, were released on the 22nd June 1911 so as to coincide with the King's coronation. However the designs immediately met with a storm of criticism. Until this point in time, all GB issues had used a side-on profile of the King or Queen whereas the Downey issues used a three quarter profile. It was also felt that attempting to derive a typographed image from a photograph had not proved a success.

Although further values up to 1s were being prepared, the Downey issue was replaced in 1912 by new designs which saw a return to the "normal" profile head. Indeed, since the Downey issues, all GB stamps have used a profile head.

In Bechuanaland only the 1 penny scarlet was used. The stamp can be found with the variety no cross on crown. Specimens exist overprinted
'CANCELLED'.

The __Downey Head__ stamps were used only in only two other countries besides Bechuanaland - Morocco Agencies and the Levant, probably
due to the short life of the stamps.

With the Downey issue being very short-lived in 1913 Stamps of King George of Great Britain with the King George portrait rotated
as for other issues were overprinted for use in Bechuanaland. they can be found in large blocks and control numbers where
one can attempt to re-construct all the printings.

Control blocks can be found 'perforated through margin' or 'imperforate through margin'. See both example at left here.
In all cases where the lower margin is imperforate, one extension hole is present.
