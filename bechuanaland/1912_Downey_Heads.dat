\section{1912 Downey Heads}

Designed by the artists Bertram Mackennel and G. W. Eve, these issues were the first for King George V. The head was copied from a photograph taken by W. & D. Downey from who the name of the issue is taken.

The first two values, the \halfd and 1d, were released on the 22nd June 1911 so as to coincide with the King's coronation. However the designs immediately met with a storm of criticism. Until this point in time, all GB issues had used a side-on profile of the King or Queen whereas the Downey issues used a three quarter profile. It was also felt that attempting to derive a typographed image from a photograph had not proved a success.

Although further values up to 1s were being prepared, the Downey issue was replaced in 1912 by new designs which saw a return to the "normal" profile head. Indeed, since the Downey issues, all GB stamps have used a profile head.

In Bechuanaland only the 1 penny scarlet was used. The stamp can be found with the variety no cross on crown. Specimens exist overprinted
\textsc{CANCELLED}.

The Downey Head stamps were used only in only two other countries besides Bechuanaland - Morocco Agencies and the Levant, probably due to the short life of the stamps.
