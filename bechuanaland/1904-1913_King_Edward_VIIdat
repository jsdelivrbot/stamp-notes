This stamp -breaking the pattern of using either Cape or British stamps used a Transvaal stamp. The purpose of the stamp
was for fiscal use, but a certain number were allowed to be used postally probably by favour for collectors.

It can be found on covers (woth from 2N) and in blocks from 6N.

Current catalogue values are very low in my opinion, given that the runs were very small, but demonstrate the aversion of
many collectors with anything 'Transvaal', given the difficulty in identifying forgeries and reprints.
