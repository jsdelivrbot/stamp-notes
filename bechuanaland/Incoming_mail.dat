\ph[80%]{../bechuanaland/13027_312_1.jpg}{312  1897 (27 Feb.) Cape 1/2d. green card, 
uprated with 1d. carmine, from R. Urry, the manager of the Standard
Bank at Mafeking, who later signed the Mafeking siege banknotes, to 
"R J Hicks Esq./lake N'gami"; the card
with a corner crease/crack though one of the few items of mail addressed to a 
member of the British West
Charterland Expedition, and the only one to Mr. Hicks, one of the original 
concessionaries. A very scarce
incoming card to this little-known expedition and over a year earlier than any 
previously recorded. Photo \pound200-250
