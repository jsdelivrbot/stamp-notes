##Bechuanaland - Stamps and Postal History

On October 1884 Sir Charles Warren
was sent out from England to Bechuanaland in command of an expeditionary force.
The southern part of the country, was occupied in 1884 and declared a British possession on September 30th 1885.

A consignment of the unappropriated die types printed __Military Telegraphs__ was forwared at the end of November to Captain
Jelf, R.E., commanding the telegraph Corps and were received by him on board H.M.S. Pembroke Castle. What quantities and values were supplied
is not known, but they are the first adhesive stamps of Bechuanaland. 

When Sir Charles Warren marched into Vryburg on February 7th 1885, the postal system was taken over by the military and the Cape 6d. and 1/- postage stamps
overprinted __Military Telegraphs__. These stamps have only been found on telegraph envelopes and telegrams.

In November 1895 it was itself annexed to the Crown Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, and ceased to have an independent existence; its Revenue
stamps were replaced by those of the Cape.

##Army telegraph Stamps

[Sam Lawrence FRPSL](http://www.gbps.org.uk/gbj_archive/gbj-39-4.pdf)

I have been rather puzzled for some time as to why the
British Army should require special stamps (Figs 1
& 3) printed for themselves, where other Government
departments such as Board of Trade, Government
Parcels, etc., made do quite comfortably with the postage
stamps of Queen Victoria overprinted for their respective
usages (although they did overprint the \halfd value  see
Fig. 2). One could probably make a case out for the War
Office requiring the use of telegrams for inland
communications, where time was not of such importance
as it was to the Army in the field, but there again, in the
heat of battle, the question arises, why use stamps when
speed was vital? And it is ludicrous to suppose that the
army in action kept tally of telgrams sent and paid for
them!

The reason why the authorities had the printers prepare and print special stamps for Army
use only lies in the annals of the Royal Corps of Signals. It all started, as so many military
innovations, in the field. Prior to the development of the telegraph system, a number of
means of communications was used. During the early part of the 19th century when the
British Army was spearheading the advance and conquest of the British Empire, notably in
Africa, runners were used, as was semaphore and heliograph; in fact anything to speed up
information was used to send and receive.
The invention and development of the telegraph changed all that for ever. When the
Government nationalised all the small telegraph companies in the UK in 1870, the GPO
found themselves extremely short of engineers to run the system. Arrangements were
made with theWar Office to recruit young men of 16-plus for training. These young men
and other experienced engineers from the Royal Engineers, were formed into army units.
This had two major effects: TheGPOwas able to use these men when the army was not in
action abroad; and the army had a ready-made reserve of telegraph operaters as and when
required for their expeditions and skirmishes as they were then called. The initiative was
taken by a Col. Gossett of the Royal Engineers and so a number of special army units were
formed.

At first, a telegraph detachment was formed into a platoon
troop. This first troop consisted of two officers and 133 other
ranks. The unit had 12 four-wheeled wagons, each loaded with
three miles of 3-strand heavy cables rolled on half-mile drums,
with the necessary iron poles to carry the wires. There were also
four office wagons fitted with instruments and eight spare
wagons. All the drivers of these vehicles were trained in the use
of this equipment.

In the following year, 1871, the establishment was brought up to
the strength of five officers, 245 other ranks and 15 horses. For
the next 13 years this group provided detachments, as and when
the British Army was involved in their skirmishes and
expeditions.


In 1884, all these odd units were amalgamated in the Telegraph Battalion; and that was the
position until the outbreak of the FirstWorldWar. The units and later this Battalion saw
service in the ASHANTI CAMPAIGN of 1873-74, in BECHUANALAND in 1884-85
and also in the same years in the NILE and SUAKIN EXPEDITIONS. The history of the
British Army during the BOER WARS has been too well documented to mention here,
but the Telegraph Battalion certainly played its part in those campaigns.

In all the campaigns, representatives of the press were present and they were able, via the
Army Telegraph link, to send details of the campaigns swiftly to their newspapers. The
officers and other ranks were also allowed to use the Army sytem to keep in touch with
their folks back home. These telegrams had to be paid for: whilst the Army kept in
constant touch with theWar Office by telegram for which no charge was made, anything
other than military matters that were sent required records kept and payment made.

There was, however, an exception made in the use of
stamps produced and printed for the British Army: two
Cape of Good Hope values (Fig. 4) overprinted
"Military Telegraphs" were brought into use by Sir
Charles Warren when he entered Vryburg in
Bechuanaland on 7 February 1885 and were never used
for civilian purposes.

During the second ASHANTI war of 1896 the Army sent a total of 13,992 telegrams, an
everage of 300 per day, but unfortunately there are no records of how many were "private"
telegrams.

It can now be seen why some of the high values of these stamps were needed, up to the \pound5
value, as the press corps, filing copy of the various battles, must have send telegrams of
astonishing lengths.

Many philatelists shy away from collecting Army telegraphs as they consider them as
"Cinderellas", however, in many instances they served just as good a purpose as any other means of
communication employed by the GPO and can be classed as postage stamps.
