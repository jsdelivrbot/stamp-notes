##Bechuanaland - Stamps and Postal History


A comprehensive study of the stamps was puublished in the London Philatelist by Brian Hurst. In 2007 Hurst came across cahnce discovery of an accounts  record in the Cape National Archives with details of all the stamps issued to the newly formed Colony. The account book entitled
\textit{Bechuanaland Crown Colony - Office of the Receiver and Accountant General - Register Stamp Accounts} – 1885/1889  provided new information regarding the early issues.
It is effectively an accounts book; but rather than dealing with income and expenditure it records
the receipt and issue, by dates and quantities, of all postage and revenue stamps for the period. It
gives an exact record of printing quantities, dates of receipt and dates of issue for each individual
denomination and its analysis provides a major step forward in improving the knowledge of the
stamps of the period. These figures were published in this article for the first time and provide an answer to much of the speculation that has occurred over the last few decades.

\section{The Initial Supply}

The Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland was proclaimed on 30 September 1885 following the
successful expedition led by Major-General Sir Charles Warren to annex the Boer Republics of Stellaland and Goshen. A rudimentary postal service was already in existence at Vryburg, the chief town of Stellaland, and this, together with its stock of postage stamps, was taken over by the new British authority. Good communication was an essential element of British colonial government, and having already established a comprehensive telegraph system during the military campaign, it was considered essential to expand the postal services. An order was therefore placed with the Postmaster-General of Cape Colony to provide quantities of suitably overprinted stamps of all denominations currently used in Cape Colony, with the exception of the five shilling value.

Consequently, instructions were given to Messrs W.A. Richards & Son of Cape Town, official printers to the Government of Cape Colony, asking them to overprint current stamps of the Cape of Good Hope with the words ‘British Bechuanaland’.

The overprint was applied to complete undivided sheets of 240 stamps comprising four panes
of 60 stamps each, separated by gutters in the form of a cross, and the initial consignment, which comprised the five values illustrated (Fig. 1), arrived at the office of the Accountant-General in Mafeking on 30 November 1885.

The quantity of stamps received from Cape Town for each value was as follows:

\begin{tabular}{lll}
½d grey-black, overprint in red &Crown CA watermark &100 sheets\\
1d rose-red, overprint in black &Cabled Anchor watermark &200 sheets\\
2d pale bistre, overprint in black &Cabled Anchor watermark &250 sheets\\
3d pale claret, overprint in black &Crown CA watermark &50 sheets\\
6d reddish purple, overprint in black &Cabled Anchor watermark &100 sheets\\
\end{tabular}

For the first few months of its existence, the new colonial administration of British Bechuanaland was based at Mafeking, with the Governor of Cape Colony and High Commissioner for South
Africa, Sir Hercules Robinson, serving as the ultimate authority for British Bechuanaland through
his appointed local administrator, Sir Sidney Shippard, a former Cape Colony judge. The postal
administration for the colony was however, for practical reasons, based at Vryburg. The official
responsible for distribution of the 1885 postage stamps from Vryburg is described in the Stamp
Accounts Register as “C.C. Vryburg”, which I have interpreted as “Civil Commissioner, Vryburg”.
This would be Mr. A. Faure Robertson, who is recorded as being Civil Commissioner, Postmaster-
General and Resident Magistrate at Vryburg at the time. The colony had a very small population in
its early days, and many officials were expected to undertake duties in more than one capacity.
On 2 December 1885, the Civil Commissioner at Vryburg recorded the receipt of the following
quantities of stamps from the Accountant-General in Mafeking:

\begin{verbatim}
½d 25 sheets 3d 20 sheets
1d 50 sheets 6d 25 sheets
2d 100 sheets
\end{verbatim}

On the same day, the Civil Commissioner, in his capacity as distributor of stamps, sent the following
quantities to the Resident Magistrate at Taung, who had been appointed to act as postmaster:

\begin{verbatim}
½d 2 sheets 3d 1 sheet
1d 5 sheets 6d 1 sheet
2d 5 sheets
\end{verbatim}


I think it highly unlikely that the supplies arrived in time for them to be put on sale at Taung,
roughly nine hours distance from Vryburg, on the 2nd, and consider the following day, 3rd December
1885, to be the most likely first day of issue to the public. This is supported by the fact that the
postmaster at Vryburg, the site of the principal post office, was not issued with his stamps until 3rd
December. The quantities he received were:

\begin{tabular}{ll}

1/2 d 1/2 sheet & 3d 1 sheet \\
1d 1 sheet & 6d 2 sheets \\
2d 5 sheets & 0 \\
\end{tabular}

No doubt these quantities were considered adequate in view of the speed with which the supply
chain could replenish stocks at the Vryburg post office. This is supported by an entry in the records
showing that the Vryburg postmaster needed a further sheet of 2d stamps only nine days later,
whereas Taung received no more supplies until February of the following year.

The initial supply to the Mafeking post office was a little involved. Although the larger part of the
stamp stock had been retained by the Accountant-General at his office in Mafeking, it was the Civil
Commissioner at Vryburg, in his capacity as Postmaster-General, who made the supply for postal
purposes. On 15 December 1885 he forwarded the following quantities to the Accountant-General for
onward transmission to the Resident Magistrate at Mafeking, who had been appointed postmaster:
1d 5 sheets 6d 5 sheets
2d 5 sheets
The supply was accompanied by the following instruction to the postmaster: “Please do your
utmost to cause the public to prepay letters with British Bechuanaland postage stamps as much
trouble will be saved at the dispatching and receiving offices”.
These three offices, at Vryburg, Mafeking and Taung, were the only ones providing postal services
in December 1885.
No 4d or 1s stamps were sent in this initial consignment although they were values in current
use in Cape Colony and were included in the original order. No satisfactory explanation has been
offered to account for this omission, although possibilities include prior cancellation of these values
by the British Bechuanaland authorities, misinterpretation or deliberate amendment of the order by
the Cape Postmaster-General or a shortage of stock of the basic stamps required for overprinting.
The ‘shortage’ theory is highly unlikely since a gap of around 1½ years was to ensue before the four
pence stamps were finally delivered, overprinted on stamps with Crown CC watermark which must
have been in the Cape Postmaster-General’s stock for a number of years.

Overprint Trials on the Halfpenny Stamp
The difficulty of producing a clearly visible overprint in black ink on a stamp whose basic colour was
grey-black must have caused the printer some problems. Two varieties of colour in the overprint
for the halfpenny stamp are recorded, and I think it possible that these come from sheets used by
the printer as trials.
The two varieties and the issued stamp, illustrated here (Figs 2, 3 & 4), carry the Crown CA
watermark, which identifies them as coming from the first issue; all subsequent over printings of
the halfpenny value being on stamps with Anchor watermark.
The distinctive lake overprint is a very rare stamp. At one time only a single repaired mint
copy was recorded in the Holmes collection (now in the Botswana Postal Museum) and a single
used copy was known in the Royal Collection. Over the last decade two further mint examples
and two used ones have been recorded. The rarity of this lake overprint, and its existence in mint
and used state in equal quantities, seems to indicate that it was put into stock and issued, being
considered of sufficient similarity to the red colour of the overprint on the issued stamp not to
warrant rejection.
The status of the second variety, where the overprint is doubled, once in lake and once in black,
is more difficult to explain. The deliberate production of a double overprint on an issued stamp
would have created almost insurmountable difficulties. Consistent registration of one overprint
on top of the other would have been virtually impossible to control. Examination of the stamp
reveals that the lake overprint was done first, followed by the black. It is therefore possible that it
was simply an experiment to determine the effect of a black overprint, but the printer, rather than
use up another new sheet of Cape halfpenny stamps, took his lake overprinted sheet and applied
the black overprint, in its probable setting covering 120 stamps, to half the sheet.
Contrary to the case of the lake overprint, the double overprint seems to have been rejected as
unfit for issue, and was possibly sold off to dealers to recoup the cost of the stamps. This theory is
supported by two observations: firstly the stamp is unknown in used condition, and secondly it is
much more common in mint condition than should be the case had it been issued. The halfpenny
Cape stamp used for the overprint is always centred low and to the right, which indicates that all
copies came originally from a single sheet. Multiples are unknown.
Later Overprintings
Further supplies of overprinted Cape of Good Hope stamps were ordered before the issue was finally
superseded by the definitive “Unappropriated Dies” issue on 19 January 1888.

The second supply was received from the Cape Postmaster-General on 25 November 1886. The
quantities and values received were:
½d grey-black, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 50 sheets
1d rose-red, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 50 sheets
2d pale bistre, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 25 sheets
1s green, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 50 sheets
This supply contained two new stamps. The overprint on the halfpenny stamp was carried out using
black ink instead of red on stamps with Cabled Anchor watermark instead of Crown CA, and a one
shilling value was introduced for the first time. These new stamps are illustrated in Figs 5 and 6.
An initial supply of one shilling stamps was made to the Vryburg Postmaster on 26 November
1886, which can now be accepted as the first day of issue. It is impossible to determine the first day
of issue for the halfpenny grey-black with black overprint. Although one sheet of this value was
issued to the postmaster on the same day as the one shilling stamps, it could well have been from
the first (red) overprinting since, at this date there were five sheets of halfpenny stamps overprinted
in red remaining in the Civil Commissioner’s stock. On the assumption that he used up the old
stock first, the initial supply of halfpenny stamps with black overprint would have been made to the
Vryburg postmaster on 24 December 1886, since on that day the records show that he was issued
with five sheets of stamps, which would inevitably have exhausted the stock of red overprints. These
two dates, 26 November and 24 December, represent the earliest and latest possible dates of issue
for this particular stamp.

In the meantime the Imperial Authority in London had difficulty in agreeing a minimal-cost
solution for the introduction of a range of definitive stamps for the colony. This caused even further delays, resulting in a complaint by the Administrator, Sir Sidney Shippard to the Board of Inland Revenue stamping department in London stating that he would need to get a further interim supply from the Cape postal authorities.

The resulting third supply arrived from Cape Town on 1 June 1887 and comprised:

1d rose-red, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 25 sheets
2d pale bistre, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 25 sheets
4d dull blue, overprint in black Crown CC watermark 25 sheets

This supply saw the introduction of the 4d stamp (Fig. 7), thus completing the series of
denominations originally ordered.

An initial stock of this value was issued to the Vryburg postmaster on 2 June 1887, and this can be taken as the first day of issue. I am unable to comment on Holmes reference to a reported sighting of the stamp in the February 1887 issue of The Philatelic Record, since I have not had the opportunity to read that particular issue of the magazine. I can only state that the official Register of Stamp Accounts, from which all the figures given in this article are taken, is very specific as regards dates and quantities for receipts and supplies of each individual denomination.

A fourth and final supply was received around seven weeks later, on 19 July 1887. The quantities were as follows:

½d grey-black, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 50 sheets
1d rose-red, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 100 sheets
6d reddish-purple, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 25 sheets
1s green, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 40 sheets

The following table summarises the supplies in number of sheets for the entire issue.

½d 1d 2d 3d 4d 6d 1s
First supply: 2 Dec 1885 100 200 250 50 - 100 -
Second supply: 25 Nov 1885 50 50 25 - - - 50
Third supply: 1 Jun 1887 - 25 25 - 25 - -
Fourth supply: 19 Jul 1887 50 75 100 - - 25 40
Total sheets overprinted 200 350 400 50 25 125 90
Total stamps overprinted 48,000 84,000 96,000 12,000 6,000 30,000 21,600

No records have been found to prove whether the third and fourth supplies were deliveries
resulting from two separate orders or were two split parts of a single order.


\section{Printing Plates Used for the Cape of Good Hope Stamps}

The printing plates and current numbers for the sheets of stamps overprinted for use in British Bechuanaland are as follows:

Plate Number Current Number

\begin{tabular}{lll}
1/2d (red or black overprint) &1 &43\\
1d &6 &-\\
2d &2 &-\\
3d &1 &-\\
4d &2 &3\\
6d &1 &16\\
1s &1 &17\\
\end{tabular}

The Current Number was a De La Rue procedure which denoted the order in which some early
plates were made, regardless of designated values or territories.

Few marginal multiples have survived, but over a considerable period of time most of the above have been observed. The one exception is the 1s value where the numbers given are those known to exist on sheets of the unoverprinted 1s Cape stamp

\section{Withdrawal from Sale and Disposal of Remainders}

Most values of the new “Unappropriated Dies” definitive series, which were intended to replace the overprinted Cape stamps were received from His Honour the Administrator by the “Chief Distributor of Stamps” on 2 July 1887, over two weeks prior to the receipt of the of the final supply of overprinted Cape stamps. There were no overprinted GB ½d vermilion stamps included in the supply, nor any 2d or 4d values, since at this time none had been received from De La Rue in London.

A quantity of all available values of the new issue was immediately transferred to the stock of the “Sub-Distributor of Stamps” and placed on sale for Revenue purposes only. This was because the stamps carried the inscription “Postage & Revenue”, and Cape Colony law, which was also in force in British Bechuanaland, prohibited the use of dual purpose stamps. This law was not repealed until 1 November 1887, however there was an urgent need to replace Stellaland revenue stamps, which were still in current use, so the sale of “Unappropriated Dies” stamps was permitted from 2 July for revenue purposes only, provided the word “postage” was first struck out in manuscript by the user.

Despite the repeal of the law, the records show that the provisional overprinted Cape stamps remained on sale for postal purposes until 19 January 1888, when the “Unappropriated Dies” were finally distributed to post offices.

Remaining stocks were not withdrawn from the post offices, and it seems probable that they
were simply allowed to sell through; no doubt mainly to dealers.

A provisional “reserve” of stamps for Whitfield King of Ipswich had been pencilled in the
accounts as early as 26 July 1887. These were finally sent out, albeit in revised quantities, via the Crown Agents on 9 May 1888. The quantities, totalling £50 face value, were as follows:

½d 25 sheets 4d 1 sheet
1d 5 sheets 6d 1 sheet
2d 3 sheets 1s 210 single stamps.
3d 2 sheets

On 11 May, the small remaining stocks of 2d and 6d stamps were sent to the Vryburg post office, leaving just 3d and 4d denominations in the Distributor’s stock. These latter stamps had seen little postal use throughout the entire period, each having be overprinted in very small quantities on just one occasion. Throughout the rest of 1888 the Vryburg postmaster continued to order 3d and 4d stamps, and a final significant supply of six sheets of the 3d was made to the Mafeking postmaster on 17 December.

The account book record for the provisional issue closed on 31 December 1888 with just 12 sheets of 3d and 12 sheets of 4d stamps remaining in stock. Their eventual disposal is not recorded. It is interesting to note, however, that both these values are recorded with the rare ‘Specimen’ handstamp known as ‘Samuel Type BEC1’ (Fig. 8). This was a handstamp applied locally at Vryburg some time during 1889 to a very small number of sets of all stamp denominations currently in the stock of the Chief
Distributor. This suggests that the 3d and 4d remainders had still not been dispersed at the time.

The entire series retained postal validity throughout the existence of British Bechuanaland up to its annexation to Cape Colony on 16 November 1895. They remained valid in the Bechuanaland Protectorate up to 31 March 1938, from which date the use of all earlier overprinted stamps was prohibited.

\section{The Overprint Setting}

The records show that all values were received from the printers overprinted in complete sheets of 240 stamps. Two questions arise from this: how many panes of 60 stamps were covered by the overprint setting and was the type dispersed after each printing and reset for the next?

It is unfortunate that no complete panes of this issue have survived, let alone complete sheets. The few panes that were offered for sale in the early 1900s have been broken up and most of the handful of large blocks that survived have disappeared from sight. This makes it almost impossible to offer a complete picture.

Holmes was of the opinion that the size of the overprint setting was 120 covering two adjacent horizontal panes of 60. As a consequence, each sheet of stamps would have been introduced twice to the printing press in order to complete the overprint. I agree with these conclusions and include the strip shown in Figures 10 and 11 in support:

This strip, originally in the collection of Emil Tamsen, is in fact a single piece, but is shown here in two parts so that it can be illustrated to scale. Had the overprint setting covered just one pane of 60 stamps, then the overprint covering the top row of the left hand pane would be identical to the overprint covering the top row of the right hand pane. It is clear that this is not the case. It is only necessary to examine the third stamp of the left pane and observe the raise letters “and” in “Bechuanaland”. This variety does not repeat in the third stamp of the right pane as would have been the case had the overprint setting covered only a single pane. The line of the overprint is not perfectly horizontal but follows a gentle curve indicating a degree of over tightening of the moveable type in the printing forme.

It is also interesting to note that the spacing between each overprint is too great and does not
perfectly match the stamps. This results in the overprint, which starts to the left on the first stamp
of the row, progressively advancing to the right until the last stamp of the row is reached.
Proof that the overprint applied to the lower two panes was identical to that applied to the
upper ones is provided by the pair of 1d stamps illustrated (Fig. 12). The perforated gutter margin
shows that they are from the top row of a lower pane. The position of the watermark in the margin
allows us to plate the stamps to positions one and two. A direct comparison is therefore possible
with the 4d stamps in the corresponding position of the upper frame. Whilst it is unfortunate that
stamp 3, with the raised “and”, has been detached, electronic superimposition of images taken from
the overprints produces a virtually perfect match if one allows for differences in the amount of ink applied. The left hand stamp also follows the same curve from the horizontal that is observed in the
4d strip. This should not be expected had the setting been 240, since the overprint applied to this
particular stamp would have then been half way down the setting, not at the top left hand cover. It
would not have been subjected to the pressures of over tightening in the same way so that the curve
in the line of the overprint would almost certainly not have been present.
It is likely that the type was dispersed; at least between the first three printings. This can be
supported by a study of the catalogued varieties in the overprint, as discussed in the following
section. It may well be that the overprint forme used for the third printing was retained for the
fourth since they were completed only weeks apart. No evidence has been found which can either prove or disprove this. The 4d stamps illustrated above came from the third printing as has been
shown. The 1d stamps illustrated were produced by the same overprint forme, however it is known that 1d stamps were delivered in every supply.

\section{Important Overprint Errors}

There are three major overprint errors in the series that have achieved catalogue status. These are: the missing ‘B’ to British’, the missing dot over the first ‘i’ of ‘British’ and the double overprints.

The ‘ ritish’ error is known on just four values: ½d with black overprint, 1d, 2d and 1s (Figs 13 & 14). The position of the error in the setting is unknown. Two complete panes of the halfpenny, one containing the ‘ritish’ error and the other not, were listed as lots 97 and 98 of Emil Tamsen’s sale at Ventom, Bull and Cooper’s in London on 10 May 1900. Regrettably, the position was not recorded and the panes are assumed to have been broken up after the sale. Holmes stated that it was in the fourth vertical column of one of the panes, possibly R4/4 of the right hand pane. He offered no evidence to support his statement, and I can find none, other than by reference again to Tamsen’s sale where lot 99 offered a horizontal strip of five; the error being the centre stamp. This places it
in either column three or column four of one of the panes.

When a particular overprint error occurs on more than one value of an issue, it is reasonable
to assume that the error was present either throughout the printing or started at a very early stage.
By reference to the earlier table of overprinting dates and quantities, it is easy to see that the only
printing which contained the above four stamps, but none of the other values in the series, is the
second supply of 25 November 1886. It seems fairly safe to deduce from this observation not only
that the second overprinting was the one involved, but that the overprint setting had been broken
up and reset during the intervening year between the first and second supplies.
The missing dot over the first ‘i’ of ‘British is listed as occurring on four values: 1d, 2d, 3d and
6d (Figs 15 & 16).

Following the same logic previously applied to the ‘ritish’ error it will be observed, by reference
back to the table of overprint dates and quantities, that the only printing which contains all the values
illustrated above is the first supply. The match is not quite perfect, since the missing dot variety has
never been discovered on the halfpenny grey-black with red overprint, which was the remaining
value in that supply. However, the number of reported sightings for this error is even less that the
more widely recognised ‘ ritish’ error, so the possibility remains that the missing halfpenny stamp
will be discovered one day. It is also possible that the dot was damaged during the cleaning of the
forme, to remove the red ink, prior to its use with black ink for the remainder of the printing.

For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to mention a single copy of this error which has been reported on the halfpenny stamp with black overprint. This is in the Botswana Postal Museum and is currently not available for research. If it proves to be identical to the overprint on the illustrated stamps, then the theory assigning the error exclusively to the first supply is flawed. However, it could be one of those non-constant ‘fails to print’ flaws that are so frequently encountered in locally overprinted stamps.

Holmes stated the position of this error to be R10/3 of the left hand pane. I can find no evidence to support this statement, but it is possible that none of the blocks I have seen covering this position are from the first printing.


\section{Double Overprints}

The double overprints are listed on just three values, the ½d, 1d and 2d. In the case of the 1d and 2d (Figs 17 & 18), the double overprints lie very close to each other, as can be seen from the illustrations. They largely escaped detection at the time, which accounts for the existence of singlefigure numbers of each in used state only. A single mint copy of the halfpenny with black overprint double is housed in the Botswana Postal museum. This was listed as Lot 1018 in the ‘Holmes’ sale at Harmers on 28-29 October 1981, and a rather indistinct illustration appears in the catalogue, nevertheless it is clear enough to show that the two overprints are almost coincident. I would very much like to examine this stamp, since my impression from the illustration is that the overprint is
slightly too long.

Holmes states that in the case of the 1d stamp “the cancellation is invariably ‘534’, the number allotted to Kuruman”. This is almost correct insofar as it goes, but in the light of current knowledge it is safer to say that where the Barred Oval Numeral Canceller can be distinguished, it invariable carries the number ‘534’ for Kuruman. Additionally, a single copy of the error has been reported cancelled with a part strike of the Vryburg Circular Date Stamp, but only the year ‘87’ is discernible.

Despite this, I feel it safe to accept that just one single pane of 120 stamps carrying the double overprint error was issued to Kuruman post office.

The position with regard to the 2d stamp is less ambiguous. All but two examples are cancelled with a circular datestamp; and it is invariably ‘Mafeking’. The remaining two stamps are cancelled with barred-oval numeral 638, the number assigned to Mafeking.

\subsection{Minor Overprint Varieties}

Minor varieties mainly concern uneven letters or groups of letters in the overprint. In the most commonly encountered and easily recognisable variety the letters ‘and’ of ‘Bechuanaland’ are raised out of line (Figs 19 & 20).

I have observed this variety on all values of the issue with the exception of the halfpenny stamp with red overprint and the 1s value. There is, however, no reason to suppose they do not exist.

What is important to note is that the raised ‘and’ is not exclusive to a single position in the setting. On the ½d (black overprint), 1d and 2d values the overprint variety has been observed on the stamp immediately to the left of the ‘ ritish variety’, and therefore must fall in the second or third vertical row of one of the panes. On the 4d stamp it is at R1/3 of the left hand pane, but the spacing of the overprint letters is different. The position on the 6d stamp is unknown, but the observed measurements are different yet again.

Holmes does not mention this variety, but instead discusses one where the raised letters ‘land’ in
‘Bechuanaland’ occur. He states its position as No. 53 of the right-hand pane, but offers no evidence
to support this. In many years of collecting this particular issue, I have yet to discover a single copy
of such a variety, and suspect that Holmes may have committed a slip and actually been referring
to the raised ‘and’ variety as described. If this is the case, then his position 53 identification must be
viewed with caution. Certainly no unusual overprint was observed in blocks of ½d (black overprint),
2d and 6d stamps covering this position.

\section{Forgeries}

No article on the first provisional issue would be complete without a discussion of the multitude of forgeries that are to be found, many of them being the work of Benjamin and Sarpy in London.

Used Cape of Good Hope stamps were available very cheaply in abundant quantities and they set
about applying the black ‘British Bechuanaland’ overprint not only to the issued values but also to
the 5s orange Cape stamp which was never issued in the Colony.
The type font used is correct, and the length of each word matches the dimensions of the
genuine overprint. It can be condemned because the separation between the lines of the overprint
is a fraction of a millimetre too great and also because the ink used does not produce as crisp an
impression as the genuine. There are other problems with the illustrated stamp that allow it to be
condemned more easily: it has a part circular datestamp for ‘Port Elizabeth’ in Cape Colony, the
overprint is applied on top of the postmark and the stamp has the ‘Crown CA’ watermark, not the
‘Cabled Anchor’ to be expected in the genuine.
The correct measurements for the genuine overprint ±0.1 mm are:
‘British’ 7.4 mm long excluding serifs
‘Bechuanaland’ 15.4 mm long excluding serifs
separation 3.8 mm between lines measured from the
bottom of ‘r’ in ‘British’ to the top of ‘u’ in ‘Bechuanaland’
Many of the forged overprints are so crude they cannot possibly deceive, but if any doubt remains,
especially in the case of used stamps, then the following questions should be applied:
Are the dimensions correct?

Is the overprint crisp? Is there no full stop after ‘Bechuanaland’? Is the watermark correct? Is the cancel, if visible, one used at a British Bechuanaland post office?

Unused stamps with forged overprints are seldom encountered because of the cost to the forger in purchasing them.

The most famous ones were produced at Kimberley in South Africa reputedly to the order of the well known philatelist, Emil Tamsen. Tamsen apparently purchased quantities of the three lowest values of Cape stamps, ½d 1d and 2d, and set about applying not only simple overprints, but also ‘ritish’ errors, inverted overprints, double overprints, double overprints (one inverted), etc. Moreover, with the connivance of an official at the post office, he obtained the use of the genuine ‘Vryburg’ barred oval numeral canceller (Fig. 23) and single circle date stamp cancellers and proceeded to cancel a quantity with these. Luckily the overprint is much too long, and should only deceive a collector unfamiliar with the genuine.

Many years later, he used some of these stamps to contrive a small number of covers which he self-addressed and put through the normal post. An example is shown at Figure 24.
A large and interesting collection of the ‘Tamsen’ forgeries, donated
by the late Ernest Hunt of South Africa, is held by the Royal Philatelic
Society London.

Despite his occasional stray from the ‘straight and narrow’, Emil
Tamsen was on balance a philatelist of considerable learning and
influence who, in his time, undoubtedly made great contributions to
the philately of Southern Africa.

I have discussed in detail just two of the forged overprints
encountered. There are many more, and a full listing would probably
double the length of this article without offering much more
information. Any philatelist following the principles I have outlined
above should be able to distinguish the genuine from the forgery.

\section{Conclusion}

It is not my intention to claim that this is the final story. The shortage of detailed records for the period, and the failure of a single complete pane to survive, has led to much inference and personal interpretation in this account. It is possible that, by the time this article is published, some new piece of evidence will have emerged that causes me to change my opinion on some aspect; but then for me, that is philately.

If just one person is sufficiently stimulated by this article to take an active interest in the stamps of British Bechuanaland, a colony which issued just 39 basic stamps in its ten year existence, or if it encourages existing collectors to re-examine their holdings in a new light, then I am well satisfied.

\section{Acknowledgements}

I am particularly indebted to David Parsons of Spink for allowing me to scan a number of items from the collection of the late Sir John Inglefield-Watson to produce illustrations for this article; to Alan MacGregor of Simon’s Town, South Africa, for providing the illustrations of the 2d and 1s ‘ritish’ errors and to Brian Fenemore FRPSL of Cape Town for the illustration of the 6d no dot to first ‘i’ of ‘British’ error. Last, but by no means least, I am most grateful to Brian Trotter FRPSL for sparing his valuable time to proof-read this article.

Covers are worth a substantial premium and so do blocks which are particularly rare. Beware of forged blocks.

Essays and specimens exist for this issue.

{{warning: Forgeries exist for all values. The genuine overprints are 15.25-15.5 mm wide and the spacing between 3.75-4 mm.
}}

The issue was followed by those using the unappropriated dies and overprints on 
Great Britain stamps.
