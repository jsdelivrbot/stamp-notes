# 1885-1886 Bechuanaland Postage Stamps on Cape of Good Hope Overprinted Stamps


A comprehensive study of the stamps was published in the \textit{London Philatelist} by Brian Hurst. In 2007 Hurst came across chance discovery of an accounts  record in the Cape National Archives with details of all the stamps issued to the newly formed Colony. The account book titled
\textit{Bechuanaland Crown Colony - Office of the Receiver and Accountant General - Register Stamp Accounts} – 1885/1889  provided new information regarding the early issues.
What Hurst discovered was effectively an accounts book; but rather than dealing with income and expenditure it records
the receipt and issue, by dates and quantities, of all postage and revenue stamps for the period. It
gives an exact record of printing quantities, dates of receipt and dates of issue for each individual
denomination and its analysis provides a major step forward in improving the knowledge of the
stamps of the period. These figures were published in his article for the first time and provides answers to much of the speculation that has occurred over the last few decades.

\section{The Initial Supply}

The Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland was proclaimed on 30 September 1885 following the
successful expedition led by Major-General Sir Charles Warren to annex the Boer Republics of [Stellaland](../stelland/Introduction) and Goshen. A rudimentary postal service was already in existence at Vryburg, the chief town of Stellaland, and this, together with its stock of postage stamps, was taken over by the new British authority. Good communication was an essential element of British colonial government, and having already established a comprehensive telegraph system during the military campaign, it was considered essential to expand the postal services. An order was therefore placed with the Postmaster-General of Cape Colony to provide quantities of suitably overprinted stamps of all denominations currently used in Cape Colony, with the exception of the five shilling value.

Consequently, instructions were given to Messrs W.A. Richards & Son of Cape Town, official printers to the Government of Cape Colony, asking them to overprint current stamps of the Cape of Good Hope with the words ‘British Bechuanaland’.

The overprint was applied to complete undivided sheets of 240 stamps comprising four panes
of 60 stamps each, separated by gutters in the form of a cross, and the initial consignment, which comprised the five values illustrated (Fig. 1), arrived at the office of the Accountant-General in Mafeking on 30 November 1885.

The quantity of stamps received from Cape Town for each value was as follows:

\begin{tabular}{lll}
½d grey-black, overprint in red &Crown CA watermark &100 sheets\\
1d rose-red, overprint in black &Cabled Anchor watermark &200 sheets\\
2d pale bistre, overprint in black &Cabled Anchor watermark &250 sheets\\
3d pale claret, overprint in black &Crown CA watermark &50 sheets\\
6d reddish purple, overprint in black &Cabled Anchor watermark &100 sheets\\
\end{tabular}

For the first few months of its existence, the new colonial administration of British Bechuanaland was based at Mafeking, with the Governor of Cape Colony and High Commissioner for South
Africa, Sir Hercules Robinson, serving as the ultimate authority for British Bechuanaland through
his appointed local administrator, Sir Sidney Shippard, a former Cape Colony judge. The postal
administration for the colony was however, for practical reasons, based at Vryburg. The official
responsible for distribution of the 1885 postage stamps from Vryburg is described in the Stamp
Accounts Register as “C.C. Vryburg”, which I have interpreted as “Civil Commissioner, Vryburg”.
This would be Mr. A. Faure Robertson, who is recorded as being Civil Commissioner, Postmaster-
General and Resident Magistrate at Vryburg at the time. The colony had a very small population in
its early days, and many officials were expected to undertake duties in more than one capacity.
On 2 December 1885, the Civil Commissioner at Vryburg recorded the receipt of the following
quantities of stamps from the Accountant-General in Mafeking:

\begin{verbatim}
½d 25 sheets 3d 20 sheets
1d 50 sheets 6d 25 sheets
2d 100 sheets
\end{verbatim}

On the same day, the Civil Commissioner, in his capacity as distributor of stamps, sent the following
quantities to the Resident Magistrate at Taung, who had been appointed to act as postmaster:

\begin{verbatim}
½d 2 sheets 3d 1 sheet
1d 5 sheets 6d 1 sheet
2d 5 sheets
\end{verbatim}


I think it highly unlikely that the supplies arrived in time for them to be put on sale at Taung,
roughly nine hours distance from Vryburg, on the 2nd, and consider the following day, 3rd December
1885, to be the most likely first day of issue to the public. This is supported by the fact that the
postmaster at Vryburg, the site of the principal post office, was not issued with his stamps until 3rd
December. The quantities he received were:

\begin{tabular}{lll}

1/2 d 1/2 sheet && 3d 1 sheet \\
1d 1 sheet && 6d 2 sheets \\
2d 5 sheets && 0 \\
\end{tabular}

No doubt these quantities were considered adequate in view of the speed with which the supply
chain could replenish stocks at the Vryburg post office. This is supported by an entry in the records
showing that the Vryburg postmaster needed a further sheet of 2d stamps only nine days later,
whereas Taung received no more supplies until February of the following year.

The initial supply to the Mafeking post office was a little involved. Although the larger part of the
stamp stock had been retained by the Accountant-General at his office in Mafeking, it was the Civil
Commissioner at Vryburg, in his capacity as Postmaster-General, who made the supply for postal
purposes. On 15 December 1885 he forwarded the following quantities to the Accountant-General for
onward transmission to the Resident Magistrate at Mafeking, who had been appointed postmaster:

1d 5 sheets 6d 5 sheets

2d 5 sheets

The supply was accompanied by the following instruction to the postmaster: “Please do your
utmost to cause the public to prepay letters with British Bechuanaland postage stamps as much trouble will be saved at the dispatching and receiving offices”.

These three offices, at Vryburg, Mafeking and Taung, were the only ones providing postal services in December 1885.

No 4d or 1s stamps were sent in this initial consignment although they were values in current use in Cape Colony and were included in the original order. No satisfactory explanation has been offered to account for this omission, although possibilities include prior cancellation of these values by the British Bechuanaland authorities, misinterpretation or deliberate amendment of the order by the Cape Postmaster-General or a shortage of stock of the basic stamps required for overprinting.

The ‘shortage’ theory is highly unlikely since a gap of around 1½ years was to ensue before the four
pence stamps were finally delivered, overprinted on stamps with Crown CC watermark which must
have been in the Cape Postmaster-General’s stock for a number of years.

\section{Overprint Trials on the Halfpenny Stamp}

The difficulty of producing a clearly visible overprint in black ink on a stamp whose basic colour was grey-black must have caused the printer some problems. Two varieties of colour in the overprint for the halfpenny stamp are recorded, and I think it possible that these come from sheets used by the printer as trials.

The two varieties and the issued stamp, illustrated here (Figs 2, 3 & 4), carry the Crown CA watermark, which identifies them as coming from the first issue; all subsequent over printings of the halfpenny value being on stamps with Anchor watermark.

The distinctive lake overprint is a very rare stamp. At one time only a single repaired mint copy was recorded in the Holmes collection (now in the Botswana Postal Museum) and a single used copy was known in the Royal Collection. Over the last decade two further mint examples and two used ones have been recorded. The rarity of this lake overprint, and its existence in mint and used state in equal quantities, seems to indicate that it was put into stock and issued, being considered of sufficient similarity to the red colour of the overprint on the issued stamp not to warrant rejection.

The status of the second variety, where the overprint is doubled, once in lake and once in black,
is more difficult to explain. The deliberate production of a double overprint on an issued stamp
would have created almost insurmountable difficulties. Consistent registration of one overprint
on top of the other would have been virtually impossible to control. Examination of the stamp
reveals that the lake overprint was done first, followed by the black. It is therefore possible that it
was simply an experiment to determine the effect of a black overprint, but the printer, rather than
use up another new sheet of Cape halfpenny stamps, took his lake overprinted sheet and applied
the black overprint, in its probable setting covering 120 stamps, to half the sheet.
Contrary to the case of the lake overprint, the double overprint seems to have been rejected as
unfit for issue, and was possibly sold off to dealers to recoup the cost of the stamps. This theory is
supported by two observations: firstly the stamp is unknown in used condition, and secondly it is
much more common in mint condition than should be the case had it been issued. The halfpenny
Cape stamp used for the overprint is always centred low and to the right, which indicates that all
copies came originally from a single sheet. Multiples are unknown.

\section{Later Overprintings}

Further supplies of overprinted Cape of Good Hope stamps were ordered before the issue was finally superseded by the definitive “Unappropriated Dies” issue on 19 January 1888.

The second supply was received from the Cape Postmaster-General on 25 November 1886. The
quantities and values received were:

½d grey-black, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 50 sheets

1d rose-red, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 50 sheets

2d pale bistre, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 25 sheets

1s green, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 50 sheets

This supply contained two new stamps. The overprint on the halfpenny stamp was carried out using
black ink instead of red on stamps with Cabled Anchor watermark instead of Crown CA, and a one
shilling value was introduced for the first time. These new stamps are illustrated in Figs 5 and 6.

An initial supply of one shilling stamps was made to the Vryburg Postmaster on 26 November
1886, which can now be accepted as the first day of issue. It is impossible to determine the first day
of issue for the halfpenny grey-black with black overprint. Although one sheet of this value was
issued to the postmaster on the same day as the one shilling stamps, it could well have been from
the first (red) overprinting since, at this date there were five sheets of halfpenny stamps overprinted
in red remaining in the Civil Commissioner’s stock. On the assumption that he used up the old
stock first, the initial supply of halfpenny stamps with black overprint would have been made to the
Vryburg postmaster on 24 December 1886, since on that day the records show that he was issued
with five sheets of stamps, which would inevitably have exhausted the stock of red overprints. These
two dates, 26 November and 24 December, represent the earliest and latest possible dates of issue
for this particular stamp.

In the meantime the Imperial Authority in London had difficulty in agreeing a minimal-cost
solution for the introduction of a range of definitive stamps for the colony. This caused even further delays, resulting in a complaint by the Administrator, Sir Sidney Shippard to the Board of Inland Revenue stamping department in London stating that he would need to get a further interim supply from the Cape postal authorities.

The resulting third supply arrived from Cape Town on 1 June 1887 and comprised:

1d rose-red, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 25 sheets

2d pale bistre, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 25 sheets

4d dull blue, overprint in black Crown CC watermark 25 sheets

This supply saw the introduction of the 4d stamp (Fig. 7), thus completing the series of
denominations originally ordered.

An initial stock of this value was issued to the Vryburg postmaster on 2 June 1887, and this can be taken as the first day of issue. I am unable to comment on Holmes reference to a reported sighting of the stamp in the February 1887 issue of The Philatelic Record, since I have not had the opportunity to read that particular issue of the magazine. I can only state that the official Register of Stamp Accounts, from which all the figures given in this article are taken, is very specific as regards dates and quantities for receipts and supplies of each individual denomination.

A fourth and final supply was received around seven weeks later, on 19 July 1887. The quantities were as follows:

½d grey-black, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 50 sheets

1d rose-red, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 100 sheets

6d reddish-purple, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 25 sheets

1s green, overprint in black Cabled Anchor watermark 40 sheets

The following table summarises the supplies in number of sheets for the entire issue.

½d 1d 2d 3d 4d 6d 1s
First supply: 2 Dec 1885 100 200 250 50 - 100 -
Second supply: 25 Nov 1885 50 50 25 - - - 50
Third supply: 1 Jun 1887 - 25 25 - 25 - -
Fourth supply: 19 Jul 1887 50 75 100 - - 25 40
Total sheets overprinted 200 350 400 50 25 125 90
Total stamps overprinted 48,000 84,000 96,000 12,000 6,000 30,000 21,600

No records have been found to prove whether the third and fourth supplies were deliveries
resulting from two separate orders or were two split parts of a single order.


\section{Printing Plates Used for the Cape of Good Hope Stamps}

The printing plates and current numbers for the sheets of stamps overprinted for use in British Bechuanaland are as follows:

Plate Number Current Number

\begin{tabular}{lll}
1/2d (red or black overprint) &1 &43\\
1d &6 &-\\
2d &2 &-\\
3d &1 &-\\
4d &2 &3\\
6d &1 &16\\
1s &1 &17\\
\end{tabular}

The Current Number was a De La Rue procedure which denoted the order in which some early
plates were made, regardless of designated values or territories.

Few marginal multiples have survived, but over a considerable period of time most of the above have been observed. The one exception is the 1s value where the numbers given are those known to exist on sheets of the unoverprinted 1s Cape stamp

\section{Withdrawal from Sale and Disposal of Remainders}

Most values of the new “Unappropriated Dies” definitive series, which were intended to replace the overprinted Cape stamps were received from His Honour the Administrator by the “Chief Distributor of Stamps” on 2 July 1887, over two weeks prior to the receipt of the of the final supply of overprinted Cape stamps. There were no overprinted GB ½d vermilion stamps included in the supply, nor any 2d or 4d values, since at this time none had been received from De La Rue in London.

A quantity of all available values of the new issue was immediately transferred to the stock of the “Sub-Distributor of Stamps” and placed on sale for Revenue purposes only. This was because the stamps carried the inscription “Postage & Revenue”, and Cape Colony law, which was also in force in British Bechuanaland, prohibited the use of dual purpose stamps. This law was not repealed until 1 November 1887, however there was an urgent need to replace Stellaland revenue stamps, which were still in current use, so the sale of “Unappropriated Dies” stamps was permitted from 2 July for revenue purposes only, provided the word “postage” was first struck out in manuscript by the user.

Despite the repeal of the law, the records show that the provisional overprinted Cape stamps remained on sale for postal purposes until 19 January 1888, when the “Unappropriated Dies” were finally distributed to post offices.

Remaining stocks were not withdrawn from the post offices, and it seems probable that they
were simply allowed to sell through; no doubt mainly to dealers.

A provisional “reserve” of stamps for Whitfield King of Ipswich had been pencilled in the
accounts as early as 26 July 1887. These were finally sent out, albeit in revised quantities, via the Crown Agents on 9 May 1888. The quantities, totalling £50 face value, were as follows:

½d 25 sheets 4d 1 sheet

1d 5 sheets 6d 1 sheet

2d 3 sheets 1s 210 single stamps.

3d 2 sheets

On 11 May, the small remaining stocks of 2d and 6d stamps were sent to the Vryburg post office, leaving just 3d and 4d denominations in the Distributor’s stock. These latter stamps had seen little postal use throughout the entire period, each having be overprinted in very small quantities on just one occasion. Throughout the rest of 1888 the Vryburg postmaster continued to order 3d and 4d stamps, and a final significant supply of six sheets of the 3d was made to the Mafeking postmaster on 17 December.

The account book record for the provisional issue closed on 31 December 1888 with just 12 sheets of 3d and 12 sheets of 4d stamps remaining in stock. Their eventual disposal is not recorded. It is interesting to note, however, that both these values are recorded with the rare ‘Specimen’ handstamp known as ‘Samuel Type BEC1’ (Fig. 8). This was a handstamp applied locally at Vryburg some time during 1889 to a very small number of sets of all stamp denominations currently in the stock of the Chief
Distributor. This suggests that the 3d and 4d remainders had still not been dispersed at the time.

The entire series retained postal validity throughout the existence of British Bechuanaland up to its annexation to Cape Colony on 16 November 1895. They remained valid in the Bechuanaland Protectorate up to 31 March 1938, from which date the use of all earlier overprinted stamps was prohibited.
