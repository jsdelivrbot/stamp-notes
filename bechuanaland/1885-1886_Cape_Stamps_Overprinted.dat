Covers are worth a substantial premium and so do blocks which are particularly rare. Beware of forged blocks.

Essays and specimens exist for this issue.
<div style="clear:both"></div>

{{warning: Forgeries exist for all values. The genuine overprints are 15.25-15.5 mm wide and the spacing between 3.75-4 mm.
}}

The issue was followed by those using the unappropriated dies and overprints on 
Great Britain stamps.
