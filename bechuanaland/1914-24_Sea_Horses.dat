##Bechuanaland - Stamps and Postal History

###1914-24 Sea Horses

It was at the King's behest that the Australian sculptor, 
Bertram Mackennal, ARA, was asked among others, to design the 
stamps of the new sovereign, including the high values. His submission 
showed Britannia standing in a symbolic shell chariot, holding a trident 
and shield, and being drawn across a choppy sea by three horses. 
Although something not dissimilar had appeared on Barbados stamps, 
the design was seen as a radical departure.

Never before had a pictorial 
illustration appeared on a British stamp. To members of the public, 
however, the quality of printing of the new issue was far more interesting than 
the dowdy surface-printed stamps they had endured for so long.

###Distinguishing Between the Different Printings

5s (top) Waterlow, 2/6d (middle) De La Rue wide tooth, 2/6d (bottom) Bradbury Wilkinson (wider design)
}

If you don't have examples available to help identify a printing, 
I find the explanation of the differences between printings in the Great Britain section 
of the Stanley Gibbons Commonwealth Catalog to be quite a reliable and faithful. 
The Bradbury Wilkinson printing is easy to identify because of its larger size, always measuring a bit more than the exact 22mm of the first Waterlow and De La Rue printings. The second Waterlow printing features a revised  pattern behind the king's head that is entirely different and easily distinguishable from the diagonal shading lines in the earlier printings. Telling the first Waterlow and De La Rue printings apart requires more careful study, but the patchy, thinner 
gum and wider top perforation of the De La Rue printings does begin to be readily identifiable with experience.

The [Great Overprint Society](http://www.gbos.org.uk/index.php/Country_List/5) also has a lot of 
valuable information in this regard.

###Bradbury Wilkinson & Co. (1920)

The Bradbury Wilson set in identical design was issued in 1920. The Bradbury Wilkinson printing is easy to identify because of its larger size, always measuring a bit more 
than the exact 22mm of the first Waterlow and De La Rue printings.
