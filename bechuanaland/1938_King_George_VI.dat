In 1938 the King George V, stamps were replaced with those of King George VII. They kept the same design as those of his father,
King George V, with the 'cows' dominating the design. Specimens of the stamps exist (perforated).

The stamps were recess-printed by Messrs. Waterlow \& Sons.

They were to be used until 1945 when the Victory Issue was issued.
