\chapter{Bechuanaland Protectorate - King George VI}

In 1938 the King George VI, stamps were replaced with those of King George VI. They kept the same design as those of his father,
King George V, with the 'cows' dominating the design. Specimens of the stamps exist (perforated).

The stamps were recess-printed by Messrs. Waterlow \& Sons and are amongst the most attractive stamps of the British Empire.

These stamps were to be used until 1945 when the Victory stamps were issued.
