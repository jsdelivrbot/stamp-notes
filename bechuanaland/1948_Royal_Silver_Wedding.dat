##Bechuanaland - Stamps and Postal History

###1948 Royal Silver Wedding

This omnibus issue had an unusual, and indeed undesirable, feature of this proposed new issue was that it was to consist of two values-a stamp
of low value and a stamp of high value; in the case of Bechuanaland it was to be the 10 shilling.

\subsubsection{SG 136-137}

Energetic protests against the issue of the \pound1 stamp were made on the grounds that it was a speculative
emission designed not to commemorate a personal anniversary of the King and Queen but to bring dollars and other foreign
currency into the empire from stamp collectors abroad. The royal Philatelic Society, with the full support of
philatelists and dealers, felt it was their duty to warn collectors against the purchase of all the high values in the 
series which fulfilled no postal requirement and to ignore the stamp. Like all similar such efforts it failed and the 
high value stamps were collected in the normal way. If they became a good investment is arguable but nevertheless they did
rise in value.

A variety exists (extra medal), where a small white spot to the right (on the stamp) of 
the King's medal can be found. (Third row 5th stamp).
