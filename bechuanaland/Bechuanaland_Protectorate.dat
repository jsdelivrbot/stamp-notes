# Bechuanaland - Stamps and Postal History

In 1803 the London Missionary Society established stations soon after earlier exploratory expeditions. In 1836 emigrant Boers made a defensive alliance with the
{{wi:Baralong}} tribe against the {{wi:Matabele}}, whom they then succeeded in defeating. Later the Boers repudiated promises related to agreed boundaries of territories.

Motsioa, the Baralong chief appealed to the High commissioner, resulting in 1853 in a treaty restoring his lands. Continued clashes occurred in 1877
when the Transvaal was annexed by Britain and comparative calm followed until the attempt by the boers to set up the short lived

## 1884 Warren Expedition

Sir Charles Warren
was sent out from England in command of an expeditionary force in October 1884.
The southern part of the country, was occupied in 1884 and declared a British possession on September 30th 1885.

A consignment of the unappropriated die types printed __Military Telegraphs__ was forwared at the end of November to Captain
Jelf, R.E., commanding the telegraph Corps and were received by him on board H.M.S. Pembroke Castle. What quantities and values were supplied
is not known, but they are the first adhesive stamps of Bechuanaland. 

When Sir Charles Warren marched into Vryburg on February 7th 1885, the postal system was taken over by the military and the Cape 6d. and 1/- postage stamps
overprinted __Military Telegraphs__. These stamps have only been found on telegraph envelopes and telegrams.

British Bechuanaland embraced the Stellaland Republic whose stamps ceased to be used from the time of the British Occupation. 

During 1885 and 1886 the posts were carried by the Bechuanaland Border Police. From May 1886 the mail to Kuruman was carried by native runners.

Postal agencies were established in 1886 at __Banks Drift__, __Kuruman__, __Poedomoe__, __Setlagoli__, in 1888 at __Palachwe__, 
in 1890 at __Macloutsie__ and in 1891 at __Keimoes__ and __Vryburg__.

##1895 Northern Bechauanaland procalimed a Protectorate

In 1895 Northern Bechuanaland was proclaimed a Protectorate and in 1895 (with the exclusion of some native areas) was transferred
to the British South Africa Co., within the sphere of whose operations it had been included by its Charter of 1890. Because of
the Company's complicity in the Jameson Raid and the objections raised by the local chieftains, this transfer was annulled, with
the exception of a small strip of land along the railway to Bulawayo was to be built, and the Protectorate passed back to the administration
of the Imperial Government in 1896.

The protectorate was administered from Mafeking, creating a unique situation of the 
capital of the territory being located outside of it. 

In 1885, when the protectorate was declared, Bechuanaland was bounded to the north by the latitude of 
twenty-two degrees south. 
The northern boundary of the Protectorate was formally extended northward by the British to include Ngamiland, which was dominated by the Tawana state, on 30 June 1890.[3] This claim was formally recognized by Germany the following day by Article III of the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty, which confirmed the western boundary of the British protectorate of Bechuanaland 
and the German protectorate of South-West Africa and 
also created the Caprivi strip inherited by modern Namibia
(See also the [Tati Concenssions](http://localhost/CodeIgniter/blogs/stamps/bechuanaland/Tati_concession)).

In November 1895 it was itself annexed to the Crown Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, 
and ceased to have an independent existence; its Revenue
stamps were replaced by those of the Cape.



The first stamps of Bechuanaland were Cape of Good Hope Seated Type, overprinted by W.A. Richards and Sons in capeTown.
