\subsection{1887 (November) Overprinted by De La Rue & Co.}

On July 12, 1887 the Inland Revenue handed De La Rue a requisition from the Administrator of British
Bechuanaland for seven duties. Easton quotes the closing sentence of the Administrator's letter, which
makes interesting reading and we quote:

<h4>SG 9</h4>
\ph[99%]{../bechuanaland/SG9.jpg}{
\halfd vermilion. SE corner strip of three with control 'D', with the marginal rule squared at the corner and perforated through the lower margin. Very fine mint. SG 9
\pound110
}

\begin{quotation}
As some time will necessarily elapse before an answer can be obtained from the Home Government as
to the additional requisition now submitted, I shall be compelled to get an interim supply of
stamps from the Cape Post Office. Care will, however, be taken to keep the quantities obtained within
the actual requirements; any surplus can always be disposed to Stamp Collectors in England.
\end{quotation}

Although seven denominations were mentioned in the Administrator's letter the firm only seem to 
have considered the Halfpenny.

Essays and specimens exist for this issue.

In December a one-half penny surcharge was printed by P. Townshend, at vryburg. The surcharge was printed in blocks of 60-5x12) in 
black ink. As the surcharges were printed locally a number of minor varieties due to bad printing abound.
Recognised varieties are __Hal__ for __Half__ and side lines of 7.5 mm instead of 11mm.

Covers and blocks are worth a substantial premium.
