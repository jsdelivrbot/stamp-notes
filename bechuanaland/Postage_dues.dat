##Bechuanaland - Stamps and Postal History

###1926 Postage Dues

The first postage due stamps of Bechuanaland were issued during the King George V reign. They were overprinted on postage due stamps of Great Britain.
 

<h4>SG D1-D3</h4>

  The post office had a problem finding enough white space on the 2d value 
  for the  overprint to be 
  visible and legible, so (presumably reluctantly) had to partly obscure the face value.

This issue is rare on cover. One such cover is shown below.
