Bechuanaland, Protectorate, Postal-Fiscal, 1918, £5 on 1/- Victoria Green, SG #F2, Never Hinged (only copy n.h. of the three known), "small colour run at foot", listed but unpriced in Stanley Gibbons (was priced some decades ago). Per H.R.Holmes "….Owing to a shortage of £5 stamps, required for fiscal purposes, recourse was had to surcharging, resulting in the production of this stamp. As the basic stamp was inscribed "Postage & Revenue" it could legally be used for either service.", Very Fine critical stamp for the Victoria collector or exhibitor. Articles about the issued stamp incl. with the lot. New Discovery Copy. Located in a small non-descript British Africa collection by the owner. Apparently the envelope that the £5 was located in was marked for $20 in the 1960s. BPA (2013) cert. (only copy of the three that is expertised). 
Scott #AR2 $18,000 + (hinged), This is the third mint copy known along with one that was postally used. None are recorded on document. A mint (ex P.L. Pemberton, T. Allen) and a postally used copy were offered in the "H.R. Holmes" Harmers of London auction in 1981. The hinged mint copy brought a hammer price of £3800 and sold to the Government of Botswana along with the postally used copy. The other recorded mint copy is part of the "Mosely Collection" which is in the British Library. This is the only copy that is in the public domain. . 
Estimate $15,000-25,000 

An argument can be made that the £5 should be listed under the "Regular Issue" section. Most British Africa adhesives of the period were inscribed "POSTAGE AND REVENUE". The high values most commonly were used for revenue purposes. It is generally accepted that £5 was the highest denomination actually used for postal purposes. The Bechuanaland stamp could be listed as a regular issue rather than as a postal fiscal. It is overprinted and the £5 stamp it replaced were both inscribed "Postage & Revenue" and listed as regular issue adhesives (example Scott# 16, 22, AR2). The used copy sold in the "H.R.Holmes" auction WAS POSTALLY USED. Comparison of 1918 Bechuanaland £5 with 1901 Rhodesia £100 (Scott#75B, mentioned in Gibbons) of SIMILAR RARITY - Rhodesia Gibbons states a number of mint known. Feldman records 2 specifically unused examples. Copy sold in 2011 Feldman Sale, described as part original gum, some minor toning, realized $165,000! Bechuanaland £5 only 3 known mint examples.
