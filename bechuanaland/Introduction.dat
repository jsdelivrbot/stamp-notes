##Bechuanaland - Stamps and Postal History


The first stamps of {{wi:Bechuanaland}} were Cape of Good Hope Seated Type, overprinted by W.A. Richards and Sons in CapeTown.

The protectorate was administered from Mafeking, creating a unique situation of the capital of the territory being located outside of it.


In [1887](../bechuanaland/1887_Overprints_on_Great_Britain_Stamps) the English 1/2 d. was surcharged, and the same year an approach was made to a more special issue by using what was known at Somerset House as the unappropriated die,
i.e. a die with a blank label on which might be printed the name of any country. A later
issue of these stamps in the following year (1888) was further surcharged with the figure
of value, as the value in words was apparently not considered to be clear enough. Then
followed surcharges on Cape stamps in [1889](../bechuanaland/1889-1891_Surcharge_on_Cape_Stamps), 1892, and 1894, again followed in 1891-94
with a series on English stamps with a final printing for British Bechuanaland on the Cape
1/2 d., green. In [1897](../bechuanaland/1897_Jubilee_Issue), the Jubilee British stamps were used overprinted for Bechuanaland.

In December a one-half penny surcharge was printed by P. Townshend, at vryburg. The surcharge was printed in blocks of 60-5x12) in 
black ink. As the surcharges were printed locally a number of minor varieties due to bad printing abound.
Recognised varieties are __Hal__ for __Half__ and side lines of 7.5 mm instead of 11mm.

Covers and blocks are worth a substantial premium.
