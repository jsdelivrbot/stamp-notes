With the Downey issue being very short-lived in 1913 Stamps of King George of Great Britain with the King George portrait rotated
as for other issues were overprinted for use in Bechuanaland. They can be found in large blocks and control numbers where
one can attempt to re-construct all the printings.

Control blocks can be found 'perforated through margin' or 'imperforate through margin'. See both example at left here.
In all cases where the lower margin is imperforate, one extension hole is present.
