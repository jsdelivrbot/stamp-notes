In 1864 gold was discovered in the Tati area, then part of the Matebele Kingdom, some 18 miles from Francistown, in the Bechuanaland Protectorate. In 1887 the Matebele chief, Lobengula, granted a concession to S H Edwards. Mining rights were vested in Tati Concessions Limited.

Tati Concessions Limited were given permission by the British Government to produce stamps for fiscal purposes. In 1895 six stamps were produced, a 1s deep carmine, a 2s 6d deep blue, a 5s violet, a 10s grey green, a \pound1 pale blue and a \pound5 orange. Some of the lower values were used for postal purposes.

In 1895 a set of revenue stamps were issued for use in the Tati concessions area. They were engraved and issued for fiscal purposes by
De La Rue & Co. They are watermarked with a rosette and perforated 14. The six values are 1/- deep carmine, 2/6 deep
blue, 5/- violet, 10/- grey-green, £1 pale blue and £5 orange. Proofs of the 1/- are known in green.

All the stamps with the exception of the five pound are known postally used but they were probably printed by favour.
