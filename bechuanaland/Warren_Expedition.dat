\chapter{The Warren Expedition}  

The history of the independent Republic of [Stellaland](../stellaland) is remarkable in several respects, and not least for its brevity. The Republic was established by Boer freebooters in 1882, but less than two years later, on 8 September 1884, they signed the Stellaland Agreement, accepting the proposed 'provisional arrangements for the regulation of affairs and the government of Stellaland pending Annexation of Stellaland to the Cape Colony'.
The Agreement was signed by the President, Secretary and Members of the Volksraad of the erstwhile Republic, and by Cecil Rhodes as Commissioner of Bechuanaland and 'Matabele' Thompson as his Secretary.

There, was, however, substantial opposition to the Agreement within Stellaland, and the neighbouring Republic of Goshen adamantly maintained a right of association with the Boer Republic of Transvaal, hence the recourse to military action. The Expedition led by Sir Charles Warren reached Vryburg, the capital of Stellaland, on 7 February 1885, but when they advanced into Goshen it was only to find that the Boers had returned to the Transvaal. The proclamation of the Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland on 30 September
1885 formalised the removal of the Republics of Stellaland and Goshen from the map. Rhodes had not only secured the route to the north, but had also made Boer expansion westwards impossible.

Warren's Bechuanaland Field Force comprised the Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment); the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons; detachments of the Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery; the 1st Mounted Rifles ('Methuen's Horse1); the 2nd Mounted Rifles ('Carrington's Horse'); the 3rd Mounted Rifles ('Cough's Horse*); and the 4th Pioneer Regiment This totalled approximately 5,000 men, including a high proportion of volunteers recruited in the UK (1st Mounted Rifles) and Cape Colony. Their equipment included the first war balloons ever taken
by the British Army into the field. The first trial ascent was made near Mafeking.

\section{Methuen Correspondence}
Many of the covers comprising the Methuen correspondence contain photocopies of single pages of the original letters recording when and where they were
written.

WARREN EXPEDITION: 1885 Officer's Letter from Lord Methuen to his wife in England franked Cape 6d. The adhesive tied Barkly GW cds 15 FE. Relevant transit & arrival marks, including those for redirection onwards to addressee. Some imperfections (see photo); a sound example of this desirable campaign mail. Filat CHF 575.}

The earliest Methuen cover (Fig.9) sent from Maritzani, near Mafeking, is franked with six Cape 1d stamps, which were cancelled at Barkly West on Sunday, 29 March 1885. The letter was therefore probably carried on the mail cart which was scheduled to leave Mafeking on Tuesday, 24 March, and arrive at Barkly West on the evening of the 28th. The 'T' mark indicating that it was underfranked was struck at Cape Town on 'AP 1/85' (backstamp). The manuscript annotation, '2/3', indicating the amount may have been written at
Barkly West as it was normal practice for Cape Town to indicate such amounts with a handstamp. (The receiving office would indicate whether or not any additional penalty was to be applied.) However, 2s 3d must
have been incorrect as the Cape rate to UK was 6d per half ounce. The letter was found open and resealed with
an official label by the Plymouth and Bristol Sorting Carriage on 'AP 22/85'. The manuscript annotation '2/3'
was cancelled with strikes of the obliterator coded 'B16', and a further handstamp struck to indicate that the
addressee was required to pay 2s 6d. The letter therefore presumably weighed between 2 \half and 3 oz.

The Methuen cover which contained a letter written at Sitlagoli between the 22 and 26 April 1885 was presumably despatched with the mail cart scheduled to leave Sitlagoli on Wednesday, 29 April, and arrive at Barkly West during the evening of Saturday, 2 May, as the franking, a single Cape 6d stamp, was cancelled there
on 'MY 3/85'. This letter was also underfranked, and was treated similarly to the first. The T mark was struck at
Cape Town on 'MY 6/85'. The manuscript annotation '9' is more likely to be an inverted '6', but was in any case again cancelled with the 'B16' obliterator and a further handstamp
struck to indicate that the addressee was to
pay Is. This letter therefore weighed between 1 and 1\half oz.
