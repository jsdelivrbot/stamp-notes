##Bechuanaland - Stamps and Postal History

## Books


Still the definitive guide for collectors
"The Postage Stamps, Postal Stationery, and Postmarks of the Bechuanalands" was published in 1971 by the R.P.S.
as a limited edition of 500 numbered copies for sale.

Although often accompanied by a white dust jacket, it is often most noticeable in its "unclad" deep orange livery. Cost of ownership is high. Copies are often seen offered at auction for £100 or more. But that is only the start of the cost of owning this inspirational book. As a collector "solely" of the stamps of the region I was tempted into the realms of Post Offices, Postmarks and Postal Stationery. And to get more up-to-date information I was led down the slippery slope to find myself writing these web pages and editing the Society's publications.
