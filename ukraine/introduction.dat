\section{Ukraine}  

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Ukraine.
Ukraine is a republic in Eastern Europe. It is bordered by the Russian Federation to the east; Belarus to the north; Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; Romania and Moldova to the southwest; and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south. Ukraine is a member of the CIS, and was a member of the USSR from 1922 to 1991. The city of Kiev is both the capital and the largest city of Ukraine.

\section{Zemstvo stamps}

Around 800 Russian Zemstvo stamps were issued in Ukraine between 1866 and 1917 at 39 locations. The first stamps were issued at Verkhnodniprovsk, Katerynoslav Guberniya, and in Dniprovsk, Tauridia Gubernia - both of which are now located in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.[1]

\section{Ukrainian People's Republic}

In 1918 an independent Ukrainian People's Republic was established and a series of five definitive stamps were issued. They were printed imperforate on thin paper and then on thicker paper with perforations.[2] The 10 and 20-shah stamps were designed by the artist Anton Sereda and the 30, 40, and 50-shah stamps by Heorhiy Narbut, a master graphic artist and president of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts in Kiev.

\section{Soviet republic}

A Ukrainian Soviet republic was declared on 14 March 1919 and a set of stamps were issued for famine relief in 1923. Ukraine used the stamps of the Soviet Union thereafter until the end of 1991, apart from during World War II.[2]


\section{World War II}

During the Second World War Ukraine was occupied by Germany. German stamps were used between 14 November 1941 and 1943 overprinted UKRAINE in small letters.[4] After liberation, Soviet stamps were used once again.

\section{Independent again}

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declared its independence and the first stamps of the new republic were issued on 1 March 1992.[2]
In 1992 the Ukrainian Post Office overprinted stamps of the Soviet Union with stylized tridents for use in Kiev, Lviv and Chernihiv.[2] 

Other Soviet stamps overprinted with similar designs are not believed to have been postally valid.
Since 1992, a variety of commemorative and definitive stamps have been issued.
