# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Kyrgyzstan

Nearly 20 years ago the Berlin wall fell, and over the next few years the countries of eastern Europe slowly moved from communism to free elections.  After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union agreed to give up its monopoly of power in February 1990, Lithuania delcared reindependence in March, followed by Estonia and Latvia later in the summer.  Although the Soviet authorities attemped to suppress nationalism the government recognised the independence of the Baltic states on 6 September 1991 the Gorbachev government continued to aim for an economic union of the remaining states.  However, Russian president Yeltsin decided to disband the USSR in accordance with the Treaty of the Union of 1922 and thereby remove Gorbachev and the Soviet government from power.

In December 1991 the Ukrainian referendum voted for independence and following this the leaders of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine declared the Soviet Union dissolved, replacing it with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).   There were doubts over the validity of moves to effect the dissolution of the Soviet Union, since they were signed by only five of the Soviet Republics. However, on December 21, 1991, representatives of all member republics except Georgia signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, in which they confirmed the dissolution of the Union. That same day, all former-Soviet republics agreed to join the CIS, with the exception of the three Baltic States.  By December 31, 1991, all official Soviet institutions had ceased operations as individual republics assumed the central government's role.

After the break-up of the Soviet Union 15 independent republics were re-established or were newly created.  We lsit then in alphabetical order and the links can take you to the individual country articles.
