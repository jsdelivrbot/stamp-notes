\chapter{1895-1899}    

The dual British and Z.A.R. control did not work very well and further negotiations took place between Pesident
Kruger and the British High Commissioner which resulted in yet another Convention which gave Z.A. R. sole rights and powers of jurisdiction, protection and administration over Swaziland without incorporation. This
protection of Z.A.R. came into force on February, 1895.

From a postal point of view Swaziland became an integral part of the Z.A.R. and from the date
just mentioned \textit{un-overprinted} Z.A.R. stamps became current, although the overprinted stamps
remained valid for use up till November 7, 1895.

Usage of Z.A.R. stamps during t his stage is, of course, only recognizable by postmarks. Known postmarks
are "BREMESDORF/SWAZIEL" and "DARKTON/SWAZIEL" and the double 
circle "DARKTON/Z.A.R." There are also the Squared circle of "EMBABAAN" (orginal spelling of Mbabane) and the double circles of "EMBABAAN/Z.A.R." and "BREMESDORP/Z.A.R." One can also find the Cape of Good Hope numerals 628 and 718.
