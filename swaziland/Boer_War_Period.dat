\chapter{Boer War Period}   
When the Anglo-Boer War broke out Swaziland was left without postal services and, indeed without 
an organized government. The Z.A.R. officials left on, or soon after the outbreak of war in October 1899, and no administration under British auspices was set up until some time after the end of the war in May 1902. 

The headquarters of the new administration were established at Mbabane; the former capital Bremerdorp,
having largely destroyed during the war.
