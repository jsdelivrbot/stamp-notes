## Swaziland
Swaziland is one of those countries that are not very popular with collectors---even in South Africa. A small landlocked country in Southern Africa did not produce any exciting philatelic items, and is of interest mostly to Transvaal collectors, itself being a diminishing group.

Geographically Swaziland is a small country, being only about the size of Wales. As the notable philatelist Pirie wrote in 1949 \cite{Pirie, 1949} : it is also small if one merely collects its stamps according to catalogue, but to get together a representation of all stages of its postal history is a bigger task. 

The first white settlers moved into Swaziland by obtaining mining rights or grazing concessions. The first of these were granted by King Mswazi in 1860. In 1876 King Mbandeni confirmed various concessions granted, mainly to citizens of the South African Republic (Z.A.R.); these amounted to making the territory a Z.A.R. Protectorate.
The convention of Pretoria held in 1881, howver expressely stipulate the independence of Swaziland, and this 
was re-affirmed in the Convention of London held in 1884.

As the Swazi King continued granting concessions and the settlers clamoured for better security for their rights. The King became larmed and appealed to the British Government for Imperial Protection. This was refused, so he thereupon asked that a son of Sir Theophilus Shepstone, Jnr., was appointed in March 1887.

One of the first tasks of Shepstone was to form a "White Committee" of 15 members---5 concessionaires, 5 rsidents and storekeepers, and 5 holders of grazing rights, which Committe functioned till the death of King Mbandeni in October 1889.

\section{1887-1889}

One of the first actions of the White Committe was to request Mr. Shepstone to communicate with the Z.A.R. Government with regard to a postal service. On July 7, 1887, Mr. Shepstone reported to the Committee that "No extended postal service has yet been organized but in the emantime there is a weekly service to steynsdorp (in the Z.A.R. close to the Swaziland border)" and a fortnightly one to Delagoa Bay."

A bag was made at the Swazi Government offices in Embekelweni (situated a few miles from bredersdorp) and sent by runner to Steynsdorp where the letters were stamped with Z.A.R. postage stamps, the stamps being paid with a deposit kept there. private individuals were allowed to use teh Government bag, paying cash at Embekelweni for the
postage due on tehir packets. One known cover an official envelope "On the Swazi King's Service" is known with a Steynsdorp postmark being SP-11-88. At this time in the southern part of Swaziland thee were few letter writers, almost the only white inhabitants being a few hunters and one store keeper at Mahamba \cite{Pirie}. This store keeper sent a private mail-bag to Puet Retief at irregular intervals, the letters being stamped there.

\section {1889-1895}

On the death of King Mbandeni there cam into operation what had already been agreed upon between the British Government and the Z.A.R. viz. a joint Protectorate, the independence of Swaziland being again re-affirmed. In this condominium Z.A.R. had the postal cencession rights; A postmaster was appointed who ran a weekly post-cart from Bremersdorp to the Transvaal, and opened several postal agencies in the territory. The stamps used were the current ones of the Z.A.R. overprinted "Swazieland" in black, overprint 13mm long; they were first put on sale  in October 18, 1889.

\section{Later Issues}

The conservative issue of stamps continued in th 1960s and which produced some interesting issues. In 1961 the currency was decimalized in line with the rand in the newly established Republic of South Africa and in later years with Independence the overpinting of the issue.
