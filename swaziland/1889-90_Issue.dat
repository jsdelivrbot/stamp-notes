\chapter{1889-90 Issue}  

The first Swaziland Stamps were overprinted on Z.A.R. current issues of 1d., 2d., and 1/- perforated 12.5 x 12, nd the \halfd., 2d., 6d., 2/6, 5/-, and 10/- perforated 12.5, the 2d. being the only one occuring in both perforation varieties. According to "Africa, Volume. III" were printed 1/2d., 1d., 6d., and 1/-, 30,000 each; 2d., 60,000; 2/6, 4,500; 5/-, 2,100, and 10/-, 300. The overprinting was done on sheets 60, 6 horizontal rows of 10 each.

an outstanding error in the erlier printings, which was later corrected was that of "Swazielan."

The error is recorded in the \halfd., 2d. (both perforation varieties), and the 5/-. 
It is on the first stamp of the bottom row. Pirie expressed the opinion that this was a deliberate error and quotes dr. r. broom of the Transvaal Museum sharing the same opinion.

Inverted overprints are recorded on all denominations except \halfd., 2d., and 5/-, but in the case of the 5/- there is said to have been only one sheet with inverted overprint, so only one 5/- stamp with "Swazielan" inverted can ever existed.

\section{1894 Reprints}


Reprints were printed in July 1894 on the \halfd., 1d., 2d., and 10/- denominations. The overprint was of the same type  as before, but a stop after "Swaziland". There are said\cite{Pirie} to have been 10 sheets of each of the three lower values and 1 sheet of the 10/- so overprinted. Stamp No. 13, the third in the second row, has a fancy initail "S." Some of the stops are round, some of them square, and they may be level with the foo tof the rest of the overprint or slightly raised. The 1/2d. exists with the overprint inverted. Pirie quotes Mr. A. Basden stating that he had been informed on excellent authority that these stamps were actually prepared for use, but they were never issued because of the coming of the next stage of the history of Swaziland. This is perhps a very feasible explanation. The three values exist postmarked "darkton/Swaziel- 1 Aug 94,"
