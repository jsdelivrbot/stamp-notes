\chapter{British Administration}

In August 1902, with the ending of the Anglo-Boer War a British Administration was set up with Mr. F Enraght-Moody at Mbabane as Special Commissioner for the territory to administer Swaziland as a British Protectorate. Mbabane was chosen as the seat of the Government as Bremersdorpt was destroyed during the Boer War, with only four residents remaining. With the new Administration it was decided that the postal services of Swaziland would be operated by the postal administration of the Transvaal Colony. Proud quotes a telegram sent from the postmaster of Barberton to the Special Commissioner on 28 October 1902:-

\begin{quotation}
P.M.G. desires me to inform you a postmaster wil be sent to Embabaab at an early date and begs you be so good as to arrange for temporary office accommodation.
\end{quotation}

The reply on 1 November was:

\begin{quotation}
There is no possible accommodation for proposed postmaster and no food supply available. Stop. I consider it unecessary to appoint postmaster yet as there are no regualr mails services also very few Europeans yet have arrived.
