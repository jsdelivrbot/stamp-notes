\chapter{King George VI Period, Swaziland, 1933 Definitive Issue} 


The 1933 KGV issue of 10 duties (Figure 1), based on a design by the Rev C.C. Tugman, was recess printed
by Messrs Thomas De La Rue & Co Ltd of London. When on 12 April 1937 the Crown Agents invited De
La Rue to tender for:

\begin{blockquote}
"....the new issue of Swaziland stamps which is to be in the design of the existing issue, except that the portrait of HM King George V is to be replaced by an approved portrait of HM King George VI\ldots."
\end{blockquote}

this appeared straightforward enough to let Swaziland have one of the earliest colonial issues of the new reign. However, virtually a year passed before that new stamp issue  went on sale on 1 April 1938.

The Correspondence Books' of the De La Rue archives, at the National Postal Museum in London, chronicle
the tortuous path of achieving the 'approved portrait' (which also affected many other colonial issues) and
design changes resulting from the deletion of 'Protectorate', with the Crown Agents intent on maintaining
their standards.
This article summarises correspondence between De La Rue and the Crown Agents relating initially to
the general evolution of 'approved portraits' of the early King George VI period and then covers the specific
application to and design aspects of the Swaziland issues, including Postal Stationery, with illustrations
covering also some of the proof material known.

\section{Selection of a KG VI Portrait}

Early in 1937 there were discussions between the Crown Agents and De La Rue on the most suitable formats
for portraits. Dated 6 January 1937, a letter from I.E. Aird (a De La Rue director) to the Crown Agents
confirms a telephone conversation and the recommendation that for Surface Printed stamps:

\begin{blockquote}
"....a profile portrait is much to be preferred....for full face portraits there is always the danger that in the finer
points of the eye some of the work may fill in....nevertheless we are prepared to undertake the engraving of a full
face portrait....provided we are able to have plenty of time for the work."
\end{blockquote}

For Cameo Dies (embossed stationery) the recommendation was:

\begin{blockquote}
"....we consider it even more important to have a profile head than for surface printed designs....for full face cameos,
the drawback is the extensive depth in the die that is required to give the necessary relief to the cameo.... there is a
tendency to split the paper in working....could give a peculiar expression if any pressure is exerted on the embossed
copy".
\end{blockquote}

Direct plate (recess) printing was not mentioned, probably because that process is the most versatile and is suitable for any type of portrait.

On 4 February 1937, De La Rue wrote to the Crown Agents:   

"We send herewith the sketch that we have had prepared as a copy for small portrait engravings of His Majesty the
King....(for) designs printed by the direct plate process....The sketch has been prepared from a photograph by
Vandyk which showed the uniform of Admiral of the Fleet....we have not, up to the present, obtained a satisfactory
profile sketch for the surface head....but have in hand two sketches which will be ready in a few days' time".
The Crown Agents expressed some interest; on 11 February 1937, De La Rue wrote:
"Following your telephoned request we send you herewith two further reductions of the portrait....which we have
had prepared...."
On 25 February 1937, the Crown Agents communicated with De La Rue, headed "CONFIDENTIAL'
and denoting reference 'G 349':
" ....the following photographs have been provisionally selected in connection with portraits of His Majesty for use
on permanent issues of Colonial Stamps:

Messrs Bertram Park No. 05260C

" No.03140T

We shall now be glad if you will submit to us for consideration by the Secretary of State artist's designs based upon these two photographs....the reproduction from the former photograph should however, show the King in a uniform collar instead of a white collar".

The Bertram Park Collection2 contains a copy of photograph 03140T and a copy of 05260 with suffix 'K' rather than 'C'; the significance of the suffix is not known but the 05260K is also referred to in Crown Agents' records. These two photographs are reproduced below; note the Bertram Park 'signature' near the bottom edge.

De La Rue duly submitted the required designs on 23 and 24 March 1937; on 24 April 1937 the Crown Agents wrote:


"..../ have to inform you that the three designs showing the King's head looking east, for surface printing, and the
three designs prepared from photograph No. 03l40T,for recess printing, are approved for general use....".

The three designs of each type probably refer to the final size of the impression rather than to variations in the designs.
It was now up to De La Rue to engrave the agreed designs and submit die proofs for approval to the Crown Agents.

\section{The Crown Agents' Order for Stamps}

For the new issue of Swaziland Postage and Revenue stamps, on 12 April 1937 the Crown Agents invited De La Rue to tender as quoted in para. 1, adding:

"....Please state to what extent the existing printing material can be utilised. Your quotation should reach this office
by noon 26th April or earlier, no designs are required. It is assumed that the printing rates for the present issue will
apply to the new issue. Please confirm".
The Form of Tender was for the supply of dies and printing plates only;
"....details of the quantities of stamps required will be furnished later".
De La Rue's quotation was dated 16 April 1937 and amounted to £195.0.0d for the dies and printing
plates for the 10 duties involved, calculated as Blank Original Die @ £15, 10 value dies @ £6 each and 10
printing plates (60 set) @ £12 each. Their covering letter advised:
"....None of the existing printing material can be used but our figures are based on making use of the existing
original to prepare the new original. The printing rates for the present issue will apply to the new issue".
The above reference to the 'existing original' probably relates to the KGV undenominated Master Die,
where De La Rue may have had a way of replacing the portrait only, possibly by means of an insert.

The Crown Agents' order was dated 21 April 1937 and denoted reference G/Swaziland 454/1,
stipulating:

"Proofs in triplicate of all dies to be submitted for approval".

The quantities of stamps required were not specified until 10 August 1937 and were ordered on Req
454/2 as shown in paragraph 6.
Because of shortages in Swaziland, a supply of 5 duties ('/zd, 4d, 6d, I/- and 10/-) of the KGV series
(termed the 'present' issue by the Crown Agents) were printed by De La Rue and shipped on 3 April 1937
against the Crown Agents' Requisition 447/1.
5. Engraving of the approved portrait designs
Following the approval received from the Crown Agents on 24 April 1937, De La Rue's engravers applied
themselves to the task of engraving the approved portrait designs.
On 10 June 1937, De La Rue submitted proofs for the smallest sized three-quarter profile head for recess
printing, and on 24 June 1937 they submitted further proofs:
"Portrait engraving for Recess Printing
We send herewith triplicate copies of proofs in Blue, Red and Green of the larger size portrait
engraving....We also enclose a 1 cent Kenya stamp to show how that engraving would be
incorporated....It was our intention to engrave this head in three sizes of which this is the second one to
be submitted. We do not, however, propose to proceed with the third size until we hear further from you.
Portrait Head for Surface Stamps
We enclose four proofs of the small size surface head....we enclose a photograph of a sketch ofHM The
King which we have recently prepared, in case it may be of interest....for portrait engravings...."
On 6 July 1937, De La Rue wrote to the Crown Agents:
"In accordance with your telephonic request we send herewith a Swaziland stamp incorporating the three-quarter
face portrait engraving ofHM The King. In this specimen the portrait and background are actually printed from the
die itself so that the printed copies would look exactly like this, line for line".

A 'montage' of what this specimen would have looked like is shown in Figure 5, where the head from
the large three-quarter profile proof, thought to 'date' from the 24 June 1937 submission^, has been mounted
on a KGV stamp.

Meanwhile, engraving work proceeded; on 9 July 1937, De La Rue submitted further proofs:
"We enclose some proofs on card, number V216, 217, 221, 222 of the larger size surface head...."
The Crown Agents' opinion of the proofs submitted was contained in their letter dated 10 July 1937 to
De La Rue:

\begin{letter}
"Gentlemen,

With reference to our conversation with Mr Aird on the 9th July, I have to inform you that the die proofs of the small size portrait head for surface stamps enclosed in your letter of the 24th June are not considered satisfactory, and we shall be glad if you will let us have fresh proofs reproducing more accurately the approved* design.

The proofs of the three-quarter profile enclosed with your letter of the 10th June are also not considered
satisfactory. The face appears to be a little too full; there seems to be a swelling of the right lower jaw, and a smudge
on the left-hand side of the portrait, and the left eyebrow slants upwards too much. It is essential that the hair should
not look as though it had been wetted or oiled and as far as possible it should be given the appearance of being
brushed up in front and on the right-hand side of the face as in the two approved profile photographs. It is also
suggested that the shape of the top of the head would be shown more distinctly if the background here was lightened.
As for the larger sized three-quarter profile engraving, of which proofs were enclosed in your letter of the 24th
June, this is considered somewhat more satisfactory, and consideration is being given to its approval. Before a
decision is made, however, please give a list of the stamps upon which it is intended to use it.
The photograph of the sketch of His Majesty also enclosed in your letter of the 24th June is returned herewith.
There is no intention at present to depart from the approved designs in connection with Colonial stamps, but there
would be no objection to your embodying this sketch in any new design you may be asked to submit for other work, eg currency notes.

\closing{I am, Gentlemen,}
\closing{Your obedient servant}
\closing{(signed:) A. Maxwell Hicks}
\closing{for Crown Agents."}
\end{letter}   

The Crown Agents' comments must have rather deflated De La Rue - their response was not forthcoming
until 21 July 1937, consisting of two letters from I.E. Aird. The first is a personal letter to A. Haxwell Hicks
and advises that the writer shall be abroad on business for several weeks, gives an overview of the engraving
position and advises whom to contact at De La Rue's. The second is a formal business letter, which notes:
"Portrait Head for Surface Stamps
....we now send revised duplicate proofs in black and red. From the steel die we prepared a copper electro on which
certain modifications have been carried out and the proofs we now submit are printed from it....
Portrait Engraving for Recess Printings
....on the smaller head submitted (we) are modifying the die....we are also putting in hand a completely new
engraving in this size.
The stamps on which it was intended to use the larger engraving are the following....Gibraltar, Swaziland, Kenya
(Jinja bridge & Stork (sic) designs).... As you did not find this die entirely satisfactory we are preparing another
engraving in this size...."

On 22 July 1937, De La Rue wrote:

"Following our letter of yesterday's date and the subsequent telephone conversation, we now send revised proofs from the copper electro....".

These proofs at last brought some success - on 27 July, the Crown Agents advised De La Rue:

\begin{blockquote}
"I have to inform you that the further revised proof of the (Surface Stamps) die is now approved....".
\end{blockquote}
