\chapter{Introduction}


The British empire in the Indian subcontinent lasted nearly 200 years. Beginning in 1757, all
the areas of present-day India, [Pakistan](../pakistan/Introduction), [Bangladesh](../bangladesh/Introduction) and [Burma](../burma/Introduction) were brought under British
political control by the middle of the nineteenth century. Of this area, “British India” was
defined as “all territories and places within Her Majesty’s dominions which are for the time
being governed by Her Majesty through the Governor-General of India”;1
the remaining areas
were referred to as the “native states” or the “princely states” by the Colonial government
and were ruled by hereditary kings.

I will use the term “native states” throughout the
paper.
About 680 native states were recognized by the Foreign Office in 1910. Native states
constituted about 45% of the total area of British India (excluding Burma and Sind) and
about 23% of the total population in 1911. The map in Figure 1 shows the geographic
distribution of native states. We see that native states were present in all parts of India, with somewhat higher concentrations in the western and central parts of the 
country.


Native states varied considerably in all dimensions. Some consisted of only a few
villages, while the largest native state, Hyderabad, had an area of 98,000 square miles. They
had varying degrees of legal autonomy, from “first class states” having maximum legal powers
(including that of the death penalty over their own subjects, though not over British subjects)
to “third class states” who could only try civil cases involving small sums of money. Native
states also varied considerably with regard to their systems of administration and revenuecollection,
their currency, legal codes, law enforcement and justice systems. Over time, some
states adopted the legal codes and currency prevailing in British India, though the British
usually did not force them to do so but waited instead for “the willing cooperation of the
Native princes.” The majority of rulers were Hindu kings, though there were several Muslim
and Sikh rulers as well.3
