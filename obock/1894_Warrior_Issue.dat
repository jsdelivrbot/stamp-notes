## Obock

\subsection{1894 Warrior Issue}

In the 1890s, Obock and Somali Coast, French colonies in Africa, both issued 
flashy stamps, some of which were diamond shape or  triangular shape. For      
example, the Obock 50-franc Camel and Rider triangle stamp  is shown 
in Figure 2. 

 The fascinating thing about these stamps is that, though imperforate, they have simulated perforations
printed on them around the stamp design. This gave them the then-modern look of perforated stamps at 
no additional production cost, although the utility of those printed perforations was nonexistent.
