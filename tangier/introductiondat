{{wi:Tangier}}  a city of Northern Morocco has a very interesting political and philatelic past. Tangier's geographic location made it a centre for European diplomatic and commercial rivalry in Morocco in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By the opening of the 20th century it had a population of about 40,000, including 20,000 Muslims (with Berbers predominating over Arabs), 10,000 Jews, and 9,000 Europeans (of whom 7,500 were Spanish). The city was increasingly coming under French influence, and it was here in 1905 that Kaiser Wilhelm II triggered an international crisis that almost led to war between his country and France by pronouncing himself in favour of Morocco's continued independence.

In 1912, Morocco was effectively partitioned between France and Spain, the latter occupying the country's far north (called Spanish Morocco) and a part of Moroccan territory in the south, while France declared a protectorate over the remainder. The last Sultan of independent Morocco, Moulay Hafid, was exiled to the Sultanate Palace in the Tangier Kasbah after his forced abdication in favour of his brother Moulay Yusef. Tangier was made an international zone in 1923 under the joint administration of France, Spain, and Britain, joined by Italy in 1928.[5] After a period of effective Spanish control from 1940 to 1945 during World War II, Tangier was reunited with the rest of Morocco following the restoration of full sovereignty in 1956.

The overprint is higher on the 2nd value presumably 
so that it did not cover up the value or the King's 
head whilst keeping the face value visible.

In 1924 an agreement between France, Spain and the UK set up Tangier as an "international zone". Until then the town had used British stamps overprinted "Morocco Agencies" or Spanish currency overprints (along, of course, with issues by the French and Spanish postal agencies for their own offices). However it was not until 1927 that British stamps overprinted "Tangier" were issued, and until 1948 the issues were confined to the lowest values. On 1st April 1957 the GPO issued the full definitive set up to 10s to celebrate jointly the centenary of the opening of the first British post office, and also the closure of the final office at the end of the same month.


__In 1950 the GPO permitted the use in the UK of any overprinted stamps (of any vintage) 
which did not alter the face value. 
Morocco Agencies and Tangier stamps can easily be found with UK postmarks, 
and are fully legitimate items, but sell for much less than those with postmarks from the relevant area.__

__After several years' gradual disentanglement from Spanish and French 
colonial control, Morocco reintegrated the city of Tangier at the signing of the Tangier 
Protocol on October 29, 1956.__

Tangier remains a very popular tourist destination for cruise ships and day visitors from Spain and Gibraltar.
