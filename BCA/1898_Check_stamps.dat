## Nyasaland Protectorate (Formerly known as British Central Africa)

###1898 (Mar.11) Check Stamps
Very little fresh information concerning these interesting stamps has been recorded
since the late Sir Edward Bacon's article appeared in the LONDON PHILATELIST for August,
1914. (Unfortunately this is one of the numbers which is out of print.) Indeed, it is a measure
of the completeness of the article that the Synopsis with which it terminates is still the form
in which the stamps are listed in Gibbons' Catalogue. It will be seen however that this
Synopsis is no longer complete; additional varieties that have come to light are detailed
in the notes which follow. Further, Bacon's article dealt only with the settings and their
varieties whereas it is considered that attention should be directed towards certain aspects
concerning these stamps, their usage and scarcity. In particular it is thought that some
attempt should be made to bring into perspective the status of the unissued varieties.
Referring to the date of issue of the stamps, Bacon quotes a copy postmarked 11 March
1898, coinciding with the date of the postal notice. There is no doubt that this is the date
of issue, for the writer possesses three copies and two others have been noted; all are used
at Zomba on March 11. This is significant, for Lt.-Col. J. R. Danson has a bisected 2d
of the 1897 issue cancelled Tshiromo 11 March 1898.

The stamps appear to have been in general use throughout the Protectorate. One variant
or another has been recorded as used at the following offices:
Zomba, Blantyre, Tshiromo, Fort Johnston, Port Herald, Fort Anderson, Deep Bay,
Upper Shire, Karonga, Kota Kota and Tshikwawa. Notification of use at any office not
included in this list would be appreciated.

These were printed in Blantyre with the one penny checque stamp embossed in the 
centre. Some of them are found with
the initials "J.G." or "J.T.G." the then Acting Postamster General J.T.Gosling. 
The stamps were printed in sheets of 30 stamps 15x2. 

The first setting had the blue portion printed in two operations, the second 
setting in one operation.

The issue can be found both perforated and imperforated.
