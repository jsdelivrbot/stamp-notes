The first issue of the Protectorate was a provisional issue with B.C.A. overprinted on Rhodesian stamps.
These were printed on unwatermarked paper and are perforation 14. (The papermaker's watermark (William Collins Sons & Co.)
appear once on each sheet; this consists of the initials W.C.S.Co. centrally EXTRA to left, STRONG to right and in convex
and concave curves above PURE LINEN and WOVE BANK below, portions of which appear on some copies.

Each sheet of 60 was printed from a stereo, of which the lower three horizontal rows were duplicates of the upper three

Beware of fakes. The 1891 B.C.A. is found forged on genuine Rhodesian stamps, 
genuinely used or fiscally cancelled and cleaned.
sometimes a spurious postal cancellation is added.

All high values should be purchased with a certificate in order to avoid 
cleaned revenue stamps, fiscal cancellations (offered as
postally used). there are also forgeries where the word SPECIMEN has 
been removed and the scar carefully covered
with a cancellation.
