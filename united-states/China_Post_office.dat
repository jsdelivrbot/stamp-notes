From 1839 to1842 Great Britain and China engaged in a series of skirmishes over the right to sell opium grown in the British colony of India. Britain had developed something of a trade imbalance with China due to the Brit's unquenchable thirst for Chinese tea. The British viewed opium as medicinal, while many Chinese officials viewed it as a dangerous drug.  In the end, Britain's superior naval power and technology prevailed; the aftermath of these "Opium Wars" was a treaty favorable to Great Britain, assigning parcels of five port cities as British enclaves, most notable among these Hong Kong and Shanghai. Other countries requested and were granted somewhatThe 1c/2c Shanghai, China overprint Scott K1 similar arrangements. In 1861 the U.S. was granted the right to build a Consulate at the down-river edge of the city, meaning any boats entering Shanghai from inland China need first pass the settlement that grew up around this "American Concession", greatly increasing America's presence in China.

The American Concession, as did each of the foreign concessions, maintained a sovereign identity including its own army, police force and post office. Established in 1867 at the U.S. Consulate, and run by the American Consul General himself, the postal agency in Shanghai countered the high cost of sending mail through the foreign  postal agencies. The cost of sending a letter to San Francisco via British, French or German mails ranged from 30\cent to 72\cent for the first half-ounce. In 1869, after the trans-continental railroad was completed, mail could be shipped much more quickly from China to Europe by crossing the U.S. by rail than by sea routes; there was no Panama Canal at this time. Time-sensitive documents from many nations found their way to the U.S. mails making Shanghai America's busiest foreign office. In fact, mail from Japan and other Asian ports often made its way to Shanghai before being sent on its way to San Francisco. By 1907, the volume of mail had outgrown the American Consulate and an independent post office was established with John Darrah as Postal Agent.
