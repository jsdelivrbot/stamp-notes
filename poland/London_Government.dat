###Poland's Government-in-Exile Stamps issued in Great Britain 

The collection in this exhibit provides the background and shows the three sets and one 
single stamp issued by the Polish Government-in-Exile, based in London, during World 
War II (specifically during the period between December 1941 and February 1945).   
These stamps were issued after consultations with,  and with the agreement of, British 
Government authorities. 

The stamps were primarily issued for use by Polish naval and merchant marine personnel 
serving with the allied fleet in their fight against Hitler's German armies.  In effect they 
were to be used while the Polish ships were in waters that were considered to be Polish 
sovereign territory.   

The stamps depict scenes associated with Polish armed forces in training or in battle with 
the common enemy whether on land, sea or in the air.  They were, as already mentioned,
part of the  allied armies but specifically under British command, though they also had 
their own Commander-in-Chief, General Wladyslaw Sikorski who, at the time, was also 
Prime Minister with Poland's Government-in-Exile. 

With the agreement of the British Postal authorities, and subject to their oversight, the 
stamps were, on special national occasions, also available to Polish ground forces based 
in Great Britain. They were seen by Polish serving personnel not only as postage stamps
but, more importantly, as patriotic souvenirs,  by  purchasing them they were showing 
support for the Polish Government-in-Exile.  As a result each issue was quickly sold out
and many of the stamps ended up on First Day and Commemorative covers with fewer 
used on genuine postal items.  Because they were issued in relatively small quantities, the 
stamps, whether mint, used or on cover, are now becoming rather rare.

Polish Armed Forces: Their Role in the War against Hitler's German Armies 
A Philatelic Exhibition

The invasion of Poland by Hitler's German forces on 1 September 1939 led to a declaration 
of war on Germany by the British and French Governments and the formation of an allied 
army, joined by Polish infantry units, air force personnel, naval and merchant vessels which 
at that time were on the high seas or subsequently escaped from occupied ports. Polish forces 
came under British command, though they had their own commanding officers and 
Commander-in-Chief, General Wladyslaw Sikorski, who was also the Prime Minister of the 
Polish Government-in-Exile, based in London. 

Under international law, the Polish naval forces were in effect in a Polish territory, the same 
as there were Polish merchant vessels while they were in international waters.  Accordingly, 
the Polish Government-in-Exile arranged, with the agreement of British authorities, for the 
issue of Polish stamps (also known as Sea Post stamps) for correspondence sent from Polish 
naval ships and merchant vessels.  The Government-in-Exile also obtained an agreement for 
the use of these stamps by land-based members of the Polish infantry and air-force units on 
four special occasions during the year. The British authorities insisted on strict conditions for 
the use of these stamps, which in effect meant that mail had to be cancelled and dispatched 
from one of the navy ships in port or one of the merchant vessels on the open seas. 
The display contains all four issues in mint condition and on covers postmarked on navy and 
merchant ships or at field post offices. 

Many of the covers clearly have a philatelic and/or patriotic perspective, as they bear full sets 
of stamps with no regard for the postal tariff that was in force at the time, and also carry first 
day of issue postmarks.

###Warsaw Uprising
The last stamp to be issued was a commemorative for the Warsaw Uprising.
The Warsaw Uprising was an armed struggle during the Second World War by the Polish Home Army to liberate Warsaw from German occupation. It started on August 1, 1944, as part of a nationwide uprising, Operation Tempest. The Polish troops resisted the German-led forces until October 2 (63 days in total). Losses on the Polish side amounted to 18,000 soldiers and over 250,000 civilians killed. Casualties on the German side amounted to over 17,000 soldiers killed. During the urban combat and after the end of hostilities, when German forces acting on Hitler's orders burned the city systematically, an estimated 85% of the city was destroyed.

The Uprising started at a crucial point in the war as the Soviet army approached Warsaw. The Soviet army had reached a point within a few hundred meters across the Vistula River from the city on September 16, but failed to make further headway in the course of the Uprising, leading to accusations that Stalin did not want the Uprising to succeed. It is likely that Stalin ordered his forces to halt right before entering the city so that the Home Army would not succeed. Had the Home Army triumphed, the Polish government-in-exile in London would have increased their political and moral legitimacy to reinstate a government of its own, rather than accept a Soviet regime. By halting the Red Army's advance, Stalin guaranteed the destruction of Polish resistance (which would undoubtedly also have resisted Soviet occupation), that it would be the Soviets who "liberated" Warsaw, and that Soviet influence would prevail over Poland. The Soviet military gave a shortage of fuel as the reason why they could not advance. German and Polish sources disagree.


In December 15, 1941, the Polish Government in Exile in Great Britain inaugurated the "Polish Postal Service" in a limited way. The emission of Polish postage stamps and the service was dictated by the necessities of contacts with Poles still fighting, Polish Nationals in the world and to propagandize the fact that Poland still fights and the Polish Army, Air Force, Navy, and Merchant Marine are still fighting as the fifth world power, although fighting beyond Poland's boundaries. In order that adhesives issued by Polish Government would retain its full monetary values and philatelic recognition, special postal agencies were created on Polish battleships and on the merchant ships sailing the seas under the banner of Poland, thereby giving this philatelic venture a status of postal service operating on Polish soil.

In this manner 38 postal agencies were established; the centrum of this postal network being the "Postal Department" under the authority of the "Ministry of Defense" of the Polish Government.

In compliance with the mandates of the World Postal Convention, the regular and registered correspondence was accepted exclusively on ships of the Merchant Marine at sea, or the regular Polish Naval Forces. The mail franked with the stamps of the Polish Government in Exile was accepted only for delivery in Great Britain and friendly or neutral nations. This mail-prepaid with Polish stamps-was delivered through the regular postal channels.

This humble postal service has established full philatelic recognition for covers and stamp issues by the Polish Government in Exile. These stamp emissions not only gained great popularity among stamp collectors, they also established a financial income for the Ministry of Finance and a great war propaganda.
