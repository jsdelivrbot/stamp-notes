In March 1895 a new set of stamps showing Malagasy Postal Runners was issued. (This issue was surpressed earlier).
These stamps paid postage on overseas letters as far as Durban. As for previous issues these stamps were
affixed at the left hand corner of envelopes.

All values exist imperforate between pairs.
