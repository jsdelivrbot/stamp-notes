\section{Envoys to England and the Hova war of 1883}

In 1882 the French authorities at Nossi-Be were insisting on their claim to a protectorate over adjacent
coast based, they said, on a treaty with former Sakalava chiefs which had never been acknowledged by
either the Hova government or England. In January the Hova government arranged for the hoisting of
their flag on the coast and wished to exact duties on foreign exports and imports. This action was
regarded by the French commandant of Nossi-Be as a great insult and on about 15 June the French
Commodore M le Timbre broke down the flagstaff and took the flags away. Messengers sent by the
Hova Queen with presents to the Sakalavas by way of commanding obedience to the government were
told to quit after the gifts had been seized.
Thereafter a hostile attitude was adopted by the French towards the Malagasy, leading about 22
June to the hoisting of the French flag on the coast opposite Nossi-B6. This action prompted Consul
Pakenham to telegraph London for the immediate presence of a man-of-war at Tamatave to protect
British interests. A further illustration of the tension aroused by the French action was the occasion of a
conference in Paris in October 1882 at which the attitude and language of the French had been so overbearing
as thoroughly to frighten the Hova ambassador. It was reported that the Ambassador, being so
watched, had put on a false beard to go to see M Anthony Tacchi, the secretary and law translator to
the embassy of the Queen of Madagascar.
Meanwhile envoys from the Queen of Madagascar had held discussions in Paris during a visit from
25 to 28 November. They were terminated abruptly after the envoys failed to reach a settlement with the
French who removed the flag from the envoys' hotel. The party, including the Rev W. C. Pickersgill,
arrived in London where they were unable to obtain assistance with presentation of their case to the
French for some guarantee of the independence and security of the Queen's dominion over Madagascar.
At 31 December 1882 there were 1,200 British subjects, including Creoles from Mauritius, resident in
Madagascar, of whom 500 were on the east coast and at Tamatave. On 26 January 1883 the Admiralty
ordered HM ships Osprey in the Red Sea and Dryad at Rangoon to Zanzibar to await orders. Meanwhile
Frenchmen feared for their lives, and in England questions were asked in Parliament about the
safety of British residents.
In the spring of 1883 Rear-Admiral Pierre, after bombarding villages on the west coast and the town
of Majunga on 16 May and driving out 2,000 Hova soldiers, arrived off Tamatave on 31 May. On the
following day he made demands on behalf of the French government, non-compliance by midnight on 9 June to be followed by hostile measures. At this time Mr Pakenham, the British Consul at Tamatave
was critically ill and he died on 22 June. As a consequence Commander Johnstone of the sloop Dryad,
which was by then stationed at Tamatave, took upon himself the post of acting British Consul, removing
consular records to his ship. On 7 June Pierre issued a notice to the effect that French subjects and
foreign consuls would be received in his vessels, otherwise he would not be responsible for their safety.
This caused something like panic in the town and Johnstone landed a guard of nineteen marines to protect
the consulate. Afer the Queen's refusal of the ultimatum Tamatave was bombarded on 10 June by the Fiore and the Forfait starting fires, the worst of which were prevented from spreading by the British guard. Nevertheless Pierre declared that these fires had been started by an incendiary and that since
Johnstone had landed a guard he must be held responsible for the outbreak. On 12 June the French put
ashore a force which acted in a most tyrannical manner, among other activities arresting Mr Shaw, an
agent of the London Missionary Society, on ridiculous charges of having harboured spies and drugged
wine given to French soldiers.
Ultimately after a period of extreme tension Mr Shaw was released when the charges against him were
proved to be baseless and he was paid an indemnity of £1,000 by the French government.
Rear-Admiral Pierre had been ill and died early in September 1883. It was said afterwards that
Pierre's mental condition during this Hova war became obvious soon after the bombardment of
Tamatave and that Johnstone deserved his promotion to Captain having had to deal with a madman.
An envelope sent by Mr G. Doody, a Royal Marine on HMS Dryad, bears a GB 2d value of the
1880-81 issue. The envelope has been endorsed by the writer 'H.M.S. Dryad Madagascar' and has been
initialled by Lieut M. B. Fowke, his commanding officer. The letter was carried to Marseilles where it received the UPU cancellation in red 'UNION/MARSEILLES' applied to loose ship letters while
being assessed for any tax due. This envelope was backstamped at Colchester, in England, whither
it was addressed, on 16 June.

Rev W. C. Pickersgill's complaints to the Foreign Office
The taking of the port of Tamatave by the French was of lasting significance for the British community
in Madagascar. The UPU in Berne had announced on 22 December 1882 the establishment of an
agency of the French Post Office at Tamatave, admission to the Postal Union being at the request of
France. This gave France an advantage by regularising postage rates with the rest of the world for mail
carried by French packets plying between Reunion and Madagascar. As a consequence alternative
arrangements had to be made for British mail to circumvent the French blockade of Tamatave. Among
those working for the London Missionary Society was Pickersgill, appointed as Her Majesty's Vice-
Consul on 23 June 1883. He was keen to help the missionary community and he set about organising
arrangements for more frequent and cheaper mail services.
Examples of the difficulties were set out in a memorandum dated 26 May 1886 sent by Pickersgill to
the Foreign Office in London. He complained on behalf of British residents that, among other points,
the post office in Mauritius charged for mail which was not received at 6d per letter being one-and-a-half
times the rate between England and Mauritius. One of the missionary societies paid, under protest, as
much as £40 for its share of postage.
Payments of this magnitude illustrate the grievance felt by the communities in Madagascar who were
accustomed to arrange for their agent in Mauritius to deposit money with the post office. Out of that
deposit additional postage appears to have been taken indiscriminately to pay for additional stamps
applied to all letters insufficiently prepaid from, say, England whether or not the letters belonged to the
missionaries. The problem was compounded by the postal clerks who found it impossible to distinguish
between the different missions and non-missionaries. The Consular office, therefore, began to account
for residents' postage. My example of this is shown by the blue crayon '4' almost under a Mauritius
'FOUR CENTS' on 16c carmine from Cowan, Livingston, Noble & Livingstone, traders and planters
in Madagascar. The rate of postage between Mauritius and Madagascar for letters sent to the French
Post Office at Tamatave had been reduced from 6d to 4d with effect from 2 June 1884, while letters for
other parts of Madagascar continued to be charged at the old rates. An envelope, backstamped at
Mauritius on 15 July 1884, was therefore posted through Tamatave shortly after the reduction in
postage.
Complaints of delay and loss of mails were the subject of a letter written by Mr W. Greene, the Postmaster
of Mauritius, in which he listed thirteen steamers which had carried mail from Mauritius to
Madagascar during 1884-85, as follows:

1884 1885
15 May HMS Tourmaline 14 Feb Hettie
3 June HMS Poseidon 8 March Isabelle
2 July Countess 30 March Suzanne
14 August Coleridge 13 June Greyhound
18 October HMS Osprey 30 June Florence
24 December Countess 6 August Galatea
21 August Actoea


##British

Prior to 1884 a local postmaster was elected from British residents in {{wi:Antananarivo}}. The postmaster would collect the mail
from the residents nad forward them by runner to Tamatave. At {{wi:Tamatave}}, the postal charges were debited to the British Consulate
by the French post office and the mail was dispatched to the U.K. via Mauritius, Reunion, Zanzibar or Natal.

In 1884 Mr. W. C. Pickersgill, the newly appointed British Vice Consul at Antananarivo, 
organized the British Consular Mail.

A March edition of the Madagascar Times carried a notification that postal franks could be purchased at the Vice-Consulate
in payment for postal services at the scale laid down (letter 2d. for each 15 grammes for 
the runner service charge).

 An interesting point is that the 4 penny stamp was for 1 oz. and is presumed to be because 
 it was for overseas mail.
