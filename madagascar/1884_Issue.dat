\chapter{1884 March Issue}

These stamps were printed in sheets of four by the London Missionary Society press in Antananarivo. The plates were made up of two pairs so any positional variety will appear on half of the stamps. The stamps can be grouped into three sections a) Inscribed "POSTAL PACKET", (b) Inscribed "LETTER" and (c) the provisionals of 1886 with colour changes.

The large type adhesives were normally cancelled in red or blue crayon. Lowe illustrated a type of five horizontal bars.\RLII{364} Numbers from major Catalogues differ considerably in the way they present the stamps and the varieties. Here we follow a system that describes the stamps in the natural order of issuing.

On 23 April 1886 Pickersgill arranged for a notice to be issued to the public setting out postal rates from
Antananarivo for which the several denominations of postal franks were issued (C). The rate for a 15
grammes letter to the UK was 4 1/2d. As there was no 4 1/2d denomination in the 1884 issue, Pickersgill altered
copies of the one shilling value to 4Jd and initialled these 'WCP' in red ink (figure 5). 

So far as I know three
copies survive (Items 12 to 14). I know of no example of the 'one penny on one shilling' provisional denomination
included in the Society's handbook of 1900 (C) and in catalogue listings of these issues. During a period
of considerable activity and postal interest among residents it is curious that there appear to be no surviving
examples of mail leaving Madagascar via the consular offices from March 1884, the issue of the first postal
franks, until October 1 886 save for the July 1 884 envelope which I have already mentioned (Item 9).

As news of the postal franks reached England, people wrote ordering sets of them which meant probably as many copies were saved by stamp collectors as were used for the purpose for which they were designed.

Whether the supply of franks by Pickersgill illustrated his entrepreneurial interests, we can only guess. Survival of copies not bearing one of the consular cachets which alone validated the frank, and the appearance of a range of twelve denominations in such condition in the 'D. R. Hunt' collection when sold in 1956 indicates to me that these incomplete franks came from the Pickersgill family and were not sold for prepayment
of postage. It may be relevant to note that among thirteen copies given by Pickersgill to a friend in May 1891, all but one bore no cachet as the consular seals were still with the consuls\sidenote{Article in The Philatelist on page 46 of Volume 13 published in 1946.}. I have not heard of an example of SG 5a, the 1d magenta of 1884 without handstamp inscribed 'POSTAL PACKET', listed by Gibbons.

This consular post was discontinued around mid-1887 and from what Pickersgill wrote, quoted above,
senders of letters were still able to use the franks for which they had previously paid. There are four surviving
envelopes with postal franks attached. Three of these are on mail addressed to Derby (I believe to a relative of
Pickersgill) and were sold from the Hunt collection (Items 117, 118, and 127). In each case the consular frank
is attached to the envelope by its top margin in the same manner. As none of these franks were originally intended
to travel with the envelope beyond Madagascar and therefore were gummed at a top corner only, questions
arise about these covers. There are no markings which tie the frank to any cover. I have never seen a
frank which shows signs of having been put on an envelope by the whole of its top margin. If a sender had
really wished to try to post a letter bearing a frank all the way to the UK, surely he would stick the whole label
down. Furthermore the 1888 envelope (Item 127) bears the cachet with 'CONSULAR' excised, in conjunction
with which almost by definition one would not expect a consular frank to be used. The Ud frank on this
cover is a normal copy of SG 40a bearing the cachet before excision; also4W was the letter rate to the UK.
While these envelopes are postmarked in 1886, 1887, and 1888 respectively, I consider that the franks were
attached to the envelopes after they reached the addressee to demonstrate the procedure at Antananarivo.

This conclusion has been reached after longer consideration of the factors present than I had made when I
wrote about these items briefly in my paper 'Early Madagascar' (E). The fourth envelope, which I have not
