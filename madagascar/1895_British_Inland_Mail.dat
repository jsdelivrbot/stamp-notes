In January 1895 a new set of stamps was printed by the London Missionary Society in Antananarivo. These
were printed in sheets of 24 stamps in four panes of 3x2, with the upper and lower panes being tete-beche.

These stamps were ususally placed on the left-hand bottom corner, leaving the normal place for affixing the natal stamps,
with which they are normally franked.
