\chapter{Introduction}

In the early 1860s one of the favorite conundrums of the philatelic journals
of the period was "Where is Bergedorf?"
What little information was to
be found in gazeteers and similar works
of reference was of such a conflicting
nature that, but for the tangible evidence
of the postage stamps, one might
be pardoned for doubting its existence !
Even nowadays the student will find
little of note regarding Bergedorf in any
of the standard works of reference and
it is evident that its fame is due entirely
to its postage stamps. And though the
stamps themselves comprise but one
modest issue, which was in use for the
short period of six years, Bergedorf has
managed to attract plenty of notice.
Not only have several admirable articles
appeared in the philatelic press from
time to time, but the legitimacy of some
of its varieties have on more than one
occasion been the cause of heated argument.
The most recent work on the
subject is from the pen of Dr. Georges
Brunei, an excellent translation of
which will be found in volumes X and
XI of the Postage Stamp.

Though early writers on the subject
could find only conflicting statements regarding
the actual whereabouts of this
small territory a writer in the Stamp
Collectors' Magazine for March, 1863,
gives an historical survey of such interest
that we take the liberty of reproducing
his notes in full.

"In 1387, the Semiramis of the North,
wearing already the crowns of Denmark
and Norway, received that of
Sweden. Albert, the deposed and imprisoned
king, was recognized only by
the island of Gottland and the city of
Holmia, the then capital. John of Mecklenberg,
his father-in-law, was besieged
in that city; and the magistrates of
Rostock and Wismar issued an edict, allowing
all pirates and predatory
brigands, who should attack and capture
any sea or land convoy appertaining to
the queen's party, free access to their
ports, and ready means for disposal of
plunder. The numerous predatory bands
of that lawless period, glad of any excuse
for exercising their profession,
plundered the villages, and under the
pretext of revictualling (ravitailler}
Holmia, called themselves Vitalicns, or
victuallers.

"After this war ceased, the Vitaliens,
satisfied with their lucrative calling,
were by no means inclined to resign
it; and the people of Rostock and Wismar,
who had made peace with the
queen, finding it impossible to lay the
fiend they had raised, unified with Hamburg
and the other Hanseatic towns,
in occasional crusades against their former
allies. This desultory hostility continued
some years ; and, in 1410, Hamburg,
Lubeck, and Bremen obtained an
undertaking from the Counts of Oldenburg,
who doubtless had private reasons
satisfactory to themselves in the shape
of tribute-money for their patronage
to withdraw the protection hitherto afforded
the Vitaliens. These latter were
by no means disposed to succumb, and
allied themselves with other brigands,
then known under the designation of
choenapans and filibusters.

"As the cave of Adullam, ages before,
afforded refuge to everyone that
was distressed, or in debt, or discontented,
so, among other strongholds of
the period under notice, did the castle of
Bergedorf, which now makes its appearance
on the scene. This was peculiarly
adapted to the romantic purposes of a
robber's den ; possessing a subterranean
passage leading from its vaults, with an
outlet at a considerable distance in the
forest. Thence the marauders issuing,
set upon and plundered travelling merchants
and others; and, if not satisfied
with the booty obtained from their persons,
blindfolded, and bore them off to
the dungeons of Bergedorf, till they
could procure ransom from their friends.
They were supposed to be privately protected
by Duke Henry of Saxony under
whose jurisdiction their retreat then was
for reasons, most probably pretty
weighty, best known to himself; as he
never exerted his influence to quell the
nuisance, notwithstanding repeated petitions
were addressed him by the authorities
of the surrounding cities.

"At length the Burgomasters of Hamburg
and Lubeck, with two thousand
foot, and eight hundred horse, and a
crowd of volunteer citizens, made a reggular
attack on the town of Bergedorf;
which, yielding after a brief resistance,
was pillaged and burnt. The brigands,
however, retreated to the castle, which
was strong enough to withstand for
some days the arquebuses and cannons of
that time. On the fifth day the besiegers
collected and fired a quantity of
combustibles the stifling smoke of which,
compelling the defenders to retire from
the walls and windows, enabled them to
make an escalade, and the garrison surrendered
on condition of being allowed
to depart with whole skins. In 1430 it
was agreed that the Duke of Saxony
should abandon forever, to the towns of
Lubeck and Hamburg, the castle of Bergedorf, with its appanages; and for more
than four hundred years has it remained
under the joint protection of those
cities, each claiming the alternate nomination
of a bailiff, or governor of senatorial
rank at first appointed for four,
afterwards for six years and supplying
an equal number of soldiers to garrison
the castle."


Hamburg purchased the exclusive ownership
of Bergedorf on August 8th, 1867,
the price paid being 200,000 thalers
about $150,000 in United States currency.
