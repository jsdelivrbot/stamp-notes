In the latter part of 1900, the Marshall
Islands fell into line with the other
German possessions and was supplied
with the set of thirteen stamps of the
"Hohenzollern" type. These correspond
exactly with all the others in denomination
and color, their only distinctive
feature being the name "Marshall-Inseln"
at top.
