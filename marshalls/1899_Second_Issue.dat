# Second Issue

The Second Issue.
In 1899 a new supply of surcharged
stamps comprising all six values of the
German issue of 1889 were sent to the
colony. This overprint was also applied
diagonally upwards from left to right
but the spelling was revised so that the
first word read "Marshall"—the "c"
being omitted. The 3, 5, 24 and 50pf
values were placed on sale at Jaluit on
September 37th, 1899, the other two
values being issued later.
