# 1900 Third Issue

In the latter part of 1900, the Marshall Islands fell into line with the other German possessions and was supplied with the set of thirteen stamps of the \textit{Hohenzollern} type. These correspond exactly with all the others in denomination and color, their only distinctive feature being the name "Marshall-Inseln" at top.
