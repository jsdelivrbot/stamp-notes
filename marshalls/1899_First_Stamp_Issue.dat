# 1889 First Issue


From 1885, the date of the Teutonic
influence in these parts, until 1897, ordinary
German stamps were used, but in
the latter year, the 3, 5, 10 and 20pf
stamps of the German issue of 1889
were overprinted "Marschall-lnseln" diagonally
upwards from left to right for
use in the colony. Whether the two
lower values were ever used or not
seems doubtful. Eight hundred of each
of the 25 and 50pf denominations were
similarly overprinted and sent to the
Postal Union at Berne but these values
were never issued for use in the Marshall
Islands. In addition to the Postal
Union specimens a number were sold
to a Berlin dealer in 1897 and again in
1899 and though possibly some were
sent to the islands to be cancelled they
were never on sale at the Jaluit post
office.

The first German stamps specifically made for the Marshall Islands were standard German Eagle stamps with the overprint Marschall-Inseln. Their origin goes back to the mid 1890s when the German Colonial Advisory Group ('Kolonialrath') exerted pressure on the German government to follow British, French, Spanish and Portuguese examples and to issue special stamps for each of the German colonies and protectorates. The Imperial German Post Service moved in late 1896 or very early in January 1897 to do so. One of the reasons given by the postals service was to clearly identify the origin of the mailed letters if the cancels were smudged, the other was the fact that for postal purposes the colonies were foreign mail and required foreign mail rates.

Several essays and formal issues of Eagle series stamps were produced for the Marshall Islands. Apart from the initial essays can distinguish two plates with an overprint reading "Marschall Inseln" and one with the overprint reading "Marshall Inseln." These are discussed below. 

## Usage

All used copies of the 3pf are rare both on piece as well as covers, even if these covers are philatelically inspired.

As mentioned earlier, some of the stocks sold to a dealer in Berlin were sent to the Marshall Islands to be posted. This are purely of a philatelic nature and when posted they were affixed to mail with denominations exceeding the postage requirements. As these stamps were of limited quantities, they still command hefty premiums.
