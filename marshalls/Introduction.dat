# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Marshall Islands

The standard mail services to and from the
Marshall Islands went through Jaluit, which
had been declared sole port of entry by 28 June
1888 (Knappe 1886a-b; 1887; Sonnenschein
1888). The Imperial German Government opened
a Post Office on Jaluit in March 1889.
Until the outbreak of the Spanish-American
War in 1898 much of the mail went from Jaluit
to the Spanish Garrison on Pohnpei (then
‘Ponape’) and then via Manila to other destinations.
This was severely disrupted during and
immediately after the war (Spennemann 2003).

The first regular steamer connection was established
in 1902 using the Jaluit Gesellschaft
steamer Oceana which connected Jaluit with
Sydney and, in a later development,
HongKong. From 1905 onwards the purposebuilt
steamer Germania carried out a regular
service that ran as follows: Sydney – Ocean I. –
Tarawa – Butaritari – Nauru – Jaluit – Kosrae –
Pohnpei – Chuuk – Saipan – Yap – Palau –
HongKong (and back the same way). The bulk
of the mail was sent via the Jaluit Gesellschaft
steamer, four times a year, however, mail was
also sent to Sydney aboard the Burns Philp
steamers buying up copra in the Marshalls and
Kiribati (Reichskolonialamt 1911).

Apart from the regular issues, the Marshalls saw usage of bisects for a number of times, probably all philatelically inspired.
