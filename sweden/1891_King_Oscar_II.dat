Although surface printing was economical stamps with portraits do not look as good as those printed by the recess method. As the administration intended to extend the range of portrait definitive stamps with a 10 ore at the end of 1884 and later on with a 5 ore stamp there was an outcry as King Oscar II was disatisfied with the stamps bearing his portrait. It was decided that these series of stamps was to be produced using intaglio-printing from copper plates. 

Eventually a more satisfactory design was achieved and the handbook illustrates a set of eight die proofs endorsed 'Godkannes' (approved) over the King's signature in 1890. 

The stamps were perforated on several machines, but mainly on the Lundell machine until 1906, thereafter on a new supplied by C.L. Holm, retaining the same perforation gauge, 13. Some values appeared imperforate in isolated instances fom Stockholm post offices:

Following some imperforate stamps appearing in the 1900 'escape' imperforate stamps were declared invalid for postage.

The paper had the same crown watermark with marginal inscription as the biccoloured numeral stamps which were contemporary. The toning which appears on most values of this series arises from the printing techniques that were employed.

The quantities of stamps printed was so large, that Ernest H Wise remarked that for the 10 \"ore stamp 1 127 237 870 stamps were printed. Both the number's precision as well as the quantity is mind boggling. No doubt this is probably still the most common stamp of Sweden. Despite the astronomical number very few flaws or varieties exist.
