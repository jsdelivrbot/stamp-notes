\chapter{Postage Paid Handstamps}

Many surviving covers of Biafra can be found with a variety of `PAID` handstamps. The Dudley auction had numerous such covers, which we show below. 

\ph[95%]{../biafra/paid-handstamps.jpg}{Paid Handstamps.}

There were three values of the \textsc{paid} handstamps: 2d for the printed-paper rate, 4d for the ordinary-letter rate and a 1/4d for the registered-letter rate. They were made at the Government Printing Department at Enugu and were distributed by the Head Post Office to most post offices. Examples of the 4d are known from a number of offices. The 1/4d is the scarcest and less than ten examples are known. The 2d is also scarce with about 20 examples known.
