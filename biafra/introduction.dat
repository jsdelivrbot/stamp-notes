At it height, Biafra had a population of 14,000,000 people, who were cut 
from the world by the Nigerian army and the physical geography of the region.

The Republic of Biafra was a secessionist state in south-eastern Nigeria which existed from 30 May 1967 to 15 January 1970. The secession was led by the Igbo people following economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions among the various peoples of Nigeria and contributed to the causes for the Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Nigerian-Biafran War. Biafra was recognized by Gabon, Haiti, Cote d'Ivoire, Tanzania and Zambia.

The authorities in Biafra issued banknotes and postage stamps in order to assert their claim to sovereignty. The postage stamps were used mainly on internal mail within the region but also on some external mail sent by air via Libreville in Gabon.[1]

The expatriate community, mainly British, American, French and Dutch, continued to go about their business for some months but by August 1967 virtually all the businessmen
hd left, following the advice the various High Commissioners. Those that had families had their wives and children send away earlier. Representatives of the various churches stayed right through the Civil War and a lot of the mail that survived came via these charity organizations.

Genuninely used stamps and postal history item are scarce, but do come through auctions from time to time. The few genuine items that come onto the market orginated mainly from the same source, the banking industry and the church organizations.

First stamps 

After independence, the Post Office in Biafra continued to use Nigerian stamps until they ran out when a "postage paid" cachet was applied instead until the first stamps were issued.[2]
The first stamps of Biafra were issued on 5 February 1968 and consisted of three values to mark Biafran "independence".[2]

Overprints 

On 1 April 1968 thirteen stamps of Nigeria from the 1965 issue were issued overprinted with the Biafran coat of arms and the words SOVEREIGN BIAFRA.[2] The 1/2d and 1d values from the same 1965 Nigeria series also exist surcharged with new values and overprinted BIAFRA-FRANCE FRIENDSHIP 1968 SOVEREIGN BIAFRA but these stamps are not believed to have been used for postage.

Most of the reasearch for these notes has been based on the Grosvenor Sale, of the Dudley collection. We understand that other material is lurking in collections and Dealers boxes and we would welcome further contributions to expand the notes we provided. Our thanks to the auctioneer for allowing us to use the images. The collection in my opinion was worth much more than the prices realized. The material in the collection is truly difficult to assemble, but this difficulty limits perhaps the number of collectors interested in Biafra.
