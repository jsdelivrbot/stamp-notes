###Land Campaign and Invasion
Amphibious and land operations in the war. (Borderline of 2007)

Having gained control of the sea, Chile sent its army to invade Peru. Bolivia, unable to recover the Litoral province, joined the Peruvian defence of Tarapacá and Tacna. However many Bolivians would abandon their allies in the heat of the battle, demoralizing all concerned.

On 2 November 1879, naval bombardment and amphibious assaults were carried out at the small port of Pisagua and the Junín Cove –some 500 km North of Antofagasta. At Pisagua, several landing waves totalling 2,100 troops attacked beach defenses held by 1,160 Allies and took the town; the landing at Junín was smaller and almost unsuccessful. By the end of the day, General Erasmo Escala and a Chilean army of 10,000 were ashore and moving inland, isolating the province of Tarapacá from the rest of Peru and cutting off General Juan Buendía's 1st Southern Army from reinforcements.

Marching south towards the city of Iquique with 6,000 troops, the Chileans held off a sudden 7,400-strong Allied counterattack at the Battle of San Francisco on 19 November, with high casualties to both sides. The Bolivian force, possessed of weak leadership, withdrew during the battle, forcing the Peruvians to retreat to the city of Tarapacá. Four days later, the Chilean army captured Iquique with little resistance.

Escala sent a detachment of 3,600 soldiers, cavalry and artillery to wipe out the rest of the Peruvian forces, estimated at fewer than 2,000 poorly trained and demoralized men. The Battle of Tarapacá, on 27 November, took place as the Chilean attack found the Peruvian forces in better morale and at almost double the number expected. Led by Colonel Andrés Cáceres, the Peruvian army routed the Chilean expedition, which left behind significant quantities of supplies and ammunition. The Peruvian victory at Tarapacá would have little impact on the war. General Buendía's army, down to 4,000, retreated further north to Arica by 18 December.

A new Chilean expedition left Pisagua and on 24 February 1880 disembarked nearly 12,000 soldiers at Pacocha Bay (near Ilo). Commanded by General Manuel Baquedano, this force isolated the provinces of Tacna and Arica, destroying any practical hope for reinforcements from Peru. On the outskirts of Tacna combatants from the three contending countries met on what would later be known as the Battle of El Alto de la Alianza. Commanding the allied army was Narciso Campero, the Bolivian president. In the subsequent carnage Chilean artillery proved superior, and as a result most of Peru's professional army was destroyed. After the battle Bolivia withdrew completely from the war.

On 7 June, some 4,000 Chilean forces backed by the Navy successfully attacked 
a Peruvian garrison in Arica, which was under the command of Colonel Francisco Bolognesi. 
Chilean forces, directed by Colonel Pedro Lagos, had to run up the 
Morro de Arica (a steep and tall seaside hill) facing 2,000 Peruvian troops.

The assault became known as the {{wi:Battle of Arica}}, which turned out to be one of the 
most tragic and, at the same time, most emblematic events of 
the war: Chile suffered 479 mortal casualties, while almost 900 Peruvians lost their lives, 
including Colonel Bolognesi. 
This battle was especially bloody since most Chileans died 
because of landmines; and with bullets running low most of the Peruvian 
deaths were at the hands of Corvo-wielding Chileans. 
The multiple cuts on the corpses made many speculate that the execution 
of prisoners had taken place, but most authors say that the captains 
were actually holding back the enraged Chileans to prevent the deaths of routed soldiers.[9]

Other high ranking Peruvian officers who also perished were Colonel Alfonso 
Ugarte, Colonel Mariano Bustamante and his Chief of Detail. 
These three Peruvian officers belonged to the group that, 
on the eve of battle, had gallantly rejected an offer to deliver 
the doomed garrison to the Chileans in an honourable surrender; 
Colonel Bolognesi bore out his famous vow to the Chilean emissary that he would defend Arica 
"to the last cartridge." Bolognesi vow goes as: "Tengo deberes sagrados que cumplir y los cumpliré 
hasta quemar el último cartucho." ("I have sacred duties to fulfill, and I will fulfill them until 
I fire the last round"). The expression "hasta quemar el último cartucho" 
("Until the last round is fired") has passed into the Spanish language.
Chilean charge during the Battle of San Juan

Since the Morro de Arica was the last bulwark of defence for the allied troops standing in the city, its occupation by Chile has been of utmost historical relevance for both countries.

In October 1880, the United States unsuccessfully mediated in the conflict aboard USS Lackawanna at Arica Bay, attempting to end the war through diplomacy. Representatives from Chile, Peru, and Bolivia met to discuss the territorial disputes; yet both Peru and Bolivia rejected the loss of their territories to Chile and abandoned the conference.

19 November 1880 the Chilean army landed in Pisco, and by January 1881, the Chileans were marching towards the Peruvian capital, Lima.

Regular Peruvian forces together with poorly armed people, set up to defend Lima. However, Peruvian forces were defeated in the battles of San Juan and Miraflores, and Lima fell in January 1881 to the forces of General Baquedano. The southern suburbs of Lima, including the upscale beach area of Chorrillos, were looted and every inhabitant was forced to surrender valuables or suffer a bitter end. This desperate order was issued to raise money to pay the late wages of the Chilean soldiers and prevent an uprising.

The outlying haciendas were burned down by Chinese coolies who had been brought in from southern China since the early 1850s as cheap labour for the haciendas.
