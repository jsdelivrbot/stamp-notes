The War of the Pacific, occurring from 1879-1883, is sometimes referred to as the Saltpeter War in reference to its original cause, a conflict that involved Chile and the joint forces of Bolivia and Peru. The conflict stemmed from the control of territory that contained substantial mineral-rich deposits. It led to the Chilean annexation of the Peruvian provinces of Tarapacá 
and Arica and the Bolivian province of Litoral, 
leaving Bolivia as a landlocked country.

19 November 1880 the Chilean army landed in Pisco, and by January 1881, the Chileans were marching towards the Peruvian capital, Lima.

Regular Peruvian forces together with poorly armed people, set up to defend Lima. However, Peruvian forces were defeated in the battles of San Juan and Miraflores, and Lima fell in January 1881 to the forces of General Baquedano. The southern suburbs of Lima, including the upscale beach area of Chorrillos, were looted and every inhabitant was forced to surrender valuables or suffer a bitter end. This desperate order was issued to raise money to pay the late wages of the Chilean soldiers and prevent an uprising.

The outlying haciendas were burned down by Chinese coolies who had been brought in from southern China since the early 1850s as cheap labour for the haciendas.

With little effective Peruvian central government 
remaining, Chile pursued an ambitious campaign throughout Peru, 
especially along the coast and in the central Sierra, 
penetrating as far north as Cajamarca. Even in these circumstances, 
Chile was not able to completely subjugate Peru.
During the occupation of Lima, Chilean troops pillaged Peruvian public buildings, 
turned the old University of San Marcos into a barracks, 
raided medical schools and other institutions of education, 
and stole a series of monuments and artwork that had adorned the city.
As war booty, Chile confiscated the contents of the Peruvian National Library in Lima 
and transported thousands of books (including many centuries-old original Spanish, 
Peruvian and Colonial volumes) to Santiago de Chile, 
along with much capital stock. 
These books were partially returned (4000 of 30,000) to the Peru in November of 2007.

Peruvian resistance continued for three more years, with apparent U.S. encouragement. 
The leader of the resistance was General 
Andrés Cáceres (nicknamed the Warlock of the Andes), who would later be elected president of Peru. 
Under his intelligent leadership, Peruvian militia forces inflicted painful defeats 
upon the Chilean army in the battles of Pucara, Marcavalle and Concepcion. 
However, after a substantial defeat Battle of Huamachuco, there was little further resistance. 

__Finally, on 20 October 1883, Peru and Chile signed the Treaty of Ancón, by which Peru's Tarapacá province was ceded to the victor; on its part, Bolivia was forced to cede Antofagasta.__
