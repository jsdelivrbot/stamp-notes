# 1857 Perkins Bacon Print

Perhaps the best assembly of all Peru stamps was formed by Arthur Linz in the 1940’s. This collection was then sold by private treaty to Bernard Peyton, who eventualy donated it to
the Smithsonian’s National Postal Museum. The collection was described in theLondon Philatelist and from where the images of the essays are taken.

The collection contains all six essays prepared by Perkins, Bacon & Co. for the PSNC.
The first two essays were presented to the company on August 19, 1847 and show a
female figure representing Commerce. The other four are similar to the final adopted design.

These were rejected by the PSNC and Perkins, Bacon & Co. was requested to prepare
essays featuring a steamship in the vignette. The PSNC furnished a print of one of their
ships for this purpose. Four new essays were submitted on August 28, 1847 and the final
stamp design was approved on September 11, 1847.

Die proofs were delivered to the PSNC by letter on September 25, 1847. Although there
is no census, die proofs are uncommon and likely only 5 to 8 copies of each value are
known. All recorded die proofs are in black ink and have been considerably cut down.

They exist on both India paper, wove paper and on card. The Simthsonian collection has a die proof of the 1 real on India paper, measuring 72.5 x 70 mm and is likely the largest proof still in existence (See figure \ref{smithsonian}). Figure~\ref{alemane}, shows a proof from the Corinphila Luis Alemane sale.


One plate of 160 subjects was created for each value. The actual plates survive and are
now in the possession of the Royal Philatelic Society, London.
 
Plate proofs on card are
known in red-brown, black and blue for each value. It is believed that only one sheet of
each value was produced in each of the three colors for a total of 960 plate proofs. They
are seldom seen in the philatelic market and are almost as scarce as the die proofs. One
reason is that the Peyton collection contains a total of 268 plate proofs or 28% of all such
possible proofs. It is also possible that portions of the plate proof sheets were damaged in
a fire at the Perkins, Bacon & Co. warehouse on March 11, 1857. It is known that this
fire destroyed most of the printed stamps that had not yet been delivered to the PSNC, but
there is no actual record of the extent of damage to the plate proofs.

The collection has 44 examples of the 1 real in red-brown including two blocks of 10
each. There are 36 examples in blue including a block of 8 and 49 examples in black
including 3 blocks of 8 each. Of the 2 reales, there are 58 examples in red-brown
including a block of 30, 36 examples in blue including a block of 20 and 45 examples in
black including a block of 24. The plate position of each example is notated on the
album pages. There is no documented plating study for this issue and one must assume
that this information came from whoever divided up the proof sheets.

The 2r stamps are as difficult to find used as the 1r and blocks are also seldom seen.
