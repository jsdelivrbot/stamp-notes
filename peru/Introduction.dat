## Peru 1866-67 Stamps and Postal History


THE first stamps issued by order of the Government of Peru were
those issued on the ist March, 1858, and consisted of :

The one dinero blue

The one peseta dull red

Medio peso yellow and the

Medio peso dull red (error)

all lithographed by Emilio Prugue at Lima, the earliest dates of used copies found
so far being:

1 dinero blue 2oth April, 1858.

1 peseta rose I3th March, 1858.
 
 peso dull rose (error) I3th March, 1858.
 
1 peso yellow i4th March, 1858.

Dealing first with the 1 dinero blue, the stamps were printed from settings of
20 arranged in four horizontal rows of 5 each. There are, however, only 19
distinct types, one space—the first on the left of the 4th row (No. 16)—being
filled up by one of the 19 varieties repeated a second time in the group of
20. So far eleven different types are known to occupy the position of the
missing No. 16, viz.: 2+17, 4+17, 5+17, 6+17, 7+17, 9+17, 10+17,
12+17, 13+17. 15+17 and 18+17.

Hall writes: I have, for the last thirty years, been trying to ascertain the size and shape of
the entire sheet of the un dinero with little success. I do not propose to bother
you with all the plating guides so far ascertained, but whilst we have made a
distinct advance on the knowledge contained in Mr. L. L. R. Hausburg's paper
published in the London Philatelist for May 1917, we are still very much in the dark
and I am bound to say I feel disappointed with the small result achieved. I am
afraid there is very little in the nature of positive results, but am inclined to think
now there were two stones of 200 each. Unfortunately these stamps have such
large margins that it is almost impossible to identify marginal copies and I am
afraid the reconstruction of the entire setting is a hopeless task.

A recent purchase, however, enables us to construct a solid block of 120, so
that the old theory of sheets of 100 in this value is at any rate definitely set
aside.

I have some 1700 copies of the un dinero in my collection, and have worked
on many hundreds of other copies in addition. The number of Transfer flaws
found or noted is extremely small considering the conditions under which these
stamps were printed so far away as Peru and as far back as the year 1858. So far
I have found only three minor Transfer flaws on Types 5, 18, and 20. On
No. 5 the outer line is bent in, above the letters " os " of " CORREOS " on the

right and the " o " of " CORREOS " is squeezed. On No. 18 the " N " of
" DINERO " is thinned and the line below squeezed upwards, whilst on No. 20 the
right-hand lower corner is bent out of shape.
One of the outstanding and most important of the problems yet to be solved
in the early issues of Peru is the fixing of the positions of the errors of colour of
the medio peso on the sheet of the i peseta of 1858.
The Philatelic Rosetta stone in this instance proved to be the horizontal
strip of 10 medio peso yellow in my collection which I have the pleasure of showing
you here to-nighr. To the best of my knowledge it is unique. An examination
shows that it is made up of 5 transfers of the medio peso yellow, I, 2, 3, 4, 5. In
the case of the medio peso yellow the strip of 5 transfers was repeated so as to
make a horizontal row of 10 stamps. The description of the 5 types is as
follows :
(«) A coloured spot below the lower right corner.
(b) The right vertical frame-line projects slightly below the lower frame-line.
There is a small coloured spot in the lower margin below the " RE " of
" CORREOS."
(c) There is a faint white line cutting the lines of shading and the frame-line
below the second " R " of " CORREOS."
(d) There is a coloured spot on the inside of the lower frame-line below and to
the right of the " E " of " CORREOS."
(e) This has no marked peculiarity.
The same five types were repeated down the sheet so that all the vertical rows
were the same type. You will see the two vertical pairs in my collection, which
bear this out, whilst I have seen many large strips of 4 and 5 stamps in vertical
rows which were invariably of the same type.
It is highly probable that the sheet of the i peseta contained 100 stamps
in ten rows of 10 and these were set up in ten blocks of 10 transfers to make up the
sheet of 100. There is a wide margin horizontally between the two rows of 5
transfers making up the block of 10, but the blocks of 10 transfers were set close
together, so that there is only a narrow horizontal margin between the blocks.
The ten types of the one peseta are as follows :

1. The left vertical frame-line projects slightly above the upper horizontal
frame-line.

2. The left vertical frame-line projects slightly below the lower horizontal
frame-line.

3. There is a break in the line of shading above the " s " of " CORREOS " on
the left-hand side of the stamp.

4. There is a break in the inner-frame line below the " EO " of " CORREOS,"
on the right-hand side of the stamp.

5. There is a thickening of the upper horizontal frame-line, for about i mm.,
at the upper left corner.

6. There is a break in the right limb of the " A " of " PESETA " at the junction
with the cross-bar.

7. Both the upper and lower left corners of this type are rounded off. There
 is a cut in the vertical line of shading next to the inner frame-line on the
left-hand side of the stamp stamp, below and midway between the full stop and
the " s " of " CORREOS."

8. The left vertical frame-line is slightly bent inwards and thinned near the
top.

9. The upper left and lower right corners of this type are rounded off. The
left vertical frame-line is thickened towards the top.

10. This type has no distinguishing line of importance, but there is
usually a faint coloured dash on the margin below the bottom frameline
about i mm. from the lower right-hand corner.

In all probability a row of the five transfers of the medio peso error was
substituted for the bottom row of a block of the I peseta. The row of five transfers
of the medio peso could not have occurred on the top or bottom of the sheet.
Adopting Hausburg's numbering of the transfers of the i peseta, a normal
block of the ten types would be
