# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Peru

Peru declared independence from Spain in 1821 and decisively defeated colonial forces at the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824.[1]

Peru began using lithographed stamps in 1857 that initially were provided by the Pacific Steam Navigation Company. Most copies of Peru's PSNC stamps in circulation are forgeries.

So called Trencito, a commemorative stamp from 1871, one of the first in the world. Note the embossing at the center of the stamp on the coat of arms and on the train itself. It was produced in Lima on a "Lecoq" machine of French manufacture.

Around 1860 Peru acquired a French-made device (the so-called "Lecoq" press) that was used to print, emboss and cut imperforate stamps from paper strips. The commemorative stamp illustrated to the right was one of the last Peru produced on this rare machine.
For a catalogue used by collectors to classify early Peruvian (imperforate) stamps by their cancellations, see Lamy (and Rinck).

Prior to World War II, the preeminent collection of Peru was formed by
Thomas William Hall, who was president of The Royal Philatelic Society of
London from 1923 to 1929 and the recognized authority on a number of
lithographed issues of South American countriespreeminent collection of Peru was formed by

Thomas William Hall, who was president of The Royal Philatelic Society of
London from 1923 to 1929 and the recognized authority on a number of
lithographed issues of South American countries.

After World War II, that distinction passed to Dr. A. J. E. Magonette of
Belgium, whose collection was sold in 1957 by the Swiss firm of Corinphila. At
that time Dr. Joseph Schatzkes seriously collected Peru, and Paul Morgoulis, a
major European dealer, purchased most of the Magonette collection at the
auction. These purchases became the foundation of the Schatzkes collection,
which was the finest holding of Peru throughout the 1960’s and won international
Gold medals in the days when judging standards were more rigorous.

In 1971 Paul Morgoulis and Robert Lyman broke up the Schatzkes collection
into individual items and remainder lots for private sale. Islander had first pick
from the entire Schatzkes Peru collection and purchased most of the majorß pieces
of the early issues. This became the foundation of the Islander collection of Peru.
The rest of the Schatzkes collection was offered to a second party, then a third
party, and this part of the Schatzkes collection became the basis of the Peru collections
formed from 1971 up to the present. However, none of the collectors active
during the past four decades has had an opportunity to acquire the major pieces
of Peru, which have been in the Islander collection since 1971.

With the exception of occasional covers or pieces from the Consul Weinberger
collection, which have been discovered in various safe deposit boxes, hidden away
since before World War II, there has been very little fresh classic imperforate
Peru material to work with. The majority of the Islander lots have not been on
the open market since Schatzkes obtained them in 1957.
