\chapter{1858 Issue}

Prior to World War II, the preeminent collection of Peru was formed by
Thomas William Hall, who was president of The Royal Philatelic Society of
London from 1923 to 1929 and the recognized authority on a number of
lithographed issues of South American countries.

After World War II, that distinction passed to Dr. A. J. E. Magonette of
Belgium, whose collection was sold in 1957 by the Swiss firm of Corinphila. At
that time Dr. Joseph Schatzkes seriously collected Peru, and Paul Morgoulis, a
major European dealer, purchased most of the Magonette collection at the
auction. These purchases became the foundation of the Schatzkes collection, which was the finest holding of Peru throughout the 1960’s and won international Gold medals in the days when judging standards were more rigorous.

EXTREMELY FINE APPEARANCE. THIS IS THE LARGEST RECORDED MULTIPLE OF THE ENTIRE PERU 1858 ISSUE. IT WAS THE FRONTISPIECE OF THE COLONEL JOHN F. RIDER COLLECTION SOLD BY ROBSON LOWE IN 1978 AND IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ITEMS OF PERUVIAN PHILATELY.

The 1858 One-dinero lithographic stone was made from multiple transfers of the 20-unit bloc report. The bloc report contained 19 different transfers. Position 16 was either blank on the original bloc report or the transfers on the printing stone were erased and replaced with different types from the bloc report. In this block we have parts of four different transfers of the bloc report. Type 10 was used to fill in Position 16 (top row, fifth stamp from left).

In 1971 Paul Morgoulis and Robert Lyman broke up the Schatzkes collection
into individual items and remainder lots for private sale. Islander had first pick
from the entire Schatzkes Peru collection and purchased most of the major pieces
of the early issues. This became the foundation of the Islander collection of Peru.
