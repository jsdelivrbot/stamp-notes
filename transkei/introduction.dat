# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Transkei

 In South Africa, territories of Transkei, [Bophutatswana](../bophutatswana/Introduction), [Venda](../venda/Introduction), and [Ciskei](../ciskei/Introduction) (the so-called TBVC states) were declared independent in late 1970's and early 1980's. This declaration was however not recognized outside of Soutn Africa. At the same time, South Africa began issuing stamps inscribed with the names of these areas.
 
The South African government set up the area as one of the two homelands for Xhosa-speaking people in Cape Province, the other being Ciskei; it was given nominal autonomy in 1963. Although the first election was contested and won by the Democratic Party, whose founder Chief Victor Poto was opposed to the notion of Bantustan independence,[3] the government was formed by the Transkei National Independence Party. Of the 109 members in the regional parliament, only 45 were elected; the remaining seats held by ex officio chiefs.[4]
The entity became a nominally independent state in 1976 with its capital at Umtata (now Mthatha), although it was recognised only by South Africa and later by the other nominally independent republics within the TBVC-system. Chief Kaiser Daliwonga Matanzima was Transkei's Prime Minister until 1979, when he assumed the office of President, a position he held until 1986.
 
Though these stamps were not officially recognized by most postal authorities, they were generally accepted on international mail. As such, they also appear in all major stamp catalogs with the stamps of South Africa.

When homeland system was terminated in 1994, each state had issued roughly 
300 different stamps. AFAIK, there are no huge rarities with these stamps 
and they are somewhat easy to find (especially in mint condition).  Many of the stamps are well printed and depict scenes and themes prevalent to the area, where others were clearly issued for the philatelic market, which was booming at its inception. Large quantities of stamps survived and are all inexpensive. Commercial mail, can be found but not in large quantities.
