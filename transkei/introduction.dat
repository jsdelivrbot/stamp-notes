\section{Stamps and Postal History of Transkei}

 In South Africa, territories of Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei (the so-called TBVC states) were declared independent in late 1970's and early 1980's. This declaration was however not recognized outside of South Africa. At the same time, South Africa began issuing stamps inscribed with the names of these areas.
Though these stamps were not officially recognized by most postal authorities, they were generally accepted on international mail. As such, they also appear in all major stamp catalogs with the stamps of South Africa.

When homeland system was terminated in 1994, each state had issued roughly 
300 different stamps. AFAIK, there are no huge rarities with these stamps 
and they are somewhat easy to find (especially in mint condition).
