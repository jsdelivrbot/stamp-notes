\section{Provisional "1 Atts" on 64 Atts, 1894}

In 1894 and the following year several varieties of overprinted
1att and 2att stamps were issued. The first of
these was overprinted on the 64 atts lilac and brown, with
the words Atts in the plural, although prefixed by the
numeral 1. But for the fact that the type is different, one
might have assumed that the setting for some other stamp
had been used with only the numerals changed. But the
surcharge is entirely different from previous ones ; the initial
letter is a capital A instead of a small one, and the Siamese
surcharges were set up with the English ones, in sheets of 120,
and printed both at the same time, instead of being done
singly by hand. The English numeral is generally a good
distance from the word "Atts."

Minor Varieties of " i Atts " on 64 Atts.
Owing to its peculiarity of spelling this stamp is readily
distinguished.

\ph[98%]{../thailand/s234148.jpg}{}
Mr. Holland lists (a) " s " of " atts " inverted ; (b) period
inverted ; (c) surcharge inverted ; (d) different space between
" I " and " A " of 'Atts."

Mr. Poole gives seven variations in the length of the surcharge,
viz.:—I, i6Jmm. ; 2,16mm.; 3, ismm. ; 4,15mm.;
5, i4mm. ; 6, 14mm.; and 7, i3 mm. He also gives two
variations in the distance between the Siamese and the
English super-inscriptions, viz. i, gmm. ; 3, lojmm. Also
wrong fount fifth native character ; fourth and fifth native
characters close together ; and a wide space between the fifth
and sixth native characters.

\section{The "I Att" (Large Type) on 64 Atts, 1894}

The next stamp to be noted is practically the same as the
last, with large numeral and letters, but with the superfluous
"s" oft atts" deleted.

Errors and Minor Varieties.
Mr. Holland gives five varieties : (a) English surcharge
double; (b) different space between "i" and "A" of "Atts" ,
(c) narrow "A"; (d) inverted "V" for "A"; (e) period inverted.
The explanation of variety (a) is doubtful, for
it is difficult to understand, as the Siamese and English
inscriptions were printed together, how one could be printed
twice without the other. It is probable, perhaps, the letters
of the English inscription were loose in this instance and
slipped, causing a blurred or partly duplicated impression.
Mr. Poole, in his minute study of these stamps, again gives
seven varieties in the length of the inscription, which go to
prove they were printed from the same setting of type as the
last described stamp, except for the correcting of the final
"s." The variations are 1, i4mm. : 2, 14mm.; 3, isJmm.
;
4, 13mm.; 5, izimm.; 6, 12mm.; 7, iimm.

The different spaces between the English and Siamese
characters are as before, viz. : i, gmm. ; 2, lo^mm.
Mr. Poole also gives a variety with wider space between
the fourth and fifth Siamese characters.
The " Monthly Journal " records a variety of this stamp
with an inverted capital S after the period at the end of the
English inscription thus : " Att.S "

\section{1 Att (Small Type) on 64 Atts, 1894.}

The next stamp is also the same 64 atts stamp, but overprinted
I Att in smaller type, and the Siamese characters are
more uniform. There are two distinct settings of this stamp,
on one of which the surcharge measures 8mm. and on the
other gjmm. Mr. Poole is of opinion, on account of the
regularity and careful execution of these overprints, that they
were done in London, by Messrs. De la Rue & Co., but as
this firm, no doubt, had the plate of the ordinary unsurcharged
stamp of I Att green, it seems scarcely likely that they would
be called upon to overprint stamps of a higher value (and
bi-coloured ones at that) in this fashion, when a single
printing in one colour, green, from the plate of the " i
Att " value would have Supplied the deficiency in these
stamps.

Minor Varieties.

Mr. Holland gives six varieties of this stamp : (a) diiferent
space between " i " and " A " of " Atts "
; (b) inverted " V "
for " A "
; (c) Siamese surcharge omitted ; (d) surcharged on
back as well as on front ; (e) surcharge on back inverted ;
(f) surcharges on back tete bsche. Variety (a) is accounted for
by the two settings with different measurements ; variety (6)
is probably due to a broken or unequally inked A, the cross
bar of which has not left any impression ; variety (e) is
probably due to bad registering of the overprint, as also may
be Mr. Poole's variety with the Siamese surcharge above
" I Att " instead of below it. The latter authority also
chronicles a double surcharge of the mm, setting.
