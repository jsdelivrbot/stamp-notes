\section{The Inland Service}

\subsection{Official Service} 

The inland mail service of the Thai Government in its state up to 
the middle of the 19th century must be looked at as beginning with the 
administrative reforms carried out by Kmulok, (1448-1488) (1), 
who established five civil ministries.  One of those particularly cared for 
the transportation of government letters. 

A description of the organisation o£ the official inland mail was given 
in 1925  the Ministry of Communications states as follows:

\begin{quotation}
"Prior to the establishment; of Post and Telegraph services in 
the Kingdom of Siam, epistolary correspondence was couveyed by 
various methods in accordance with old usage. 

"For the inland service tho transmission of official letters was 
arranged under two categoris:--- \textit{viz}, ordinary and urgent.

"An ordinary message was fowarded from one provinoe to 
another. 

''An urgent messaage was conveyed by special courier. The 
courier was provided with means of oonveyance through whatever 
province he had to go. 

"Alterations and improvements in the above practice were 
made at the time when H. R. H. Prince Damrong became Minister of 
the Interior. Each important town was provided with regular  
couriers, whose duties were to despatch messages from town to town 
and to entrust same to fresh couriers, 

For instance, in case of an urgent message intended for Nagor 
Rajasima, the Bangkok courier had to convey it only to Saraburi. 
After handing the message to a fresh courier at that place his duties 
ended. The successive couriers took charge of the message and 
carried it to its destination." 

\end{quotation}

We see here, consequently, a vivid description of a well organised 
relay-system as it was in use in Europe in,the XV, XVIand XVII centurie. With regard to teh messengers themselves we find some particulars in another publication of the Ministry of Commerce and Communications, from which we quote as follows:



Before Siam issued its first stamp, there was a limited mail service, mainly for the royal family. Domestic mail travelled by messengers while international mail travelled by steamboat to post offices in nearby countries, such as the Straits Settlements.
The earliest recorded mail from Bangkok dates back only to 1836 when American missionary Dan Beach Bradley sent a letter to his father in a stampless cover. The British Consular Post Office in Bangkok was established by Great Britain in 1858 as a consequence of a treaty signed between Great Britain and Siam (now known as Thailand) on 1855-04-18, and in response to a demand by expatriate merchants and missionaries. It ceased to provide service on 1 July 1885, the day Siam joined the Universal Postal Union and started its own international postal service. During that time most of the mail from Bangkok was sent by diplomatic pouch to Singapore for forwarding. Thus most such mail has a Singapore cancel.
First stamps[edit]

Siam issued its first stamp, the Solot Series, on 4 August 1883.[1]

The letter states 'I deem myself fortunate in just meeting the homeward bound fleet under way which opportunity I take with much pleasure to advise you of my safe arrival in Bengal Rivers as we have been longer on the voyage than I expected but very fortunate in meeting with no enemy though there are a number of privateers in the Bay which we must have very narrowly escaped. I shall in al probability reach Calcutta in two or three days whereupon I shall write you more fully. At the first oportunity you will be good enough to mention this to Mr. Taylor with compliments as I defer writing to him until I get to town. A merry Christmas to you, it is more than I have had ...

Thailand, 1782 Submission to the Chinese Emperor from the Minister of Protocol, regarding the funeral of the head of Siamese Mission who died en route to Beijing, with manuscript acceptance by the Emperor in his own hand ("as proposed"), with the date "9th day, 3rd month, Year 47" (April 1782) entered as filing note. Some splitting along folds as to be expected, the last fold of the Submission normally containing the date having become detached and lost, with the year of the Submission nevertheless mentioned in the contents and the filing note. Very fine, one of the earliest pieces of Imperial Chinese correspondence related to Siam that went through the courier post (ichan or yizhan) and probably the only such mail related to the short-lived Thonburi Dynasty in private hands. 
Estimate HK$ 80,000 - 100,000 
The Submission details the account of death of the Head of the Mission, Piyason Tunyapaina, in Xicheng County on 14th day, 12th month, Year 46 in the Reign of Emperor Qianlong (January 1782), probably of diarrhea, and reports to the Emperor due protocol to be afforded to his funeral. The mission was despatched by the Siamese King of Thonburi Dynasty (1768-1782), Somdet Phra Chao Taksin the Great (Phra Chao Krung Thonburi, Somdet Phra Borommaracha IV), who was born on 17 April 1734 of Chinese descent and had driven out the Burmese occupiers, re-establishing an independent Siamese Kingdom. He reigned from 6 November 1767 for 15 years and was said to become insane in his later years. He was executed on 7 April 1782 at the age of 47 and was succeeded by the present Rama dynasty.

The Thai envoy would have landed in Canton and, as a foreign envoy, enjoyed free passage and proper reception along the yizhan enroute to Peking. (Yizhan, or ichan, which initially referred to a national web of courier stations to relay official mails and receive travelling officials, later became a general term to refer to the Imperial courier posts of China.) The message of the death of the envoy would need to be conveyed to Peking by yizhan, initiating the Ministry of Protocol's Submission. It was returned by the Imperial Court with Emperor Qian Long's approval in his own hand ("as proposed") and the date 9th day, 3rd month, Year 47 (April 1782) was entered as a filing note. 
Realized HK$92,000. Interasia

\section{Foreign Service}

The connections between Thailand and foreign countries existed at that time mainly by sea though there were also some possible routes via land to Burma in the west, to China in the North, to Indo-China in the East, and to the Malay Peninsula to the South. As the foreign mail chiefly consisted of correspondence of high Thai officials for the sake of their trade monopolies and of that of foreigners who lived mainly in or near  Ayuthya, or later in or near Bangkok, the way by sea was the most frequented.

During this period numerous British, Danish, Portuguese and French vessels were calling at Bangkong or Penang. We also see the vessels of the Thai kings and nobles not only carrying goods, but the necessary mail. Their visits as they were at that time only sailing ships, was highly dependent on teh trade winds, i.e., on the North-East Monsonn in spring and on the South-East Monsoon in autumn. On teh other hand it is quite impossible for the time being any particular dates about organisations of such mail. Winds, loaded goods, nationality of vessels dictated time and destination, and the good-will of the captains was more important than the urgency of the letters.
