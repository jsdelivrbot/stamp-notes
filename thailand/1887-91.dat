# 1887-91 Issue

Thailand was admitted to membership of the UPU on July 1, 1885.
As soon as Siam joined the Postal Union, the Minister of
Posts and Telegraphs decided that the stamps then in use
with only native inscription would be a source of much
inconvenience to foreigners and that a new series should be
prepared giving the value in English figures", which
should meet the requirements of the new rates fixed upon by
the Conventions of the Posial. Union. It was also intended
that the new stamps should serve for both postal and
revenue purposes. 

The stamps were surface printed by Messrs. De la Rue & Co., of London, in sheets of 120 stamps
arranged in ten rows of twelve. The series was completed in
1886, but the stamps were not issued until April, 1887.
On January 4th, 1887, the following notification was issued
by the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, from the General
Post Office, Bangkok

\begin{blockquote}
Notification Respecting the New Stamps.

"On the ist April, 1887, the Postal Department of the Kingdom of Siam will issue a new supply of postage stamps and post cards, including the following denominations, viz., stamps of a, .3, 4, 8, iz, 24 and 64 atts; international 4 att post cards, and the same with reply 8 atts. " The new stamps may be used for prepaying either inland
or international mail matter, also for custom and duty
purposes ; but after the above date the current stamps and
post cards can be used only for inland correspondence. "Therefore any mail matter for other administrations, or
for countries foreign to the Postal Union, the postage of which is prepaid with the stamps heretofore in use, will be
considered as unpaid after April next, and treated as such. However, in order that the public may have ample time to comply with this regulation, it is arranged that the old la att stamps and the international 4 att post cards will be received
at any office in exchange for new stamps or cards of corres- ponding denominations during the months of April, May and
June. Exchange for cash is not allowable."

\section{Design of the Stamps}

The new stamps showed a full face portrait of the King in
an oval. A native inscription in white characters on a horseshoe
shaped band of colour extends round the upper twothirds
of the oval, and the top angles of the design are
squared up with triangular ornaments. In the lower angles
are two octagonal tablets bearing in the left-hand one the
value expressed in Siamese characters, and in the right-hand
one the value in English characters, between the tablets in
small white capitals on a ground of colour is the inscription
SIAM—POSTAGE—\&REVENUE in three lines.

\section{Colours.}

The stamps are all bi-coloured, the same head plate serving
for all values, and the small octagonal tablets of value being
printed afterwards, each denomination from a separate duty,
plate. Of the seven values 2, 3, 4, 8, la, 24 and 64 atts, the
design proper is printed in green on the first four stamps and
in purple on the three highest values, the tablets containing
the values being printed in a diotinctive colour for each denomination,
viz. . carmine, blue, brown, yellow, carmine, blue
and brown respectively for the seven stamps. These colours
vary in intensity, and collectors of shades will find differences
in the red, the blue and the brown colours.
The " Chakr " Watermark,
All the stamps were printed on paper watermarked with a
curious native emblem. Mr. C. A. Howes a close student of
Oriental matters relating to philately, says : " The watermark .
of the Siamese stamps has usually been described as a ' lotus
flower.' It may resemble, at first glance, the conventionalized
lotus bloom used for a watermark on some stamps manufactured
by Messrs. De la Rue & Co., but in this case it is something
entirely different. It is an emblem used by the royal
house of Siam and is called a chakr, translated literally as
' wheel.' It represents a mythological circular weapon which,
when thrown, was supposed to return, boomerang-like, to the
thrower. It usually has a companion weapon, a trident,
called the kri. The two are used as a crest on the royal coatof-
arms, and the \textit{chakr} appears on Siamese naval flags to
denote rank."
