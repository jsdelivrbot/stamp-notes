\chapter{1907 Provisional Fiscal}

It may, therefore, be of interest to state that the supply of these " postal
fiscals " was so limited that they were never sold to the public in the ordinary
sense of the word, and it was only by special application to the postal
authorities that a single unused specimen could be obtained, and to lend
additional interest to this statement I append the actual figures regarding
the number of stamps issued and used over a period of eighteen months from
April, 1907, to October, 1908:—

10 ticals, 2 instalments of 1000 each.

20 ticals, 2 instalments of 1000 and 600 respectively.

40 ticals, 2 instalments of 1000 and 600 respectively.

The second printing, or rather supply of provisionals, was made owing to
the delay in receiving the new " Statue " issue from Europe. Thus, of the
10 ticals the total number issued was 2000, of the 20 ticals 1600, and of the
40 ticals 1600. Practically all were used for the purpose required, and a
generous estimate of those still remaining unused in the hands of dealers and
collectors would be 60 of the 10 tical, 40 of the 20 tical, and 30 of the
40 tical value. And yet, in spite of this, we see the 40 ticals stamp, unused
and mint, of which there can be at the most only thirty still extant, selling
at public auction for £3 73. 66., although the actual face value of the stamp
is £3. Such a condition of affairs, to my mind, requires explanation, and is
certainly deserving of comment.

I am well aware that in philatelic circles there has always been a tendency
to regard with suspicion the issue of very large value postage stamps, especially
by countries pf minor importance, and I heartily agree that this attitude is
a very justifiable one, as in nearly every case there has been no genuine
postal necessity for a stamp of a higher value than 2os.; and, moreover, in the
case of British Colonies, the very fact that the stamps are inscribed Postage
and "Revenue" clearly shows the use for which these stamps are intended by
the issuing Government, the " Postage" being merely retained in order to
obviate the necessity of engraving an additional plate.
I think, then, that I am on firm ground when I say that the two factors
mentioned above are those upon which the mistrust of collectors is justifiably
based, and I therefore wish to emphasize, with all the force at my command,'
that the high value Siamese stamps came into existence under circumstances
in direct opposition to those already alluded to, since—
(1) They were issued to meet a genuine and very acute postal demand, and
(2) They have never, at any time, been used for revenue purposes.
There is, perhaps, yet another argument which might be advanced against
these high-value stamps, though this will only apply to the " Statue " stamps,
and that is that this issue was purely a commemorative one and, as such, to
be avoided by all " good " philatelists. I admit the apparent reason of this
argument; but it can be dispelled in a few lines, for, although these stamps
were issued at the late King's Jubilee in 1908, and bear his effigy on horseback,
yet they have been in constant and daily use ever since that date, at
the present time concurrently with the new issue, and the relation between
the design chosen and the date of issue is a pure coincidence.
It simply amounted to the fact that the stamps were urgently required,
and as the King's Jubilee was rapidly approaching, it was naturally felt that
no more suitable design than the King's statue, and no more suitable time
for issue than the date of the Jubilee could possibly be chosen. But these
stamps are not commemorative stamps, in the sense that philatelists understand
the term, in any shape or form.

Having thus disposed of this argument, and it is to be hoped effectively,
I return now to the two statements which I have made regarding the need
for high value stamps, and will proceed to deal with each in turn.
(i) They were issued to meet a genuine and very acute postal demand.
Readers are invited to refer to page 83 of the issue of the Stamp Lover
for October, 1911, where they will find a very interesting statement,
quoted by Mr. R. W. H. Row from Ewen's Stamp Weekly, which deals very
fully with the reasons for the issue of these provisionals.

To sum the statement up for the benefit of those readers who have no
access to the Stamp Lover, I may say that for some considerable period the
Chinese Societies in Bangkok, which are numerous and powerful, were in
the habit of sending large packets of letters to China to be distributed over
the countryside by their agents in the different Chinese ports. The Societies
avoided postage upon these packets at that time, as China had no inland
post, and the Siamese Postal Department were therefore unable to make the

quoted by Mr. R. W. H. Row from Ewen's Stamp Weekly, which deals very
fully with the reasons for the issue of these provisionals.
To sum the statement up for the benefit of those readers who have no
access to the Stamp Lover, I may say that for some considerable period the
Chinese Societies in Bangkok, which are numerous and powerful, were in
the habit of sending large packets of letters to China to be distributed over
the countryside by their agents in the different Chinese ports. The Societies
avoided postage upon these packets at that time, as China had no inland
post, and the Siamese Postal Department were therefore unable to make the
charge of foreign postage upon each letter, since they could not guarantee
delivery, J am informed that a so-called customs export duty of one att per letter was levied upon these packets by the Siamese authorities. At the end
of 1906, however, the Chinese Postal Department notified the authorities in
Bangkok that they had instituted inland posts throughout the country and
would undertake the delivery of all letters. The Siamese authorities at once
seized the opportunity and notified the Chinese Societies in Bangkok that
they were prepared to undertake the collection of all letters to China, and
that in future all letters must pay the full rate of foreign postage, namely
8 atts (now 14 satang) for every 15 grammes.
Eventually an agreement was made by which the Secretary of each
Society was allowed to continue to collect the letters of his society as
formerly, and bring them in one bag or sack to the post office, at the same
time paying the current rate of foreign postage upon each letter. The
Post Office would then forward the packet to the Chinese Post Office at the
port of destination, who would distribute the letters. Many of the packets
contained several hundreds of letters, and the assistant to the Postmaster-
General himself told me that, when the arrangement was first started, he
had obliterated and tied to the bag a whole sheet of tical stamps (100), one
tical being then the highest value Siamese stamp. Such a procedure was at
once seen to be not only impracticable, but indicative of inefficiency; it was
he, therefore, who suggested the use of high value provisional stamps, pending
the supply of a regular issue.
(2) They have never at any time been used as Revenue stamps.
It is perhaps not generally known that the provisional stamps in their
original state were not fiscal stamps of a general nature, but were stamps
used solely by the Ministry of Justice in satisfaction of fees paid ; and also
that the values of the three stamps themselves, before being surcharged for
postal use, were 10, 20, and 40 ticals respectively. These facts alone
are, in my opinion, sufficient in themselves to dispel any suspicion that the
provisional or the " Statue" stamps were created or required for any revenue
purpose. Special mention is made of the fact that the postage provisionals
were created from judicial stamps of equal value, thus 10 ticals on 10,
20 on 20, and 40 on 40, for the reason that many forgeries are said to
exist on stamps of lower values, such as 10 ticals on the i att and 2 atts
stamps (which are the same design, size, and colour as the stamps of high
value), from which the judicial cancellation has been removed, and it is
also said that the forged surcharge is an excellent imitation of the genuine
one. Collectors are therefore warned to look carefully at the original value
of the stamp, before exchanging or purchasing the green provisionals.

Finally, in publishing these notes and in urging the philatelic claims to
rarity of the high value Siamese stamps, the writer wishes to assure his
readers, that he has no large stock of these stamps to unload upon a trusting
public, but is merely impelled by the desire to see philatelists accord to these
" green fiscals " and " Statue" stamps their true status of genuine postage
stamps of considerable rarity and, in the case of the unused green
provisionals, allow them, in due time, a place in the sun almost as exalted
as that occupied by the British 10s., £1, and £5, on blued paper, a place
to which they should become entitled before many years have passed over
our heads. 

This desire will, the writer feels sure, be recognized as possessing  a still stronger claim to sincerity, if he is permitted to compare the claims
of these stamps with those of the Cayman Islands and similar small Colonial
possessions, which though redolent of jobbery, are still considered by many
to possess undoubted claims to philatelic value.
