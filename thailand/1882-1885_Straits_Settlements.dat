\chapter{Straits Settlements Service at Bangkok (1862-1865)}

The growing quantity of mail sent overseas as well as the remarkable improvement in the general postal conditions in India and other British territories, however, necessarily required a considerable change in the treatment of the mail from Thailand to western destinations. Though Thailand herself, as will be explained later, made already energetic preparations to establish a postal organisation of her own, this foreign mail service urgently needed more security and regulations with regard to speed, rates prepayment and transportation.

The result of these considerations was a special arrangement between the Governments of Thailand and the Straits Settlements, early in 1882, which secured all these improvements and facilities. it embraced the handling of all mail from thailand for the West.

To facilitate the prepayment of these rates special postage stamps were sent from Singapore to Bangkong. They consisted of the stamps then in use in the Straits Settlements, but with an overprinted B. 

The overprint on all these stamps consisted of a large Roman "B" impressed in black, the top half of the letter being 2 2/3 mm high by 2.25mm wide, and the bottom half 3mm high by 2 3/4 mm wide.

The first of these stamps appeared on September 1st, 1882, and was the already once surcharged stamp, the 32 cents on 2 annas yellow, issued originally in the Straits Settlments, in 1867.

\section{How the Mails were Carried}

Melville quotes from a writer in \textit{L'Echo de la Timbrologie} gives an account of the methods of transportation of letters and messages in Siam at the time the above-described stamps were in use.
\begin{quotation}
In the kingdom of Siam the rivers and canals fulfil teh functions of roads, and streets: it is this fact which caused Bangkong to be nick-named `The Asiatic Venice' and which explains the presence of the numerous boats taht are seen circulating the city at all hours of the day.

\end{quotation}

For longer distances teh form of tranportation was the elephant:

\begin{quotation}
The elephant also, plays a very important part as a means of transportation. In this connection we cite particularly teh `Chang Kup Tang Tua Prom' or travelling elephant, richly harnessed and covered with a scarlet saddle-cloth, which serves to carry both travellers and letters to distant parts of the vast territory of the empire of Siam.
\end{quotation}


On the 1st July, 1885, the Postal Administration of Thailand joined the Universal Postal Union. Both the Hongkong and the Straits Settlements mail services through the British Consulate-General were consequently suspended. This was done with mutual agreement with the British authorities and was analogous to the suspension of similar services in other territories, such Cuba, Fernando Po and Puerto Rico in 1877, Peru in 1879 etc.
