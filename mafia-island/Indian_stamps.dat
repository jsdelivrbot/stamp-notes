Eventually Indian stamps were available for issue in September and these, as required were overprinted.

In September 1916 it was decided that Mafia should be administered by the
Zanzibar Government to whom the postal revenue
was to accrue. As instructed Captain Brook destroyed the dies.

Lieut. Clark R.N. of the Zanzibar Administration, took over the island as
Officer-in-Charge, and almost immediately
received a cable from the Colonial Office reversing the order to destroy the dies!
He had therefore to obtain another die, from Zanzibar
which was overprinted on the remaining stock and on further consignment
of I.E.F. stamps as required.

Stamps on fragments are rare and very rare on envelopes. Prices are relatively low given the low volume printing of these
stamps. Forgeries exist and one should be alert when buying material of such scarcity. 


On August 6th 1918 the island was placed under the Tanaganyika Territory Administration and all remaining stamps and dies were destroyed.
