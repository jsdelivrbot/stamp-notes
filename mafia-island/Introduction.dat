\chapter{Mafia Island}

The British occupation of Mafia (January 1915) was followed by the perpetration of some
thoroughly nasty issues. A good account is given by A.B. Vialou \textit{The London Philatelist}.[1] 
The information may be supplemented with advantage by two auction catalogues. Marques of Bute
collection: Robson Lowe, London, No. 1827-8.20th May, 1959 and Dr H. Schoutencollection:
R. Postema, Amsterdam, No. 205, 5th April, 1966. (the latter includes much of the
former collection). More collections came in the market since then but mostly recycle older material.

There were few German East African stamps on the island, and the majority of these werehandstamped GR MAFIA and transferred rapidly into the hands of collectors

The numbers overprinted were said to be as follows:

\begin{tabular}{llr}
7 1/2 H & &140\\
2i, 4, 15, 20, 30, 45H &each &40\\
1, 2, 3, R. &each &15\\
\end{tabular}



To judge by recent auctions the quantities of some values could well be understated!
This handstamp is known used as an arrival mark (Bute sale 1959).

The handstamp is found in violet or black. Clearly impressed overprints are few and
far between. A few 'Used' copies are recorded.
This outburst was followed by the manufacture of another handstamp reading:

This was apparently made up from loose letters. It was used (correctly) on letters handed
in at the military post office for which postage was paid in cash. A few commercial covers
have survived. The covers are addressed to Timotheo in Zanzibar and appear to be philatelic in nature.

This mark exists with inverted second 'A' in 'Mafia'. Fig. 14.

This handstamp was applied to a further cache of German East African stamps and to a
few current Zanzibar issued. This episode produced more nasty rare stamps, none of which
appear to have done postal duty, although copies are known cancelled F.P.O. 322 or 343
(Bute collection). Covers are apparently not known.


Having used up all postage stamps within sight an attack was then made on revenue
stamps. These exist with a circular handstamp inscribed OHBMS Mafia, and some with a
further handstamp GR/Post/Mafia, other exist with only the latter mark. These were
perpetrated in 1915 and 1916. Covers of all three of them are known, made for collectors.
Some are German emergency envelopes presumably liberated in the summer of 1916. It is at
least possible that a further supply of revenue stamps were found at the same time. Covers
are far from common.

These monstrosities were followed by a fairly reputable issue: I.E.F. stamps handstamped
GR/POST/MAFIA as the last issue.

Again these were seized upon and resulted in some very nasty covers: registered items
with stamps uncancelled are normal, for there was no cancellation available initially. Some
sets were cancelled by ingenious use of the Zanzibar paquebot mark.
However, this issue had some commercial use; as witness the covers displayed. Some of
them look as if the handstamp was applied as a cancellation, falling partly on the cover.
Fig. 15. This issue was followed by a further (italic) handstamp apparently not much used
commercially. Ordinary I.E.F. stamps were then used and later the G.E.A. overprints on
E.A. and U stamps.

Two military covers are illustrated. Figs. 16 and 17.
Apparently Mafia came under Zanzibar until 1919 but used G.E.A. overprints!
Dangerous forgeries exist. The c-d-s above has been imitated. The imitation has larger
letters and relatively narrower A's than genuine. It is thought to have been applied to some
of the collectors' specials mentioned above (Mafia registered, stamps uncancelled). Fig. 19

A force commanded by Lieut. Colonel Mackay, despatched by G.O.C. East African Forces from Mombasa, captured the island
on December 16th 1914. This provided a base for operations against the German raider \textit{Koenigsberg}, who had been driven
to take refuge in the Rufiji River after she had taken considerable toll of Allied shipping. The operation was concluded
when the ship was scuttled by her crew.




##Postal History

After the capture of the island the restoration of postal facilities (under censorship for the local population)
was arranged by Lieut. Colonel J.D.Mackay, who was appointed Military Governor.

A limited number of German stamps captured were overprinted "G.R.I. MAFIA". The usual field post offices were operated by the
invading force.

The overprinting was done by a hand-stamp made up from an amateur printing set, at first in violet which, after complaints
from the Zanzibar postal authorities was altered to black. A few Zanzibar stamps handed in were similarly treated.

###First Mail

The first mail carrying stamps thus overprinted was despatched on "January 22nd 1915".

By May the Zanzibar authorities provided a die lettered "G.R.-POST-6 CENTS-MAFIA" with instructions to place the overprint on all values.

A very limited number of stamps were printed in this manner. Black, green or viole ink was used.

Damage to the Die caused a new setting, the spacing of "G.R.", formerly 3mm became 5.5 mm in the new set up.

The numbers overprinted were so small that only one known full set is known.

At the end of July 1915, Capatin W.B. Brook followed Lieut. Colonel Mackay as Military
Governor.  By now the German Colonial stamps were exhausted and for a few days
letters were franked with the above "6 CENTS" surcharge. These are rare.

\section{Overprints on I.E.F. stamps}

The next issue (which is listed by Stanley Gibbons, Nos. 13-22) was of stamps of India
overprinted "I. E. F." in black ink, with additional overprint of "G.R. POST MAFIA"
in violet, green or black, in three lines, sometimes sideways and sometimes inverted.
(Illustration 8 on Plate 3.)

Some Indian stamps were used in Mafia with only the overprint "I.E.F." I have further
examples of Indian "I. E. F." stamps overprinted Mafia but without the further overprint
"G.R. Post".

Later on these "I.E.F.'"stamps were overprinted "G.R. POST MAFIA" in italics in
black in three lines (S.G. Nos. 23-32).
