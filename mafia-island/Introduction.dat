A force commanded by Lieut. Colonel Mackay, despatched by G.O.C. East African Forces from Mombasa, captured the island
on December 16th 1914. This provided a base for operations against the German raider _Koenigsberg_, who had been driven
to take refuge in the Rufiji River after she had taken considerable toll of Allied shipping. The operation was concluded
when the ship was scuttled by her crew.

##Postal History

After the capture of the island the restoration of postal facilities (under censorship for the local population)
was arranged by Lieut.-Colonel J.D.Mackay, who was appointed Military Governor.

A limited number of German stamps captured were overprinted __G.R.I. MAFIA__. The usual field post offices were operated by the
invading force.

The overprinting was done by a hand-stamp made up from an amateur printing set, at first in violet which, after complaints
from the Zanzibar postal authorities was altered to black. A few Zanzibar stamps handed in were similarly treated.

###First Mail

The first mail carrying stamps thus overprinted was despatched on __January 22nd 1915__.

By may the Zanzibar authorities provided a die lettered __G.R.-POST-6 CENTS-MAFIA__ with instructions to place the
overprint on all values.

A very limited number of stamps were printed in this manner. Black, green or viole ink was used.

Damage to the Die caused a new setting, the spacing of __G.R.__, formerly 3mm became 5.5 mm in the new set up.

__The numbers overprinted were so small that only one known full set is known__.

At the end of July 1915, Capatin W.B. Brook followed Lieut. Colonel Mackay as Military
Governor.  By now the German Colonial stamps were exhausted and for a few days
letters were franked with the above __6 CENTS__ surcharge. These are rare.

In September 1916 it was decided that Mafia should be administered by the Zanzibar Government to whom the postal revenue
was to accrue. As instructed Captain Brook destroyed the dies.

Lieut. Clark R.N. of the Zanzibar Administration, took over the island as Officer-in-Charge, and almost immediately
received a cable from the Colonial Office reversing the order to destroy the dies! He had therefore to obtain another die, from Zanzibr
which was overprinted on the remaining stock and on further consignment of I.E.F. stamps as required.

Stamps on fragments are rare and very rare on envelopes. Prices are relatively low given the low volume printing of these
stamps. Forgeries exist and one should be alert when buying material of such scarcity. 

With about $ 30000 one can basically complete the country for an exhibition display.
 
__On August 6th 1918 the island was placed under the Tanaganyika Territory Administration and all remaining stamps and dies were destroyed__
