## Nova Scotia

The first stamps of Nova Scotia were recess-printed by Perkins, Bacon & Co in sheets of 120 for the 1d and in sheets of 160 for the others. The design of the 3d., 6d., and 1/- are very similar to those of the pence value of [New Brunswick](../new-brunswick/introduction) issue with the only difference being that the heraldic flowers include the mayflower of Nova Scotia. The designer's name is unknown.\footnote{Lowe}

Valuations for the stamps vary widely with condition. The most important guideline in purchasing these stamps is to have fresh colours and even ample margins. Depending on condition they can fetch anything from 5% to 100% of catalogue value.

The Nova Scotia postal system was under the direct control of the General Post office 
in London from 1754 until 1851. In the pre-adhesive period prior to 1851, 
postal markings followed the British pattern with new devices being introduced in standard forms.


In 1851 Nova Scotia became responsible for its own postal system. Postmaster General Woodhouse 
remained in charge until Nova Scotia became a Province of Canada in 1867. 
Adhesive postage stamps denominated in pence and shilling were introduced in the fall of 1851. 
Bisecting of Nova Scotia stamps 
was authorized in 1854 to accommodate the new seven and one-half pence rate to England.

The 1851 issue stamps of Nova Scotia, although 
printed in several separate printings, were sent to Nova 
Scotia in only three shipments. The first and second shipments both occurred in the fall of 1851. 
The last shipment took place in July, 1857. 
Although some catalogs list several distinct shades, 
this exhibitor believes that only the two distinct shades 
of each value, representing the 1851 shipments and the 1857 shipment, deserve recognition. 
In 1853 a one penny value was added to the set. This stamp exists in only one shade from a 
single shipment made in April, 1853.

The bisecting of the three and six pence stamps was first authorized by Postmaster General 
Woodgate in October, 1854 specifically to make up the 7 1/2 pence rate to Great Britain. 
Other bisects were accepted but not authorized. 
On January 1, 1860 Nova Scotia switched to a decimal currency and the pence issue was replaced.
