In 1860 after the adoption of decimal currency in January a new set denominated in cents was issued. Five different
cents denominations were issued in October, 1860. An additional two cents value was added in May, 1863 to accomodate the new postal rate for letters within the same
county. All of the stamps were engraved and printed by the American Bank Note Company of New York.

There were two printings of the two cents, eight and one half cents, ten cents and twelve and
one half cents values. Three printings were needed for the one cent and five printings for the
five cents value.

Although the issue has some very minor production varieties, the only major variety occurs
on the one cent. It exists imperforate vertically. It is believed the five or six sheets were
produced. Toned paper variations are reported existing in the same sheet with normal paper on some values.

This issue was gradually replaced by the stamps of Canada after Nova Scotia became part of the
Confederation on July 1, 1867. In February, 1895 remainders of unused Nova Scotia stamps were sold
by the government. There were no five cents stamps included.
