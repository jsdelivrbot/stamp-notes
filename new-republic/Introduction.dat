##New Republic

The {{wi:New_Republic_(South_Africa)}} was a short lived republic created by Boers in South Africa. These stamps are difficult to collect as they don't appear on the market very often and they extremely rare on covers and pieces. One also needs to watch out for forgeries. The stamps can be categorized in two main categories depending if they bear a date or not.
