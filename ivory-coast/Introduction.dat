\cote, or the Ivory Coast, is a country in West Africa established as a French colony in 1893, and becoming independent in 1960. For period 1944-1958
see [Benin](../benin/Introduction), French
1892-1944


\subsection{Early Mails}

The French established trading posts during several time periods, but the first post office, at San P\edro, dates from 1847, with Grand Bassam, Jacqueville, and Assinie getting offices in 1890.[1]


\subsection{First issue of stamps}

The first use of postage stamps was at Assinie from 1862, where the French Colonies general issues were available. The cancellation was an "ASI" in a lozenge of dots.


\subsection{First stamps of the colony}

The colony received its own stamps in November 1892, just a few months prior to formal establishment. As typical for French colonies of the time, these were of the Navigation and Commerce design, with 13 values ranging from 1 centime to 1 franc. Four of the values were reissued with color changes in 1900, and several were surcharged in 1904 and again in 1912.

\subsection{Twentieth century}

The colony participated in the West Africa commemorative stamp of 1906, and in 1913 an issue of stamps depicting a river scene started a long series that continued in use until the mid-1930s.



In the meantime, post offices multiplied, with 38 in existence throughout the territory by 1915.

When Upper Volta was dissolved in 1933, several of its provinces were added to \cote, and 16 types of its stamps were overprinted "\cote".

Stamps of French West Africa superseded Ivoirean stamps from 1944 to 1959.


On 1 October 1959, the first issue of the new republic went on sale. The three values depicted an elephant, and were inscribed "R\epublique de \cote".

F&#233;lix Houphou&#235;t-Boigny (French pronunciation: [feliks ufw&#603;t bwa&#626;i];[1] 18 October 1905 &#8211; 7 December 1993), affectionately called Papa Houphou&#235;t or Le Vieux, was the first President of C&#244;te d'Ivoire. 

Originally a village chief, he worked as a doctor, an administrator of a plantation, and a union leader, before being elected to the French Parliament and serving in a number of ministerial positions in the French government. From the 1940s until his death, he played a leading role in the decolonization of Africa and in his country's politics.

The first definitive series of the republic, in 1960, depicted masks from various tribes.




\subsection{Federation}


The French colonial territories federated into French West Africa (AEF) in 1895 issued their own postage stamps until 1943. In many cases the stamps were inscribed with the name of the federation as well as the colony's own name. These included Mauritania, Senegal, French Sudan (now Mali), French Guinea (now Guinea), Cote d'Ivoire, Niger, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) and Dahomey (now Benin). In 1943 and 1944, stamps of Senegal and Mauritania were overprinted with new values and valid throughout French West Africa. The first issues printed specifically for the federation were the Eboue common design type and a definitive series depicting colonial soldiers, both in 1945.
A series of 1947 featured 19 scenes and people of the various colonies, then during the 1950s there were about 30 various commemoratives. The last issue inscribed "Afrique occidentale fran&#231;aise" and "RF" was the Human Rights issue of December 1958. It was followed by a Stamp Day issue on March 21, 1959, which omitted the federation's name and was inscribed "CF" along with "Dakar-Abidjan".
