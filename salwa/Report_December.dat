# Executive Summary

## Materials

Material submittals have now been flowing better, but there are delays in the following materials that need to be expedited.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Chiller Plant
\item TRO
\end{enumerate}

These are major equipment and we expect also that we will need time to get them approved. This is now expected to delay the Project.

### Summary of Submittals

A summary of submittal is shown below. A more detailed. 


## Budget

Currently materials are within budget. The personnel mobilized to site are also within the budget.


# Engineering

Engineering has progressed well, with drawings now standing at 75%. We expect that the rest of the drawings will not be completed on time unless the materials discussed above are finalized. 

Returns from the Consultants are slow. We have taken action to speed this up.
