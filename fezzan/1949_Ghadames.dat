## Fezzan

### 1949, French occupation Issues, Ghadames 

In 1948 France subdivided Fezzan into Fezzan and Ghadames. 
On August 1, 1949 a set of 10 values for Ghadames was issued
for the payment of postage and airmail service. The set consisted
of eight values for postage and two for airmail. The stamps were
designed by Besson and engaved by Cortot.

The issue consists of a single basic design, known as the Cross of Agadem.

The issue is interesting as it was the first time a bicolored set was issued during the entire period of the French occupation of Fezzan. The stamps were printed at the Government Printing Works in Paris on un-watermarked paper. The stamps were printed in sheets of 25 stamps (5x5), perforation 13. 

Since the issue is bicoloured there are "color plate proofs" in various colour combinations.  

The issue is also notable for the very rare colour "error". This is the only known error among the 87 different stamps produced for Fezzan and Ghadames. The rare error can be found with regard to teh high value only when only one sheet of 25 stamps of the 100-franc value was accidentally printed in the colour of the 50-franc.

Anothr distinguishing feature of the 1949 Ghadames  issue is that the stamps are scarcer than the regular issues of Fezzan. Although the issue had a relatively long life of about two and a half years, not many stamps were sold and used. 

All of the above factors contributed to lower sales for the Ghadames issue, the bulk of which was destroyed by the French Government at the end of the occupation. The first 10 stamps are scarce in mint condition and almost rare in used condition. 

Imperforate stamps, artists proofs and "de luxe sheets"  exist. 

The Ghadames issue concludes all of the stamps issued for the French Military Occupation of Libya.
