\section{French Occupation Issues}

{{wi:Fezzan}} is a south-western region of modern Libya. It is largely desert but broken by mountains, uplands, and dry river valleys (wadis) in the north, where oases enable ancient towns and villages to survive deep in the otherwise inhospitable Sahara.
Ghadames is an oasis town in the west of [Libya](../libya/introduction). It lies roughly 549 km in the southwest of Tripoli, near the borders with [Algeria](../algeria/Introduction) and [Tunisia](../tunisia/introduction).

Fezzan was captured by Free French forces of [Chad](../chad/Introduction) in 1943 and used stamps of Algeria between 1943 and 1946.

From 6 February 1950 to December 1951 the stamps were overprinted B.A. TRIPOLITANIA.

On 24 December 1951, [Cyrenaica](../cyrenaica/Introduction), [Tripolitania](../tripolitania/Introduction) and Fezzan were unified as the Kingdom of [Libya](../libya/Introduction) under Amir Mohammed Idris Al-Senussi. After unification, stamps of Libya were used.
   
A total of 87 stamps comprise provisional and regular issues of Fezzan-Ghadames, many hard to find, and their postal history (covers) are even more elusive. The locale evolved from an ancient Saharan crossroad of lakes rich with hunting grounds for hippos, rhinos, elephants and giraffes, where mummification of the dead was practiced long before it was adopted in Egypt and where the population lived at the base of cliffs decorated with rock paintings. And then heat parched the land, the Arabs came in 666 A.D., drove out Christianity, and enslaved the people for 1,000 years.


Italy seized Fezzan in 1911, along with [Tripolitania](../tripolitania/Introduction) and then abandoned the area until Mussolini reconquered it 1930. During World War II, it was taken over by General LeClerc and the Free French Forces, and in 1952 became part of Libya, where the stamps are now listed in the Scott catalog "For Use in Fezzan" (Scott 112-121) and "Issued under French Occupation" (Scott 1N1-3NC2).
