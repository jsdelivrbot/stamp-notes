\section{French Occupation Issues}

\subsection{Stamp Printing Procedure}

The French Postal Authorities, when peparing to issue a stamp or series of stamps 
used a fairly standard procedure that accounts for a small quantity of a variety of philatelic materials known to collectors collectively as "French Proofs". These are not normally listed in the General catalogues but can be found in the specialized catalogues.

When a new issue was to be prepared, the Authorities sent a circular to a list of approved artists, requesting a design, details of the design required and deadlines for the submission of drawings.

Once the designs are prepared the Minister of Posts presides at a special meeting to select the most appropriate design for the issue. The selected design is then reduced to the size of the future stamp. An artist is then selected to engave the issue who could be the original designer or someone else. 

\subsubsection{The Engaving of the Issue} 

The artist engaved the approved design on a special soft steel die that was imported from Great Britain and which the French Government supplied free for the purpose. When the engraving was completed the engraver tested the design by pulling a proof on a small hand operated press. This proof is called the "First Stage Proof".  After work on the die progresses further a second proof was sometimes  made which is called the second stage. These \textit{"Progressive Proofs"}, sometimes called \textit{Unfinished} or \textit{Intermediate proofs} were imperforate and are very rare as only one or two may exist. Some artists did not make these "Progressive Proofs" at all or they have not kept them which explains why they do not exist for many stamps. 

When the artist completed the design and was satified, imperforate proofs were test-printed one at a time on a small hand press. Only 20 proofs, usually divided into five colours were made but in many css unequally divided.

For many years these artists proofs were only printed in black.  The quantity of these proofs was limited as the die was still soft and could get damaged if a larger quantity of proofs were printed. As a matter of fact a 1956 directive __limited__ the quantity to no more than 18 proofs.

These "artists proofs" were printed on thin white cardboard, roughly 4 1/2 x 5 1/2
inches and most artists signed them. It should eb nted that some of these
proofs are on watermarked paper with the name of the manufacture: "Rives",
"Marais", "B.F.K.", "Ram's Head" etc. When the cardboard sheets were
divided only a few perhaps only 5 per cent, contained all or part of the watermark.
