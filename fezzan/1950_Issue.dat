\subsection{1950 Postage Due Issue}
In 1950, Henri Razous, who was an inspector of the P.T.T. for the area at the end of the occupation, designed the only regular pictorial postage dues for Fezzan. The set comprises six values. They were lined engraved by Feltesse and depict the oasis at Brak.

The stamps were printed in Paris, France by the A.F.T.P. and are perforated 13. They were issued in brown-black for the one franc value, dark emerald for the two franc, dark brown-red for the three franc, deep red violet for the five franc, scarlet for the ten franc and deep blue for the 25 franc stamp. 

In mint condition they are available at modest prices. Used copies and on cover are extremely scarce.

The set also exists on a rare single collective artist proof in black of which only six copies were issued. Regular deluxe sheets, artists proofs, and die colour proofs also exist. No imperforate stamps are known for this issue.

This set of semi-postals was also produced by the A.F.T.P. in Paris in sheets of 25 stamps (5 x 5) on unwtermarked paper and are perforated 13. 

They were issued on July 20, 1950.
