## Fezzan, French Occupation Issues
### The First Provisional Issue

The Free French Forces of Colonel DeLange occupied the Fezzan in January 1943. One of the tasks of the Military Commander was to establish normal communications and the setting up of postal services. The Colonel first contacted the authorities at Brazzaville in the French Congo and requested that they furnish the Fezzan Postal Administration with stamps of the then French Equatorial Africa overprinted "Fezzan Occupation Francaise". As the request could not be complied with, Colonel DeLange issued a \textit{"Note de Service N-1/CC"} on January 21, 1943 ordering that all Libyan stamps were to be withdrawn from the area immediately. The plan was t sent the stamps to Cairo Egypt to be overprinted \textit{"FEZZAN A.F.C. 1943."}

In the end the stamps were sent to Algeria rather than Cairo, as the air services between Algeria and Fezzan had been established. An Algerian printer, V. Heinz, was instructed to overprint the stamps as ordered by  the \textit{"Note de Service,"}. Apparently V.Heinz received a further set of instructions and in the end teh stamps were overprinted \textit{FEZZAN OCCUPATION FRANCAISE,} as originally requested from the authorities in Brazaville.

As the issue stamps were limited in quantities and to limit the consumpton for philatelic purposes Colonel Delange announced the issue in a \textit{"Note Circulaire"} and directing that each European could only purchase one complete set of the postage, air and postage due stamps. Since the quantities issued were small the supply was quickly exhausted.

Since the printing facilities were rather primitive and the way the stamps were selected the overprinting was quite poor. A number of varieties were inevitably created. For some of the issues it was necessary to run the sheet a number of times through the printing press.
