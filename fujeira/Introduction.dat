On October 15th, 1963, Baroody Stamp Co. Ltd. in Beirut announced that the ruler of Fujairah, Umm al Qiwain, and Ajman will open Independent post offices as follows: 

{{blockquote: Fujairah as from the 22nd November 1963, Umm al Qiwain as from the 27th November 1963, and Ajman as from the 29th November 1963. Also announced that ordinary and registered, sea-mail and airmail correspondence will be accepted and delivered as a starting service.}}
 
On November 22, 1963, Fujairah opened its post office, and while arrangements were underway for the printing of the first definitive issue, British stamps value only, which were used in Dubai and Muscat, have been used in the emirate.
 
On December 30th, 1963, H. M. Political Agency in Dubai, Mr. A. J. M. Craig wrote a letter to the Political Residency in Bahrain, Mr. J. R. Rich, Esq., state:
 
The company's representative, Mr. Stephen, after a long absence turned up last week.  He said he was now ready to open the three post offices, but wanted for the first month to use in them British stamps overprinted (as in Muscat).  Furthermore, he had concluded an agreement with the largest stamp firm in the world J. H. Stolow Inc. of New York, assigning to them all rights in the three Trucial States agreements.  He had also brought with him quantities (14000 at a time) of specially-designed stamps which he proposed should be eventually issued from the three states.
 
 
During 1960s, most probably before the opening the post office, Baroody Stamp Co. brought four British low values stamps (5np, 10np, 15np, and 20np) Value Only from Dubai post office and surcharged them with FUJAIRA for general use through the emirate. These stamps were never been used in the emirate.
 
The large hexagonal "FUJEIRA" cancel, which was introduced before Fujairah issued its first set, was also known used in Value Only British stamps. The hexagonal cancel inscribed "FUJEIRA" in Arabic at the top and English at the bottom and was used in either violet or purple ink.  Fujairah mails at that time were sent either through Dubai or Abu Dhabi in bundles and from their mails were, sent to its destination.
