\section{Spanish Morocco}

I order to properly view Moroccan Postal history, a short introduction to its troubled history is necessary. Morocco has used its own stamps, French, German, English and Moroccan. The story as to how this came about follows:


\begin{itemize}
  \item  1844 French Moroccan War
  \item 1860 Spanish Moroccan War
  \item 1880 Conference of Madrid
  \item 1906 Conference of Algesiras
  \item 1911 Agadir Crisis
   \item 1912 Partition of Morocco into two zones : French and Spanish
      Protectorates
   \item 1923-1958 The International Statute of the City of Tangier
   \item 1956 Moroccan Independence
\end{itemize}
