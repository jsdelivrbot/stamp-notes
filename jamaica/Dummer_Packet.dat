Dummer proposed a monthly service to be operated by four oceangoing packets (Sloops) calling at Barbadoes, Antigua, Montserrat, Nevis and Jamaica.  On June 30th, 1702, the Crown came to terms with Dummer agreeing his plan and granting special concessions.  He was permitted to fly the Queen's colours on his ships, his crews were exempted from impressment for naval service, and he was granted a letter of marque for the duration of the War of the Spanish Succession which had commenced in the same year.  The first transatlantic mail service directly sponsored by the Post Office was inaugurated on October 21st, 1702, with the sailing from Portsmouth for Barbadoes of  (Dummer's) packet Bridgeman.

In 1702, "An Act for Establishing a General Post Office for all Her Majesty's Dominions" was passed. With the passage of this Act, Mr. Dummer was authorized to appoint his own Postmasters in the West Indies and the service was inaugurated. However, only four of the first twelve monthly packets completed the voyage. He lost so many ships by shipwreck and capture, that the service failed in 1711. He died bankrupt in London in 1713. Regular service was not re-established by the Post Office until 1745. (Image)	 Est. $5,000-7,500

Letters to Jamaica could be left there to be carried on their way by the next available ship's captain, a widespread practice, despite the disapproval of the Post Office. The Antegoe was captured on her sixth voyage. (Image)	 Est. $5,000-7,500

CAvendish Description
"DUMMER PACKET" COVER TO G.B. "P. THE EVELIN PACKETT"; May 1711 large part E (probably from Chief Justice Peter Heywood in Kingston; from comparison of hand-writing to a 1708 Dummer Packet letter in the Swarbrick Collection) addressed to Edinburgh and endorsed "p. the Evelin Packett", charged "1/6" and then "In all 2N"; also having a superb "IV/25" London transit Bishop Mark on the side-flap. 

The postal rates prove that this letter was sent in 1711; because the Dummer Packet 
service ended in that year, and the London to Edinburgh postal rate only rose from 5d to 6d 
from June 1711. The final 2s-0d rate is made up of the 1s-6d Dummer Packet 
rate and the extra 6d on from London to Edinburgh. Rare and attractive example 
of the first Jamaica Packets service. [The last Dummer Packet cover sold by Cavendish realised £4,620 in the Swarbrick sale, Sept. 1995.]		Estimated Value: £600
Hammer Price: £800

Dummer was declared bankrupt in February 1711, and although he was released from the Fleet Prison soon afterwards he was recommitted to the Fleet in April 1712.[2] He died there at the end of April 1713 and was buried at St Andrew's, Holborn on 8 May 1713.[46]

After his death, the business at Sowley was bought from his creditor, the Duke of Montagu, by his brother, who ran the ironworks until 1716.[2]

In December 1713, a petition from his widow, Sarah, and his unmarried daughter, Jane, who were close to destitution, was presented to the Navy Board.[2] The petition was heard by Dummer's former political mentor, Robert Harley as Secretary to the Lord High Treasurer.[47] In the light of Dummer's earlier services as a civil engineer, they were granted a pension of £150 per annum.[2][48]

In August 1716, Dummer's estate, including South Stoneham manor and property at Shedfield and Curdridge, were eventually sold by Jane to meet the claims of his creditors.[49] The manor passed to Edward Nicholas of Newton Valence.[44]
