\chapter{The 'JAMAICA' Fleuron Handstamps}    

\lettrine{F}{leuron handstamps} began appearing in the early years of the 19th century. At first they were only used on outgoing correspondence passing through the Post Office at Kingston. Later it is found on letters originating from the varius Post Towns used as a receiving mark.

As Foster says, they are beautiful handstamps but are difficult to find in good condition, as most of the time they are faint and struck across the flap. 

All the Fleuron postmarks consist of the same pattern. The word 'JAMAICA' in large seriffed capitals curved in a semi-circle above the date, which is in two lines across the center. Two curled-up, leaf like ornaments on either side of a small circle are placed at the bottom and complete the listing. Foster identified these handstamps 
with the initial \textbf{F} and a number. Sub-types are identified using lowercase letters. 
There are six main types.
