\chapter{Transit Handstamps}    

After the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, the British Post office found it necessary to speed up 
communication with their Postal Agency branches established in Central American mainland and it soon became customary to ship these letters to Jamaica, which at the time became the western ocean 
terminal for the Post Office Packet.
