\section{Unissued abolition of Slavery}    

This stamp was due for issue in Jamaica in June 1921, but when the first two consignmnets arrived together on 11 May, 1921, the condition of unrest amongst the local population was high, and it was thought that any reference to the bygone days of slavery might be used for purposes of inflammatory propaganda, and for this reason the Governor ordered the stamp to be supressed.

Jamaica: 1921 Unissued Abolition of Slavery 6d., Watermark Mult. Script CA, overprinted ''SPECIMEN'' with gum, horizontal crease at base, otherwise fine. S.G. 91s, cat. \pound700. 
Estimate: \pound100 - \pound120 Grosvenor 2012 dec 6.} 

The stamp went so near to be issued that the usual number of "SPECIMEN" copies went to Berne and distributed by the Permanent Bureau of teh Postal Union. 

Ths number was, as far as cn be ascertained, about 740, and consisted of some copies, with the old watermark and some with the new.

The suppression of this 6d. "Slavery" stamp created a shortage of that denomination, which was met, not by surcharging some other value, but by a cabled orer to England for a reprint of the little 6d. Georgian stamp, which duly makde its appearance on the 21st October, 1921, on the new Script CA paper.

This was followed by an entirely new 6d. Pictorial stamp on the 5 December, 1922.
