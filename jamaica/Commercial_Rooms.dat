\chapter{Commercial Rooms}

At the beginning of the 19th century Post Office regulations allowed merchants trading in the colony
and its environs to accept mail from the masters of private ships in order that they could facilitate
ist early despatch to Britain and elsewhere by the next available ship. On arrival at a British port
the letters were treated as 'SHIP LETTERS'

The agency at the Commercial Rooms was the best known of all the forwarding agents. The Commercial Rooms or the Commercial Buildings as they were sometimes called occupied part of an edifice situated at the south-east corner of Harbour Street and Temple Lane in Kingston. 

Eight different cachets are known to have been used by the agency and all of them are scarce. They can only be found struck in black.
