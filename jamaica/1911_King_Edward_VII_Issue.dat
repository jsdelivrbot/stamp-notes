1189	S	SG 57s	S.G. #57s, 1911 2d Grey, overprinted "SPECIMEN" and affixed to small piece of De La Rue Working Day Book with red ms. "120 Set Dec" notation, very fine; ex-De La Rue Archives (Scott #60s).This stamp was not issued until 3rd February 1911 and is the only Jamaican stamp bearing the likeness of King Edward VII in addition to being the last stamp of the Commonwealth to show his likeness. 1,012 sheets were printed and stocks were exhausted that year. Jamaica nearly "missed the boat" on an Edward VII issue, and had it not been for Astley Clerk and the Jamaica Philatelic Society, it is unlikely there would have been a stamp representing his reign for Jamaica.
