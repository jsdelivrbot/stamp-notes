\chapter{1968 Human Rights}    

From 22 April to 12 May 1968, the world community gathered in Teheran, Iran, for the 
First World Conference on Human Rights. The event was intended to be historic. It was 
to serve as an opportunity for both reflection and looking forward. Its purpose: to mark 
the respective occasions of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Year of Human Rights, and chart a 2
new agenda for the UN human rights system, including the creation of new compliance 
mechanisms. Teheran marked a watershed moment in the history of international human 
rights.

Through its final proclamation, the conference affirmed the indivisibility of 
political and civil and economic, social and cultural rights. But it was also a missed 
opportunity to give human rights an elevated prominence within the UN system. Many
participating nations including Jamaica, marked the Conference with the issue of
commemorative postal stamps.
