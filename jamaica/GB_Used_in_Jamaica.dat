The initial consignment of stamps for Jamaica had a face value of \pound2,000 and was made up as
follows:-
\begin{verbatim}
                         £1,300 in 6d. stamps,
                            £500 in 4d. stamps and
                            £150 in 1d. stamps.
\end{verbatim}

The stamps were put on sale at the Kingston Post Office on 8th May 1858 and a reference to
this was made in a report by the Postmaster General.

A further notice was issued on the 5th June 1858, advising that stamps would only be available
at the Kingston Post office only on those days immediately proceeding the sailing of the Packet.
