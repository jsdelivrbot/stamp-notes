The post office made provisions whereby mail could be posted at the Kingston office, at the quayside or on the packet itself and charged a small fee for this service. The procedure was known as 'Late Fee' service and has been in use for many years before being officially confirmed on teh 2nd July 1868, when a rate of 3d. was stipulated
for 'late letters' posted in the special box at the post office and 6d. for those posted at the quayside or on board the packet.

On pre-stamp mail, this fee never appears on the letter as it was always prepaid by the sender or his agent and unless the letters were posted at the special late box at the Kingston office, they never received Kingston postmarks of any description. 'Late fee' letters handed to the packet agent at the quayside or on board the packet were merely stowed 'loose' in the portmanteu provided along with the bagged mail which the packet had collected at its various posrts of 
call.

RARE KINGSTON "JAMAICA/TOO LATE" C.D.S. COVER - EARLIEST RECORDED (?)

(23 Dec.) on the flap; clearly the letter just missed the November Packet and had to wait 6 weeks and more. This Too Late c.d.s. (Foster TL2; only 9 examples recorded by him) is the first type of Too Late mark recorded for Jamaica and this is the earliest example recorded. [Ex Surtees, Sept. 1976.]		Estimated Value: £200
