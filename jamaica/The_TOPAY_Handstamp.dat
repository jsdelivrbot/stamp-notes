THE UNIQUE (?) RED HANDSTRUCK SPANISH TOWN "½" COVER; 7th June 1861 EL (printed circular ref. the "Boys' Reformatory"; ink print-through from a sketch - engineering design? - on the reverse affects the address panel but well clear of the "½" mark) sent locally from Spanish Town with a superb strike of the rare Spanish Town "½" in red (PD7; unique thus - Foster only records one 4th June 1861 cover with the same contents; that could easily be the same cover, because the "7" could have been misread as "4"). This mark is thought to have been used mostly on newspapers, hence its very low survival rate.	Estimated Value: £150
Hammer Price: £220.}
