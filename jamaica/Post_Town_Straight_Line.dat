\chapter{The 'Post Town' Straight Line Handstamps}    

The first Post Town markings were modeled after the original 'JAMAICA' straight line postmarks.
As the G.P.O. records in London only record marking from 1825 onward it is very difficult to 
determine accurately as to when they were first put into use.
