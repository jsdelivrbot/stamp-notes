\chapter{Introduction}


The Pontifical State once comprised 16,000 square miles of central Italy, over which the Pope ruled as a temporal sovereign for more than a millennium. Comprising the regions of Romagna, Marche, Umbria and Lazio, it was bounded on the north by the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venice and the Duchy of Modena, on the west by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and on the southeast by the Kingdom of Naples. The population of the Pontifical State was just over 3,000,000 persons, and the government operated a highly-developed postal system that issued stamps in 1852, 1867, and 1868.

The Pontifical State collapsed during Italian unification, when General Cadorna's army invaded Rome in September 1870 and proclaimed the city as the capital of the new Italian kingdom. This launched a fifty-nine-year cold war known as the "Roman Question," during which Pope Pius IX and his successors declared themselves "prisoners in the Vatican" and sequestered themselves in the Apostolic Palace to protest the loss of their territories.
After the fall of Rome, the pontifical posts were integrated into the Italian system and Italian stamps were used on the Vatican’s mail. It was not until the Lateran Accords, signed February 11, 1929, that the Vatican and Italy formally recognized each other's right to exist and Vatican City became politically independent. Two days later, the Vatican reestablished its own post office ([Poste Vaticane](../vatican-city/Introduction)). It joined the Universal Postal Union on June 1 and signed a postal treaty with Italy on July 29, allowing Vatican mail to be routed through Rome. The first stamps were issued and the post office opened to the public on August 1, 1929. Today’s Vatican City State is the last remaining vestige of the former Pontifical State.
