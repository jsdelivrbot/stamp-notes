\chapter{Queen Makea Issues}

\section{Manufacture}

The task of engraving the dies was entrused to Mr. Alfred Ernest Cousins, an engraver with considerable reputation, who had provided dies for many of the stamps of New Zealand, Tonga and Samoa. To assist him with his works a photograph of Queen Makea was with some difficulties obtained, and the engraver was warned to "take care that Makea's likeness was not made too dark".

Cousins' first task was to engrave a steel die with a medallion showing Makea's head with the shading behind it. This after hardening was impressed on a piece of steel to form the positive matrix die, which in its turn, was impressed on five subsidiary dies, round of which Cousins engraved the appropriate frame for each of the denominations. From thee subsidiary dies were taken the moulds to form the electrotype plates, as will be described later.



Cousins took a large number of engraver's proofs during teh course of his work. In 1900, Basset Hull obtained a serie of forty-four proofs of the head die showing stages of the engraving from the inception. \footnote{A set of 44 proofs appeared in  Grosvenor Sale 35 and we presume it is the original proofs obtaine by Hull.}In 1948 more proofs were discovered and are described in The New Zealand Stamp Collector for June 1948 (Vol. XXIX, p 23). Possibly no other issue have we such an extensive record of the engraver's work. From the material available to us and from published information, we can complete the following list of Engraver's Proofs.
