\chapter{1920 Issue}

In 1920 a pictorial issue was designed and printed by Perkins, Bacon & Co, using the same vignettes but different frames for the three Cook Island stamp issuing areas. A similar design was used for Niue. The first printing was done in London, but a later printing of the \half d and 1d was made with the original plates by the Government Printer in Wellington: the London prints are all without watermark, whereas the Wellington
printings are on paper watermarked Single NZ and Star.

Note that, except for the first issue, all Cook Island and Niue stamps were also supplied to the Trade and collectors by the post offices in Wellington and Auckland. Indeed, it is thought that many of the stamps (and at least some varieties) were never sold in the Islands at all (for example, the Thief Shilling' of Niue: Tahae Sileni'
instead of Taha e Sileni'). Commercial mail was not extensive: a great many of the covers existing were sent out from other countries (particularly Great Britain) to be postmarked and returned. This particularly applied to the small islands (Figure 10).

The islands of Aitutaki and Penrhyn kept their own stamps until 1932, when all separate issues ceased, and all the islands used stamps inscribed 'Cook Islands'.
