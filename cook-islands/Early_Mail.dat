\chapter{Early Mail}

The first white residents were the Rev. John Williams and Rev. Charles Pitman, accompanied by their wives, who landed at Rarotonga on 6th May 1827. Both men were pastors of the London Missionary Society. Williams's stay was brief, but Pitman and the Rev. Aaron Buzacott (who arrived a few months later) resided there for many years. Later famous missionaries who joined them were the brothers George and William Gill; but the latter must not be confused with the Rev. William Wyatt Gill, who was a later arrival and no relation. Our knowledge of the Islands, at that period is largely due to the writings of these gentlemen.
