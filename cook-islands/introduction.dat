\chapter{Stamps and Postal History of Cook Islands}

The Cook Islands were previously known as the {{wi:Hervey_Islands}} are situated in the south pacific, in an area known as the
'middle Polynesian Triangle'. The group consists of fifteen islands that cover a landmass   of some 53 square miles.
The group is divided into the Southern (or Hervey) group, where Rarotonga is the main island, the others being Atiu, [Aitutaki](../aitutaki/introduction),
mangaia, Mauke and Mitaro. They are all volcanic islands. The atolls Takutea, Manuae and Palmerston; and the Northern Group
including Penhryn, Manihiki, Nassau, Pukapuka (Danger Island), Rakahanga, and Suwarrow, which are all atolls. 

The Cook Islands are populated by Polynesians, probably from the 'last wave' which ended up
with the Maori conquest of New Zealand.

In 1891 Mr Frederick J. Moss, who was a former planter and also a former New Zealand MP, was appointed British Resident
at Rorotonga. Moss arroved on 20 April 1891 and in co-operation with the Ariki started preparing to set up a government
and an administration. Ariki Takau Makea was appointed as Head of Government, and was known as 'Queen Makea'.

After over 50 years of internal development, the Islands were given self-government in 1965. With self-government 
philately suffered and the stamps issued since then -- described as 'jam labels' by some (LP1194.pdf) are not
particularly very interesting.
