The Cook Islands were previously known as the {{wi:Hervey_Islands}} are situated in the south pacific, in an area known as the
'middle Polynesian Triangle'. The group consists of fifteen islands that cover a landmass   of some 53 square miles.
The group is divided into the Southern (or Hervey) group, where Rarotonga is the main island, the others being Atiu, [Aitutaki](../aitutaki/introduction),
Mangaia, Mauke and Mitaro. They are all volcanic islands. The atolls Takutea, Manuae and Palmerston; and the Northern Group
including Penhryn, Manihiki, Nassau, Pukapuka (Danger Island), Rakahanga, and Suwarrow, which are all atolls. 

The Cook Islands are populated by Polynesians, probably from the 'last wave' which ended up
with the Maori conquest of New Zealand.

In 1891 Mr Frederick J. Moss, who was a former planter and also a former New Zealand MP, was appointed British Resident
at Rorotonga. Moss arrived on 20 April 1891 and in co-operation with the {{wi:Ariki}} started preparing to set up a government
and an administration. Ariki Takau Makea was appointed as Head of Government, and was known as 'Queen Makea'.

After over 50 years of internal development, the Islands were given self-government in 1965. With self-government 
philately suffered and the stamps issued since then -- described as 'jam labels' by some (LP1194.pdf) are not
particularly very interesting.


History is most often associated with European 'discoveries', and the South Sea Islands are no exception to
this rule. The Spanish explorer, Alvaro Mendafla de Neyra, discovered Pukapuka in 1595, and his pilot, Pedro
Fernandez de Quiros, found Rakahangi in 1606, but to Captain James Cook must be given the honour of the
discovery of the Cook Islands, on his second voyage, in 1773. The first island discovered was Manuae, which
was re-named Hervey Island. This island was not inhabited in the normal sense of the word, but was used as a
penal settlement by the Cook Islanders - but that is another story. Cook also sighted Palmerston (Northern
Group), Mangaia, Atiu, and Takutea (uninhabited).
Aitutaki was discovered by Captain Bligh in 1789, 17 days before he was cast adrift. It is probable that the
mutineers of the "Bounty" stood off the reef of Rarotonga some weeks later: the story of how Rarotonga had
acquired orange and pumpkin seeds before the 'official' discovery by European missionaries and British
traders in 1814 cannot be explained otherwise.
The rest of the islands were 'discovered' by missionaries of the London Missionary Soceity (LMS) in the
years after 1816. These generous souls were out to save the heathen, and once the Napoleonic Wars were ended
they were ready to begin: one aim was to convert the cannibals to Christianity, but another aim was obviously
to beat the French Catholic missionaries who were on the same track.

In the 1860s and onwards, the Islands were also invaded by traders who wanted to sell the local produce (mainly copra) and to import foreign goods: the latter were mainly alcoholic spirits, and not unnaturally the
missionaries reacted against this.
In fact, the Missionaries had done a very good job in helping the indigenous inhabitants, who were under
pressure from several foreign influences: New England whalers, traders from New South Wales, and other
religious groups. The French (as usual) tried to exert their influence and in 1 838 even tried to persuade the local
chiefs to build a Catholic Church to be run by the Jesuits. This resulted in the LMS's first attempt to have a
British Protectorate proclaimed.
At this particular stage the Cook Islands were a very loose federation led by the family clan heads, called the
'Ariki' (or chieftains), of whom there were five on Rarotonga, the Ariki Makea being rated as the chief one. The
Missionaries succeeded in a relatively short time in converting the Arikis and their dependents.
At the same time New Zealand was emerging as a potential colonial power. After the end of the Maori wars
the New Zealand Government and the Governor-General wanted to extend New Zealand rule to a number of
the Pacific islands, though at this time New Zealand was still a colony (it was not to become a dominion until
1907). A British trader, Mr C.E. Goodman, was appointed British Consul at Rarotonga in 1881. His successor,
Richard Exham, was appointed Vice-Consul in 1885, and played a much more active part in the developments leading up to the declaration of British Protectorate status in 1888.

It was a French navy vessel which triggered off this action: it had been seen approaching Rarotonga, and the
then Ariki Makea asked the British Vice-Consul to declare a British Protectorate, which he duly did on 20
September 1888. Figure 2 shows a copy of the letter from the Vice-Consul to the Marquess of Salisbury, in
which he enclosed a copy of the Proclamation.

As far as the power of the Ariki was concerned, the Ariki Takau Makea (who had been proclaimed Ariki-Nui
in 1871) had married Ngamaru Ariki, the paramount Ariki of the three islands of Atiu, Mitiaro and Mauke, and
together they controlled four out of the six inhabited islands in the Southern group. The two other islands,
Aitutaki and Mangaia, were also included in the Protectorate, but Aitutaki (the second largest island) held that
it had a special status, and that it had been accepted as a British Protectorate in its own right in 1888. For this reason the Island later had its own stamps.

331				COOK ISLANDS
THE PROTECTORATE BEGINS - CONSULAR LETTER REF. FLAG DESIGN & FLAG-RAISING ON ALL THE ISLANDS; The important 22 Sept. 1888 letter on "British Consulate, Rarotonga" paper (slight faults); the retained Cook Islands archive copy of the letter from the British Vice Consul, Sir Richard Exham to The Marquess of Salisbury written only two days after the Protectorate had been declared which contained a copy of the proclamation declaring a British protectorate and with an original pencil sketch of the proposed flag featuring stars for the islands - as featured on the first Postage Stamps. "I have also forwarded copies of the Proclamation to each of the Islands of the Group & I await the arrival of the usual yearly Man of War to proceed to each island & hoist the flag". The warship Exham was expecting was HMS Hyacinth commanded by Captain Edmund Bourke , he had already been given orders to raise the British flag, he therefore ignored what Exham had already done and raised the Union Jack on Rarotonga on 27th October 1888.

In 1891 Mr Frederick J. Moss, a former planter, and also a former New Zealand MP, was appointed British
Resident at Rarotonga. He arrived on 20 April 1891, and began to set up a form of government in co-operation
with the Ariki. Ariki Takau Makea was formally appointed as Head of Government, and was known as 'Queen
Makea'.

One of Frederick Moss's first acts was to set up a post office to handle foreign mail, and inter-island mail. For
this purpose postage stamps were needed. We know that some New Zealand stamps were used initially: at least
one cover from Moss to New Zealand is known. There was already some kind of local mail existing on
Rarotonga, and the Arikis had their own frank: Figure 3 shows a letter from Ariki Tinomana, of Arorangi, to
Richard Exham, the Vice-Consul, at Avatiu, also on Rarotonga.

On Moss's initiative the New Zealand Government agreed to supply an initial issue of postage stamps: these
were printed by the New Zealand Government printer in Wellington, in denominations of Id, IVkl, 2Vid and
lOd. This issue will be described later.

As the design of the first stamps was rather primitive, it was decided to produce a definitive set of stamps
depicting Queen Makea. This led to a certain restlessness in the other islands: two other Ariki on Rarotonga
wanted their own stamps; and so also did the Ariki of Mangaia and Aitutaki. The Federation Seal of the
Government of the Cook Islands was also criticised, for displaying a large central star (representing
Rarotonga), surrounded by six smaller stars; Figure 4 shows a cover bearing the new seal with its design of seven stars of equal size. These descendants of the Polynesian Vikings were as jealous of their pride as their
ancestors had been.
In 1897 Moss was recalled to New Zealand, having been accused of seeking dictatorial powers. He was
succeeded as Resident by Lt Col W.E. Gudgeon. In 1899 the New Zealand Premier Richard Seddon wanted to
annexe the Cook Islands to New Zealand; and he and Lord Ranfurly, the Governor of New Zealand, visited the
Islands in April 1899. There was initial resistance in the Islands to this proposal, but the next year Lord
Ranfurly paid a second visit; and on 8 October 1900 the Arikis of Rarotonga, Atiu, Mauke, Mitiaro, and
Takutea ceded their islands to Queen Victoria, followed by the Hervey Islands and Mangaia on 9 October.
Aitutaki was specifically excluded.

The following year, on 11 June 1901, the Islands (including [Aitutaki](../aitutaki/introduction), [Penrhyn](../penhryn/introduction) and [Niue](../niue/introduction)) were formally
transferred to New Zealand from Great Britain, and became New Zealand dependencies, the 'British Resident'
becoming the 'Resident Commissioner'. (Queen Makea, however, remained Chief of Government until her
death on 1 May 1911.) The annexation was commemorated by overprinting the [Queen Makea 1d](../cook-islands/1901_Issue) with a
crown.

After just over 50 years of internal development, the Islands were given self-government in 1965. This had (to
say the least) an unfavourable influence on the stamp-issuing policy. As in the 1890s, postage stamps were
regarded as an important source of revenue, and the jam labels' issued in the last 20 years are not particularly
interesting.
