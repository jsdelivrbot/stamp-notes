\section{The inverts}

The 'inverts' of the 1920 issue were first included in Gibbons' Catalogue in 1929 and those
of the 1932 issue in 1935. The total catalogue value of the seven stamps, in mint condition,
adds up to £5,100. The printers were Perkins, Bacon & Co., London.
The New Zealand Federation specifically mentions all the above, with the exception of
the Id. Cook Islands of 1932, with portrait of Captain Cook.
In connection with this matter, it is interesting to quote what appears in The Royal
Philatelic Collection by Sir John Wilson:

\begin{blockquote}
'The King and Bacon both disliked anything of questionable status.' An error of bi-colour
printing is naturally of major interest if the frame or central design is inverted, and if such stamp
has passed the checking by the printers and is sold at the Post Office, it always receives considerable
attention from stamp collectors and generally a high valuation—because printers are guilty
of very few mistakes. But if some agent, ordering the stamps, is in a position to persuade the
printers deliberately to pull one or more sheets with inverted centres, such are not errors at all
and against the interests of the collecting community. For this reason Bacon condemned all
inverted centres of the New Zealand Dependencies, Aitutaki, Niue, Penrhyn and the three such
varieties of Cook Islands, all of which were firmly deleted from the King's catalogues. He may
have been over critical but in some instances he was right. It will be understood that such
rejections were merely expressions of opinion on the part of the King and Bacon.'
\end{blockquote}

Dealing with the 1932 issue, the first mention we have found of the 1d. Captain Cook,
with inverted centre, is in the Australian Stamp Journal for August 1934. It is stated that the Philatelic Magazine illustrates one of these stamps, which has lately been discovered on an envelope, posted at Rarotonga to a London business firm, where it was torn off the envelope before the irregularity was noticed. It was sold at auction in London on June 23,
1934, for £43.

The next mention we have found is in the New Zealand Stamp Collector, for December
1935, which says '1d. COOK ISLANDS WITH INVERTED CENTRE—Investigations have
shown that one sheet . . . perf. 13, of the issue of 1932 was issued at Avarua (Rarotonga)

postal purposes and it is stated that at least seven copies in this condition franked letters to
New Zealand. According to an article which appeared in the Wellington papers, a priest
at Avarua is the fortunate owner of several copies with the inverted centre in mint
condition. . . .'

It may be significant that the mention in the N.Z.S.C. is over a year after that in the
A.S.J. and comes after the discovery had been featured in the New Zealand daily papers.
One of our members feels positive that he heard of the discovery of one example at
Valparaiso (Chile) in a cheap packet, sold to a schoolboy.

The only used example we know of is on a cover addressed to a priest at Mauke (Cook
Islands), which bears the stamp tied to the cover by the Mauke date-stamp of 6 JL 36.
The mention above of a priest being the possessor of several mint copies may have some
relation to this cover—as also that the catalogue value is higher in used condition and,
presumably, additionally so on cover. Incidentally it is the only example we have seen of a
letter addressed from Mauke to Mauke.

With regard to the 2d. (Maori Canoe), of the same issue, we can find no mention in the
stamp journals of its discovery, but only of examples being sold at auction, in singles and
once in a block of four. Gibbons' catalogue prices it in mint and used condition, and we
have seen one used example, cancelled with what appears to be the postmark current at
Rarotonga at that time. Unfortunately, the date is not visible.

The five stamps of the 1920 issue with inverted centres first appeared in the catalogue in
1926. Two printings were made of these stamps in London before the plates and dies were
sent to New Zealand and some used for printing there. The Perkins, Bacon Proof Book, in
the possession of the Royal Philatelic Society of London, has the following entries:


(at top) Cook Islands (1920) Dies and Plates (60 on) sent away. Rollers defaced or
destroyed.
(at bottom) All dies and plates sent away—Nov. 10th, 1920.
30 Plates, 60 on, all [sic] rollers destroyed 1926 [sic]. 30 dies.
As the four Dependencies had each a set of six stamps and the centres were common to
all four, the figure 30 for the number of dies tallies.
We have heard that the stamps of the 1920 issue were on sale at the New Zealand
Government office in London and that the supplies sold there were obtained direct from
the printers and not from New Zealand. Surely the Federation of N.Z. Philatelic Societies
(with their access to Government sources of information) can consult the records and make
a categorical statement of the facts. Less likely is it that they can be dogmatic as to whether
the 'inverts' were launched through this channel, although we are dealing with events which
happened within living memory and every effort should be made to sift the evidence.
Perhaps the most authoritative specialised catalogue of the stamps of the New Zealand
Dependencies is that published by Verne Collins & Co. Ltd. in 1952. The man behind this
work is Mr R. J. G. Collins, M.B.E., R.D.F., who combines the three roles of being a
philatelist cum postal historian, a stamp dealer and an author. This catalogue says of the
1920 issue: 'Varieties . . . with inverted centres come from rejected sheets. As printers waste
they should have been destroyed. They were not sent to New Zealand Post and Telegraph
Department and were certainly not issued through regular channels.'

The same catalogue lists the inverted centre of the 1d. (Capt. Cook) of 1932 and omits the
2d. (Maori Canoe) of the same issue. With regard to the former it states that one sheet was

\ph[40%]{../cook-islands/1026_161_1.jpg}{Auction: 1026 - British Empire Stamps \& Covers from the Vestey Collection 
Lot: 161 Cook Islands 1932 Pictorial Issue 2d. black and brown, perf. 13, variety centre inverted, fresh and fine unused with large part original gum. S.G. 101 var., \pound300. See S.G. footnote. Photo Estimate \pound 100-120 Sold for \pound240 }

issued at Rarotonga and 'this is the only variety of the stamps of the N.Z. Dependencies with
inverted centre which was issued through legitimate channels'.
And who can tell the world of collectors the story behind these happenings? Some
queries which occur to us may be outlined:

(1) Who made these inverted centres and how did they reach collectors?

(2) What 'pedigree' must a variety have in order to attain catalogue rank? Does it
depend upon 'legitimacy' or merely on existence ?

There is an old saying, De mortuis nil nisi bonum (Speak not ill of the dead), but surely
the fair name of our hobby is more important than the 'white-washing' of any individual—
even although he can no longer defend himself?

The acid test is this. In future international exhibitions, how is the presence or absence
of £5,000 worth of inverted centres in an entry of these New Zealand Dependencies going
to affect the judging? Must they be present in order that the collection obtains the highest
award for which the philatelic importance of these islands makes them eligible, or is their
presence or absence to be ignored in assessing the merits of the collection ?
