331				COOK ISLANDS
THE PROTECTORATE BEGINS - CONSULAR LETTER REF. FLAG DESIGN & FLAG-RAISING ON ALL THE ISLANDS; The important 22 Sept. 1888 letter on "British Consulate, Rarotonga" paper (slight faults); the retained Cook Islands archive copy of the letter from the British Vice Consul, Sir Richard Exham to The Marquess of Salisbury written only two days after the Protectorate had been declared which contained a copy of the proclamation declaring a British protectorate and with an original pencil sketch of the proposed flag featuring stars for the islands - as featured on the first Postage Stamps. "I have also forwarded copies of the Proclamation to each of the Islands of the Group & I await the arrival of the usual yearly Man of War to proceed to each island & hoist the flag". The warship Exham was expecting was HMS Hyacinth commanded by Captain Edmund Bourke , he had already been given orders to raise the British flag, he therefore ignored what Exham had already done and raised the Union Jack on Rarotonga on 27th October 1888. Significant historical item and a marvellous Page One for any Cook Islands collection. [Mentioned on page 11 and illustrated on page 12 of the RPS NZ vol. 5. Ex Burge and Paul Jensen; Cavendish 6 Dec. 2002 auction. lot 2113; realised £322.]	£300 CAV 2013 sep}
