\chapter{1892 Stamp Issues}

The first issue, that of 1892, was apparently a gift from the New Zealand Government. The design was probably
copied from the Printing Office frank of New Zealand. The original was typeset: from this original die six
moulds were made in each value, and a copper electrotype of a block of six was made from these. This
electrotype was then again used as a matrix die, and nine other blocks of six reproduced to make up the printing
sheet of 60. Each value therefore exists in six main types (Figure 5 illustrates the six types of the Id); and sub-types from the electros can also be identified.

There are two different paper shades - white and toned; but it is more difficult to distinguish them today,
owing to the ageing of the paper. Whole sheets of all values (except the lOd) were examined by Mr A.R. Burge,
the principal modern expert on the stamps of the Cook Islands.
The numbers printed were as follows:

These figures must be regarded with some suspicion. One of the reasons why Mr Moss was recalled was the
sad state of the accounts of the Post Office, and the circumstances regarding the destruction of the remainders
of the first issue. It was strongly alleged that the official number of stamps destroyed was incorrect, to say the
least.

One indication is that the stamps are not difficult to find, and that large blocks, and even sheets, still exist
Obviously the stamps were a good source of revenue to the Administration. The proper commercial use of this issue was probably not large, and it is easier to find covers franked with a complete set than covers with the proper postage rate (Figure 6).
