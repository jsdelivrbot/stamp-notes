\chapter{Margin Figures}

These are widely used in the tufte-book class. You can use it as you wish.



\begin{verbatim}
\begin{marginfigure}[15cm]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../beta/che.jpg}
  \caption{Testing}
\end{marginfigure}

\\\\[a+b\\\\]
\lorem
\end{verbatim}


\begin{marginfigure}

  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../beta/che.jpg}
  
  \caption{\protect\captionlorem}
 
\end{marginfigure}

Remember if you use any code in a `\caption` you will need to protect it using the command `\protect`. In html this has no effect and the command is ignored. 


\section{TODO}

You can also change the way the `\margifigure` css class works and have it positioned fully as a real marginfigure in the tufte-class.
