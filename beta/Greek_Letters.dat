Alpha (uppercase Α, lowercase α; Greek: Άλφα Álpha) is the first letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 1. It was derived from the Phoenician letter aleph Aleph. Letters that arose from alpha include the Latin A and the Cyrillic letter А.
In English, the noun "alpha" is used as a synonym for "beginning", or "first" (in a series), reflecting its Greek roots.[1]


\textit{Delta} (uppercase Δ, lowercase δ; Δέλτα Délta; Modern Greek [ðelta]) is the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 4. It was derived from the Phoenician letter dalet.  

Zeta (uppercase Z    Ζ, lowercase ζ; Greek: ζήτα, classical [ˈdzɛːta] or [ˈzdɛːta] zḗta, Modern Greek: [ˈzita] zíta) is the sixth letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 7. It was derived from the Phoenician letter Zayin. 


\textit{Iota} (uppercase Ι, lowercase ι; Greek: Ιωτα) is the ninth letter of the Greek alphabet. Letters that arose from this letter include the Roman I and J  and iotified letters.

\textit{Kappa} (uppercase Κ, lowercase κ or ϰ; Greek: κάππα) is the 10th letter of the Greek alphabet, used to represent the /k/ sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 20. It was derived from the Phoenician letter kaph Phoenician kaph.svg. Letters that arose from kappa include the Roman K and Cyrillic К.
Greek proper names and placenames containing kappa are often written in English with "c" due to contemporary rendering into the Latin alphabet by ancient Romans. However, transliterations of the modern Greek language invariably use the letter "k".[citation needed] Compare Κυνοσκεφαλαι, Cynoscephalae (ancient placename); κυνος κεφαλαι, kunos kephalai (phrase), meaning "dog's heads". In mathematics, the kappa curve is named after this letter; the tangents of this curve were first calculated by Barrow (17th century).

\textit{Tau} (uppercase Τ, lowercase τ; Greek: ταυ [taf]) is the 19th letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 300.

\textit{Omega} (capital: Ω, lowercase: ω; Greek Ωμέγα) is the 24th and last letter of the Greek alphabet. In the Greek numeric system, it has a value of 800. The word literally means "great O" (ō mega, mega meaning 'great'), as opposed to omicron, which means "little O" (o mikron, micron meaning "little").


\textit{Nu} /njuː/ (uppercase Ν lowercase ν, also transcribed Ny; modern Greek: Νι [ni] Ni), is the 13th letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 50. It is derived from the Phoenician letter nun.

Xi (uppercase Ξ, lowercase ξ) is the 14th letter of the Greek alphabet. It is pronounced [ksi] in Modern Greek, and generally /zaɪ/ or /saɪ/ in English.[1] In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 60. Xi was derived from the Phoenician letter samekh 
Xi is not to be confused with the letter chi, which gave its form to the Latin letter X.
