\chapter{How to Center Images}

#### By Dr. Y Lazarides

LaTeX is good with its minipages and figure environments and the `\centering` command is very powerfull. Centering a bunch of images on web pages is much harder, although if done manually and for individual images, finer control of the output is possible.

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{che.jpg}
\caption{Some Caption}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}




\section{Single Images}

Single images and their captions can be positioned centered on the page using the command `\ph`.

\ph[30%]{../beta/1.jpg}{\protect\captionlorem}

The commands `\ph`, `\ph*`  will place the image, both in the `html` as well as the `\latex` document, exactly  where it was placed.\footnote{It is just an `\includegraphics` command.} If you want to float the image, then you need to placed it in a `\figure` enironment.



\section{Multiple figures}
\begin{figure*}
\phc[30%]{../beta/1.jpg}{}
\phc[30%]{../beta/2.jpg}{Testing}
\phc[30%]{../beta/3.jpg}{Testing}
\phc[32.5%]{../beta/2.jpg}{Testing}
\phc[33%]{../beta/3.jpg}{Testing}
\clear

\phc[30%]{../beta/3.jpg}{Testing}
\phc[32.5%]{../beta/2.jpg}{Testing}
\phc[33%]{../beta/3.jpg}{Testing}
\end{figure*}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\phl[30%]{../beta/1.jpg}{A very short caption.}
\phl[30%]{../beta/2.jpg}{Testing}
\label{test}
\end{figure}

The two figure shown in \ref{test} are enclosed in a `\figure` or `\figure*` environment. For the tufte classes we also offer the `\figure*` which does not affect the way the images are displayed in the `html`, but does affect the way they are displayed in the LaTeX document.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
   \phc[3cm]{../path/to/image/img.jpg}{}
   \phc[30%]{../path/to/image/img.jpg}{}
   \phc[30%]{../path/to/image/img.jpg}{}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
