\chapter{Inline Code}


This is achieved by using \verb+\test+. This is not so convenient for html, but you can also use the markdown backtick quotes (`). We have it in case you just copying code from a LaTeX file. The code is protected during parsing so that it does not get expanded.


This is another test \verb+ \ldots \item \begin{itemize}+\ldots  

\subsection{Code Blocks in Markdown}


Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both \verb+<pre>+ and \verb+<code>+ tags.

To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input:

This is a normal paragraph:

<p>This is a normal paragraph:</p>

<pre><code>This is a code block.
</code></pre>
    
    
To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph. For example:

Use the `printf()` function.
