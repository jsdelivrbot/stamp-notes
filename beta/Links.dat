\section{Markdown Links}

The easiest way to enter links is to use markdown mark-up; \verb+[example](http://example.com)+ This is automatically changed during the LaTeX run to:


\verb+\href{http://example.com}{example}.+


The standard preamble.tex that we provide will load the hyperref package that handles urls correctly.

For printed pdfs. The link will be changed to a url.
