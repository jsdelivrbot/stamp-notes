\section{Adding captions to your figures}

If you want to add a caption, to a figure that is not in a figure environment use `\captionof` command.

\begin{verbatim}
\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{../beta/lena-full.jpg}
\captionof{figure}{\lorem}
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{../beta/lena-full.jpg}
\captionof{figure}{\lorem}

\section{Figure Numbering}

By default, figures are numbered, both in `html` as well as `LaTeX`. The feature can be turned off both in html as well as LaTeX, using the star version of the commands.

\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{../beta/lena-full.jpg}

\caption*{\lorem}
