\chapter{Footnotes}

Footnotes are an important component of good writing. They can be marked both in html or LaTeX in a similar fashion using the command:

\begin{verbatim}
\footnote{This is a footnote}.
\end{verbatim}

This is a footnote\footnote{First footnote.} and a second and third footnote\footnote{Second footnote.}\footnote{Third footnote}\footnote{Fourth}. We can also have a fifth footnote\footnote{Fifth footnote} or as many as you want.\footnote{Too many footnotes, might lower the readability of the text.\lorem }

Footnotes consist of two parts. The footnote text and the footnote mark. An in-house style, will normally specify wha type of marker to be used, for example numeric or more commonly in the humanities an alphabetic marker or roman numerals. 

See [daringfireball](http://daringfireball.net/2005/07/footnotes) for a discussion of footnotes in text.


\section{Styling Tooltips}

Default styling is via bootstrap `css`, `tooltip` classes. TeXIgniter modifies these in the `application.css` file. All components that are automatically generated by TeXIgniter have a custom class attached to it. This way, you do not have to extend base bootstrap classes, but rather define css for the custom class, eg., `.tooltip-custom`. We try very hard for you not to have to edit any code for styling.

\begin{verbatim}
.tooltip-custom + .tooltip > .tooltip-inner {
  background-color: #f00;
  display:table-row;
}
\end{verbatim}

If you do not want tooltips to be enabled, this can be set in the `footnotes.cnf` file of the plugin.

\section{Notes}

1.  When set to print footnotes using an alphabetic counter, it will represent the number based on the English alphabet.
2.  If using other languages, you will need to extend the system.
