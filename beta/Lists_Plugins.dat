# Ordinary Lists


What in `html` are termed ordinary lists, in LaTeX they are called \textit{enumerate} environments.

Available environments, `enumerate`, `loweralpha`, `upperalpha`, `lowerroman`, `decimal`, `leadingzero`.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{loweralpha}
  \item The first line.
  \item The second line.
\end{loweralpha}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{loweralpha}
  \item The first line.
  \item The second line.
\end{loweralpha}


\begin{verbatim}
\begin{upperalpha}
  \item The first line.
  \item The second line.
\end{upperalpha}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{upperalpha}
  \item The first line.
  \item The second line.
\end{upperalpha}

\begin{decimal}
  \item The first line.
  \item The second line.
\end{decimal}

\begin{upperroman}
  \item The first line.
  \item The second line.
\end{upperroman}

\begin{lowerroman}
  \item The first line.
  \item The second line.
\end{lowerroman}



## CSS 

The cascade Style Sheets are in `application.css`, check it out and experiment with your code. All environments have a respective css class with the name of the environment but hyphenated i.e., `upper-roman`.
