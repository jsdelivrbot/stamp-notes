\chapter{Code Editor}

I have experimnted quite a bit with CodeMirror, but sadly had to let go. We are now using ACE, as it has proven to be much more robust and I am quite satisfied with the wrapping function which is important, if the user is typing a lot of text. I also think that it has a good commercial backing, in addition to the open community and can only be improved with time.
