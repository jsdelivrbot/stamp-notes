# Mapping localhost to another domain


## Step 1: Set up `etc/hosts/`

etc/hosts is a file present on every operating system. On Windows, it’s in `C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/`, on OS X and Linux it’s in `/etc/hosts`. Edit it as an administrator (one easy way to do this is to run a text editor like Sublime Text as Administrator) and add in an entry like this for every application you intend to develop:

\begin{verbatim}
192.168.10.10 homestead.app
\end{verbatim}

Replace homestead.app with your desired domain name, or just add in multiple domain names. For example, I have this in my own hosts file:

\begin{verbatim}
192.168.10.10 stampcircles.com
192.168.10.10 other.app
192.168.10.10 stampcircles.application-latest
\end{verbatim}

This means I can access each of these domains in the browser via http://stampcircles.com, or http://test1.app, etc.

You need to restart the server to see the effect.

Remapping is a good idea, as you may pick up areas where you hardcoded localhost!
