\chapter{Blockquotes}    

For discussion on the semantics of `blockquote` and `cite` elements there
is a very good article on [blockquote](http://html5doctor.com/blockquote-q-cite/) and cite t the html5doctor website. 

\begin{blockquote}[]  Blockquotes tend to appear more in webpages rather than books, where normal
quotations are used. Translating them to TeX normally they will be printed
in a more plain style, although we provide a number of them with rather more
fancy typesetting.

\end{blockquote}


If you omit the optional bracket you need to make sure you terminate the expression
with a blank space (although it might work without the space).

\begin{blockquote}[shadow]
 \lorem 
\end{blockquote}

\begin{blockquote}[custom]
 \lorem 
\end{blockquote}

\begin{blockquote}[]
   Fourth empty bracket \lorem 
\end{blockquote}

\beginblockquote    
  
\salutation{Dear John}

 A  \lorem 

\endblockquote




\salutation{Dear John}
