# CSS

TeXIgniter uses numerous files for CSS

\begin{description}
\item[bootstrap] We start with a basic `bootstrap` css file, which we then overwrite in certain places
to render the pages. A better theming and workflow will be developed later and its on the cards.
\item[flag-icons] `flag-icons.css`
\end{description}


All CSS files are located at the `assets` folder. This still needs a lot of clean-up to remove anything we do not use at the moment.

## Flags

We use flags to display country flags. The images are in svg format and located in `assets/flags`.
