# Annotations

## Web annotations

The system allows you to annotate any paragraph, or image using "AnnotateIt". This is to improve on co-operative writing.

## PDF Annotations

The annotations can be configured to be included in the pdf. This is done automatically, in draft mode. For final mode, these are automatically excluded. To set it, use the
document, settings key.
