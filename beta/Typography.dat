\section{Fonts}

The `html` rendering fonts are handled purely by the CSS. For TeX they are handled via the `preable.tex` file or your own version. \verb++ \test ++

\section{Highlighting, Bold, Italic and Underlining}

You can \textit{this is in italics} and you can have \textsc{smallcaps.} and \lorem. You can also have \textbf{bold.} and proper ellipses \ldots.

\begin{verbatim}
\lettrine{T}{his is the typography} class.

Dashes Example
-------  

We provide emdashes (---) endashes (--) and dashes (-). 

----

\end{verbatim}

This renders as follows:

\begin{blockquote}
<hr/>
\section{Dashes Example}
 

We provide emdashes (---) endashes (--) and dashes (-). 

<hr/>
\end{blockquote}

For LaTeX we leave as is, as the TeX engine can handle the dashes on its own quite well. The sectioning command i.e, 5-dashes or more is translated automatically by the application to a section. Note if you want the optional part of a `section` then rather use, \verb+\section[]{..}+.
