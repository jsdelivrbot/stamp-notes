\chapter{LaTeX Style Tables Plugin}

Tables in LaTeX are substantially different from the way tables are rendered in html, hence a way to handle them and finding meanigful and user friendly way to handle them both ways, is albeit difficult. We will demonstrate these techniques, from plain vanilla
tables to more complicated ones.

\section{Introduction}

Our aim is to enhance both the TeX, as well as the HTML experience of the user, so this plugin has numerous utilities.

Firstly in `htlm` all TeX code is ignored and translated to its equivalent mark-up code.
The markup
`   \begin { table }[...] ...
    \end{ table }`
is just ignored, as there are no need to float any tables typeset in a continuous page. For LaTeX they will have their usual meaning.


\section{Simple Tables}

A simple table in LaTeX is marked as per the listing below. A tabular alone can be typeset by omitting the \verb++ \begin{table}...\end{table}++.

\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{table}[htbp]
   \centering
   \begin{tabular}{lll}
     1 & 2 & 3\\
   \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
\end{verbatim}

In html a table has in many ways got a more complicated structure. The only use for the table command is to set an enclosing environment for captions, centering and sizing.



\begin{table}[htbp]
   \centering
   \tablecaption{testing}
   \begin{tabular}{llllp{3.5cm}}
    a & b & c & d & Some remarks\\   
    e & f & g & h &\\ 
    e & f & g & h & This is some long test.
   \end{tabular}
   
   \begin{center}
   
   \end{center}
\end{table}



\begin{table}[htbp]
   \centering
   \tablecaption{Icelanding Air Mails}
   \begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{5.5cm}}
    \textbf{1928} &     &\\
    June & 4th & \'Reykjavik-Isafjordur-Siglufjord-Akureyi.\\   
    June & 5th & Akureyi-Reykjavic (Plane forced down near Akrar)\\
    June & 9th & Reykjavik-Vestmannaeyjar and return.\\
    June &26-28th & Reykjavik-Seydisfjordur-Stykkisholmur-Hornafordur\\
    \textbf{1929} & & \\
    July &3-4th   &Reykjavik-Saudarkrokur-Siglufjordur-Akureyri-Husavjk-Thorshofn-
                   Seysisfjordur-Nordfjordur-Reydarfjordur\\
    July &6th     &Reykjavik-Bildudalur-Isafjordur\\
    
    July &9th     &Reykjavik-Ivigut (Greenland) by Captain Ahrenberg.\\
    July &31st    &Reykjavik-Stykkisholmur-Reykjavik.\\
    
    \textbf{1930} & & \\
    
    June &27-29th &Reykjavik-Thingvellir Millenary Service.  \\
    October &30th &Dyrafirdi-Blonduos-Holmavik-Onundarfjordur-Reykjavik.\\
    & \multicolumn{2}{l}{This is a two column multicolumn left justified} \\
    
    & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{This is a two column multicolumn centered} \\
    June &27-29th &Reykjavik-Thingvellir Millenary Service.  \\  
    
    & \multicolumn{2}{|r|}{This is a two column multicolumn right justified} \\
   \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Multicolumns}

Multicolumns are marked in the same way as LaTeX with the exception that an additional specifier, specifying a class can be optionally inserted \verb+\multicolumn{2}{c,centered}{text}+. This is removed during the LaTeX run.

\begin{verbatim}

\begin{table}[htp]
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\centering
cell-1 &\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{These are three multicolumn  cells}  &cell-5\\
cell-1 &\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{These are two multicolumn  cells}   &cell-4 &cell-5
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\end{verbatim}

Will render as:

\begin{table}[htp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
cell-1 &\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{These are three multicolumn  cells}  &cell-5\\
cell-1 &\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{These are two multicolumn  cells}   &cell-4 &cell-5
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
