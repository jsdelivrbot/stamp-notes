\chapter{LaTeX Style Tables Plugin}

Tables in LaTeX are substantially different from the way tables are rendered in html, hence a way to handle them and finding meanigful and user friendly way to handle them both ways, is albeit difficult. We will demonstrate these techniques, from plain vanilla
tables to more complicated ones.

\section{Simple Tables}

A simple table in LaTeX is marked as per the listing below. A tabular alone can be typeset by omitting the \verb++ \begin{table}...\end{table}++.

\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{table}[htbp]
   \centering
   \begin{tabular}{lll}
     1 & 2 & 3\\
   \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
\end{verbatim}

In html a table has in many ways got a more complicated structure. The only use for the table command is to set an enclosing environment for captions, centering and sizing.



\begin{table}[htbp]
   \centering
   \tablecaption{testing}
   \begin{tabular}{llllp{3.5cm}}
    a & b & c & d & Some remarks\\   
    e & f & g & h &\\ 
    e & f & g & h & This is some long test.
   \end{tabular}
   
   \begin{center}
   
   \end{center}
\end{table}



\begin{table}[htbp]
   \centering
   \tablecaption{testing}
   \begin{tabular}{llllp{3.5cm}}
    a & b & c & d & Some ver very lond remarks we will get it to wrap.\\   
    
   \end{tabular}
   
   
\end{table}
