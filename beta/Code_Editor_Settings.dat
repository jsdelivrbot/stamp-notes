$$\sum a+\frac{b}{c} = \frac{52}{x}$$


I have experimnted quite a bit with CodeMirror, but sadly had to let go. We are now using ACE, as it has proven to be much more robust and I am quite satisfied with the wrapping function which is important, if the user is typing a lot of text. I also think that it has a good commercial backing, in addition to the open community and can only be improved with time.

\section{Settings for the Code Editor}

How much should one give the user control here? Personally I don't think much, except for the user that will install a totally new Project. 

In this case, possibly a hard pressed serf like a PhD student it is quite likely that they will want to use more, as they will be expected to be typing quite a bit.

Anyway this can be left for a future release.
