2.14.9.3 LEOs on the front of the controller shall display the following status information : program
running, watchdog timer timed-out, and power supply on.



<span style="width:50px;font-weight:bold">2.14.10</span> Common Features

<span style="width:50px;font-weight:bold">2.14.10.1</span>The only difference between the range of fixed inpuUoutput controllers and the modular
controller is that they provide a controller with fewer hardware inputs and outputs. They
shall use the same engineering tools and communications software to ensure total
compatibility with all the other controllers on the system.

{{pinnote: Please ensure that the above is complied with}}


2.14.10.2 Both types shall be compatible with the same operator terminal as the modular controller so
that data may be read from any controller.

2.14.10.3 These small controllers shall also offer the same standard software capabilities as
described in the Standard Software Functionality section.

2.14.10.4 The CPUs shall have, as a minimum a 16-bit microprocessor with a clock speed of 10 MHz.
They shall have at least 512 Kbytes of RAM with the application program stored in 128
Kbytes of flash EEPROM. No battery back-up shall be necessary; instead a maintenancefree
solution such as a Goldcap capacitor shall provide 72-hour back-up power for the
RAM.

2.14.10.5 An RS232 port shall provide local and remote access to all data in the controller to which it
is connected as well as to other controllers on the same communication bus.

2.14.10.6 The internal power supply shall provide all power sources necessary for the complete
operation of the contro ller. It shall incorporate a watchdog timer with potential-free relay
contacts to provide remote alarm indication.

2.14.10.7 The combination of analog and digital points as inputs and outputs shall be optimized to suit
the application for which the controller is being used.

2.14.10.8 While it shall be possible to use supplier-specific analog inputs, the facility shall also exist
for industry-standard inputs, e.g. 0 to 10 Vdc, 0 to 20mA, 4 to 20 mA, NTC 20K ohm,
PT100, PT1000, PT3000. Any combination of analog input types must be possible. The
resolution shall be 12-bil.

2.14.10.9 Analog inputs may be used in place of digital inputs except when a pulsed input from a
utility meter is connected . In this situation only a pure digital input shall be used.
