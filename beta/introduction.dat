To not to have entirely wasted one's life seems to be a worthy accomplishment, if only for myself.

I have developed this application for my own use, as most existing systems did not offer what I wanted. TeX mark-up has survived over 30 years and is currently the \textit{de facto} method for preparing scientific papers. Although a browser can be used to render a pdf, web publishing is a different art.

{{nutshell: This application will convert mark-up to what I believe better rendering. }}

Another advantage of using the browser as a front to LaTeX, is it can provide a better interface than most editors and at the same time assist with manuscript development.

If you are typing a long manuscript, you will eventually break it into parts and then combine the parts before rendering the full document. This workflow is captured in the application. 


\section{Mark-up}

The strength of the application is its mark-up language. Before embarking on a diatrebe on the goodness or not or the various schemes, I took into account the possible users of this CMS, who I expect to be from the every young student to a retired philatelist. Mark-up is offered in two flavors, in its simplest form is based on Markdown and all markdown mark-up should work. Markdown limits you in what you can typeset in the same way that \latex is limited if you only want to use the base classes such as `book`.

\section{Math}

When \\(a \ne \\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$


2.14.9.3 LEOs on the front of the controller shall display the following status information : program
running, watchdog timer timed-out, and power supply on.



<span style="width:50px;font-weight:bold">2.14.10</span> Common Features

<span style="width:50px;font-weight:bold">2.14.10.1</span>The only difference between the range of fixed inpuUoutput controllers and the modular
controller is that they provide a controller with fewer hardware inputs and outputs. They
shall use the same engineering tools and communications software to ensure total
compatibility with all the other controllers on the system.

{{pinnote: Please ensure that the above is complied with}}


2.14.10.2 Both types shall be compatible with the same operator terminal as the modular controller so
that data may be read from any controller.

2.14.10.3 These small controllers shall also offer the same standard software capabilities as
described in the Standard Software Functionality section.

2.14.10.4 The CPUs shall have, as a minimum a 16-bit microprocessor with a clock speed of 10 MHz.
They shall have at least 512 Kbytes of RAM with the application program stored in 128
Kbytes of flash EEPROM. No battery back-up shall be necessary; instead a maintenancefree
solution such as a Goldcap capacitor shall provide 72-hour back-up power for the
RAM.

2.14.10.5 An RS232 port shall provide local and remote access to all data in the controller to which it
is connected as well as to other controllers on the same communication bus.

2.14.10.6 The internal power supply shall provide all power sources necessary for the complete
operation of the contro ller. It shall incorporate a watchdog timer with potential-free relay
contacts to provide remote alarm indication.

2.14.10.7 The combination of analog and digital points as inputs and outputs shall be optimized to suit
the application for which the controller is being used.

2.14.10.8 While it shall be possible to use supplier-specific analog inputs, the facility shall also exist
for industry-standard inputs, e.g. 0 to 10 Vdc, 0 to 20mA, 4 to 20 mA, NTC 20K ohm,
PT100, PT1000, PT3000. Any combination of analog input types must be possible. The
resolution shall be 12-bil.

2.14.10.9 Analog inputs may be used in place of digital inputs except when a pulsed input from a
utility meter is connected . In this situation only a pure digital input shall be used.
