# SVG Images

SVG images are important in both publications as well as LaTeX produced documents. TeX in itself cannot handle SVG and hence they need to be inserted as specials.

For the web, scaling them can present problems. A good reference for scaling them as backgrounds is [Scaling SVG images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Scaling_of_SVG_backgrounds) at mozilla. One has still to worry about outdated IE browsers, so be careful. They might also not work well in some mobiles.


## Including SVG files in LaTeX runs

These will have first to be converted to pdfs in order to preserve the advantages of scalable vector graphics.

For help for including the images in LaTeX at [TX.SX](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/2099/how-to-include-svg-diagrams-in-latex). There is also a [guide](../http://ctan.um.ac.ir/info/svg-inkscape/InkscapePDFLaTeX.pdf) at CTAN.


## Examples

The menuing application uses country flags.

\begin{verbatim}
<ul>
<li><a href="../abu-dhabi/Introduction"><i class="flag-icon flag-icon-ae"></i> United Arab Emirates</a>
<li><a href="../abu-dhabi/Introduction"><i class="flag-icon flag-icon-ao"></i> Angola</a>
</ul>
\end{verbatim}

This will render as:


<ul>
<li><a href="../abu-dhabi/Introduction"><i class="flag-icon flag-icon-ae"></i> United Arab Emirates</a>
<li><a href="../abu-dhabi/Introduction"><i class="flag-icon flag-icon-ao"></i> Angola</a>
</ul>
