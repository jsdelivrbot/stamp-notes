# Approaches to Menus

It was always my intention to offer the user, multiple ways of developing
menus. In a CMS or blog like Wordpress or Drupal the user has the option to sort out menus, based on categories, or a timed based approach. They all work, but is a bit different here as we need to provide a more detailed choice.

## What type of menus

-  We have menus that list all the sections of a book for LaTeXing.
-  We have sidemenus to help the user navigate the pages.
-  We have the basic website navigation.
-  We have drop downs to help categorize the content.
-  We have footer menus.
-  We can provide menus in the form of contents for a single page as Wikipedia does.
-  Custom menus.

There is a good discussion, how to automate and maintain menus at [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dynamic-dropdowns/), there are many choices:

\begin{itemize}
\item Hard code them in the html. This is the best choice when there is no need to automate the process.
\item Storing them in files, from simple text files, json or yaml.
\item Storing them in a database. This is by far the most flexible method, especially if one has to use the information in other areas. 
\end{itemize}
