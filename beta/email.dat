# Setting Up to send and receive emails.


## Set an account with a Mail Provider

This section gave me a lot of headaches, as we need to 

a) cater for local testing and 

b) either setting-up a mail server or 

c) using one of the mail services (preferred such as mailchimp, etc).

An idea is to also think of using Parse that can cater for mobile applications. A lot of work here.
