# Connecting to Your EC2 Instance Using Putty

For Windows users it is always somewhat of a challenge to connect to an EC2 instance using SSH, as SSH support does not come natively with Windows.

At this stage you should have created your server at AWS. We also need some more prerequisites which I list below:

\begin{itemize}
\item [Install Putty]. Install the full set of Putty files which you can find here.

\item Set Putty in your path. This is not really necessary but you can avoid typing in long paths to execute Putty command line programs.

\item Install WinSCP http://winscp.net/eng/download.php a good tutorial can be found at http://support.suso.com/supki/SSH_Tutorial_for_Windows.

\item [Get the ID of the Instance] Get the ID of the instance
You can get the ID of your instance using the Amazon EC2 console (from the Instance ID column). If you prefer, you can use the describe-instances (AWS CLI) or ec2-describe-instances (Amazon EC2 CLI) command.
Get the public DNS name of the instance
You can get the public DNS for your instance using the Amazon EC2 console (check the Public DNS column; if this column is hidden, click the Show/Hide icon and select Public DNS). If you prefer, you can use the describe-instances (AWS CLI) or ec2-describe-instances (Amazon EC2 CLI) command.

\item [Locate the private key]
You'll need the fully-qualified path of the .pem file for the key pair that you specified when you launched the instance.
Enable inbound SSH traffic from your IP address to your instance
Ensure that the security group associated with your instance allows incoming SSH traffic from your IP address. For more information, see Authorizing Network Access to Your Instances.

\begin{danger}
Important
Your default security group does not allow incoming SSH traffic by default.
\end{danger}

\end{itemize} 

## Using Putty

Now that we have installed all the prerequisites we start PuTTY using the __Start__ menu.
