Blocks are only used to call attention; they are useful in instructional books and common in webpages, where the user normally scans rather than reads.

{{pinnote: Don't forget about something!}}

\pinnote{This was done using a LaTeX command}

If you only want them on the webpage, use the wiki-style commands, i.e `{{function:  }}`


\subsection{Nutshell Block}

{{nutshell: Don't forget about something!}}

If you want them to appera in both use `\ nutshell{..}` or other similar commands.

\nutshell{This is using \ nutshell.}


They are highly customizable via CSS (each command has its own class, as well as via LaTeX commands, which they can be overwritten). For example to customize `nutshell` you will need to both customize the CSS as well as the LaTeX command `\nutshell`
