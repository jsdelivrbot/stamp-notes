In the late nineteeth century mails only reached Kampala once a month from Great Britain taking on average
three months to get there. G. Wilson, who was an official with B.E.A Co.'s territory prior to his
transfer as deputy Commissioner for Uganda in 1896 was the first to attempt any organised postal service in Uganda.

There was no such thing as a printing press in the Colony and Wilson consulted the Rev.E.Millar, C.M.S. who typed
some sheets of stamps each containg various values from 5 to 100 {{wi:cowries}}.

Robson Lowe notes that Millar in his diary under date march 14th 1895 writes: 
<blockquote>
At lunch-time Wilson
looked in and wanted us to help him with his idea of a postage system in Uganda. I consented to print
some stamps for him and printed him off a sheet of all values _from 10 to 50 shells_. 
</blockquote>

This proved that this first 
printing did not include all the values (the full set goes as high as 200c.

The regular mail which Wilson organised began on March 20th 1895 and according to a notice which was posted up four days earlier
there were some seventeen places which were to receive a post from kampala, some daily and some every two to three days, and all
at least once a fortnight. 

In 1896 the control of the mails was taken over by the O.C.Military Forces.

By 1897 the demand for stamps had so incraesed that it was necessary they should be printed, and the C.M.S. having by then acquired a small printing
press, their production was undertaken by the rev. F, Rowling, who set up the type and had the sheets pulled off by a _native boy_.


###Missionary typewritten Stamps 1895 (March 20)

These stamps were typewritten by the Rev. E.Millar, C.M.S. on sheets of 117-9x13, wide stamps and sheets of 143-11x13, narrow stamps.

###The 'L' Overprint of 1896
The reason for this overprint is not known although some authorities state that it was used to signify that they
were for local use only. This would be a needless distinction as those without the overprint did not even make
it to B.E.A. Further if it was only for local use why overprint the 5 Rupees?

##1902 B.E.A. Nos 69 and 72 Overpinted with 'UGANDA'

In 1902 two British east Africa Stamps were overprinted with uganda and used in Uganda, the 1/2 anna and the 2 1/2 annas.
Varieties exist and are well sought after. Inverted, double and overprint omitted once in pair. Covers are worth from three times
the stamps and blocks from four times.

Generally Ugandan stamps are difficult to come by and not very popular with collectors for this reason.
