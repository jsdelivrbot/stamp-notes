Lot: 479 Uganda Unknown date, typographed "uganda/i shell" rouletted label in blue with illustration of goose and palm trees at centre; thins and other faults though rare and most unusual. Photo Estimate £ 100-120 Note: Little is known about this label though it has been suggested that the White Fathers, who were in Uganda at the turn of the century, had a small supply of these stamps printed in middle Europe, possibly Austria, but that in the meantime the Typewritten stamps were made by the Protestant Missionaries. The above label was found in Uganda by Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen when he was serving there. As his family were stamp collectors he placed it is his diary where it remained for many years. During the 1940s it was shown by Col. Meinerzthagen to Robson Lowe who subsequently illustrated in Volume II of his Encyclopaedia Sold for £200.}
