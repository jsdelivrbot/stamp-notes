\chapter{Early Mail}

In 1876 Colonel Gordon, the Governor General, had annexed the northern portion of
{{wi: Unyoro}} now known as Bunyoro, namely the provinces of Shifalu and mangungo, enclosed by the bend of the Nile and lake Albert, and as far south as the latititude of Mruli. Gordon remained in the Gondokoro provinces until October 1876. He had succeeded in establishing a line of way stations from the Sobat confluence on the White Nile to the frontier of Uganda, where he proposed to open a route from Mombasa. In 1874 he built the station at Dufile on the Albert Nile to reassemble steamers carried there past rapids for the exploration of Lake Albert. Considerable progress was made in the suppression of the slave trade.  However, Gordon had come into conflict with the Egyptian governor of Khartoum and Sudan. The clash led to Gordon informing the Khedive that he did not wish to return to the Sudan and he left for London. Ismail Pasha wrote to him saying that he had promised to return, and that he expected him to keep his word. Gordon agreed to return to Cairo, and was asked to take the position of Governor-General of the entire Sudan, which he accepted.

Sale: 657
Lot: 265				VERY EARLY COVER FROM "GONDOKORO" WRITTEN \& SIGNED BY COL. C.G. GORDON, HIMSELF; Fine 9 Sept. 1874 letter and long env. (latter with faults to right of address, possibly associated with carriage in the famous cleft-stick of the native runners), written \& signed by "Chinese" Gordon and sent by native messenger to "Mr. [Carl] G[i]egler, Director of Telegraphs, Khartoum". Gordon had only been appointed "Governor General of the Equator" earlier in 1874, and his staff had rapidly been decimated by malaria on arrival in Uganda; his own nephew, Willy Anson, succombed (in the arms of Gordon's right-hand man, Romolo Gessi) and this letter relates to the sale of his effects. The original "Inventory of Mr. Anson's things" is still present; it lists such vital items as:- "12 Towels, 29 Shirts (assorted)...4 Neckties, 12 Cuffs...3 Tooth brushes...2 Puggeries [what?]...1 Pillow, 1 Mosquito Curtain...3 Pr of Shooting boots...", etc. Gordon asks the addressee to forward an enclosed letter and to sell the contents of "three boxes and a bag" of Anson's effects that were sent along with this letter. He also enclosed "an order on Ali Effendi for the payment of the sum of 147 shells(?)", and the flap of the envelope is endorsed (in German; presumably by the addressee) "Aly Effendi got the order to pay you the amount". Extremely rare early letter from what was to become Uganda, associated with this most famous man. [Purchased by Private Treaty in April 1975.]		Estimated Value: £750

Lot: 266				RARE EARLY LETTER FROM UP-COUNTRY UGANDA, WRITTEN \& SIGNED BY COL. C.G. GORDON HIMSELF; Fine 9 Jan. 1876 env.
