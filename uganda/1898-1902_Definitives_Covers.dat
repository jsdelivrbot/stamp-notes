\chapter{1898-1902 Definitives Covers}

Until Uganda joined the UPU on 1 September 1901, mail to UPU member countries required additional franking from British East Africa. From November 1898, when Uganda Queen Victoria stamps were issued, until 1 September 1901, covers franked with the issues of both Uganda and British East Africa were possible. Although the Imperial Penny Postage had been implemented in British East Africa news had not reached Uganda when the above cover was posted, thus this single rate cover was franked at the 4a. external rate for Uganda and 2½a. for BEA.
