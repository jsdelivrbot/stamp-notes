\chapter{Typeset Issue}


\section{Background}

During 1895 two events of major importance had taken place on the coast. On 30 June the
IBEA Company had thrown in the sponge and the following day British East Africa
became a Protectorate. In November it joined the UPU. In May 1896 the first rails of the
Uganda Railway were laid from {{wi:Kilindini}}.

It was some time before the repercussions of such momentous events were felt in Uganda.
In September 1896 John Ainsworth, HM Sub-Commissioner at Machakos, started making
arrangements with the Postmaster, T. E. C. Remington, to develop the existing runner
service (Mombasa to Kikuyu) into a full postal service. By Christmas both Machakos and
Kikuyu had been supplied with stamps and cancellers, and Kikuyu thus acquired UPU
status. A new station had meanwhile been established in the no-man's-land between the
Protectorates at Eldama Ravine, and in the new Eastern Province of Uganda Mumias
had become a station. Forts were planned along the runner road to protect it from the
hostile Nandi (until now mails had gone by caravan or escorted, not by lone mail runners).
In 1896 the first Government importation of rupees into Uganda took place, though
cowries continued to circulate until 1901 (when they were banned).

\section{Through Government Mails}

A local edict from Port Alice (a short-lived name for Entebbe), sent on 30 September 1896
to district officers, reads:

\begin{blockquote}[shadow]

'The establishment of a regular mail with the coast at the expense of the administration
having made it necessary that steps should be taken to secure legitimate revenue against
expenditure incurred, I have to request that you will make known the enclosed notice to
the officials and to the public generally who use the mail at your station, and to take the
necessary measures to obtain payment according to the scale fixed. In your own case,
and in that of other officers or officials serving at your station, the amount should be included in each officer's private account, and settled once a month. You will observe
that a charge is made for letters and papers, as well as for books and parcels, but, pending
any fresh instructions, the charge on books and parcels only is to be made from persons
in the service of the Protectorate.'

\end{blockquote}

The schedule with it gives the rates:

The reader should perhaps be reminded that Uganda was administratively quite separate
from BEA and had no proper postmaster to take it into the UPU. The authorities at
Mombasa (where Remington was an absentee PMG, since he held from 1895 to 1899
jointly the post of PMG in both BEA and Zanzibar Protectorates and resided at Zanzibar)
were not anxious to saddle themselves with any responsibility for Uganda's mails.

\section{Transition Period}

It would seem that in Uganda no advance provision had been made for stamps in the new
currency, but by the end of October a new issue was commissioned. One cover has survived
which marks the transition period, in which payment in annas to Kikuyu is acknowledged
in manuscript initialled by Millar. This can have operated for only one or at most two mails,
and the cover is probably unique.

Missionary Printing Facilities
Once again the missions were asked to come to the rescue. They had had a small printingpress
for some time, which (as we have seen above) was transferred from Mengo to Luba's
in May 1895. Baskerville notes in his journal on 2 June 1895 that Crabtree had written
'That he is busy fixing up the printing-press at Luba's'. On 28 August Rowling at Luba's
sent to UK an order for type required as soon as possible, as he had now got a printingpress
from Mengo.
On 27 March 1896 Rowling reports that 'the new press has arrived from Uganda [Luba's
was in Usoga]. It is very rusty and some of the accessories have been spoiled by water'

(including the blanket, we are told elsewhere). At the Finance Committee meeting of
29 June, 'Mr Rowling was authorised to engage a boy to assist in printing'. The press was
placed at the CMS house at Bukaleba, outside the fort of Luba's.
Frank Rowling devised the stamps with the type he had to hand, and a specimen sheet
(or sheet of each value?) was submitted to the authorities in Kampala; after approval on
31 October the first printing was put in hand by Rowling and his boy.

\section{The Stamps}

Sixteen individual stamps of the same value were set up in type in a pane. Elements of the
design - the frame and the inscription - were to be constant for all seven values: 1, 2, 3, 4
and 8 annas, 1 and 5 rupees. All had to be printed in black. In order to make forgery mmore
difficult and differentiation of values easier, different combinations of ornaments were
used. To make optimum use of the paper available and because of the way the paper was fed, one pane was printed on the sheet, the paper was then turned and a second pane
printed, with a resultant sheet of thirty-two stamps in which two panes appear tete-beche,
We know from Rowling's own evidence that sixteen was the most he could set at one
time from the limitation of his type, and even to do this he had to make a few minor compromises.
The most obvious is the small 'O' in POSTAGE in Position 9, though whether
this is of a different point size from the same fount or a 'wrong-fount' letter from the old
press is difficult to tell. The second 'A' in UGANDA in Position 4 seems to me faulty,
rather than small (as listed in the Robson Lowe Encyclopaedia), but it could also be from
the wrong fount.

With the exception of the 5 rupees there were two printings of all the values from the
same type. The 1, 2, 3, and 4 annas were printed on thick white wove paper (hymn-sheets),
and the 8as and R1 and R5 on thin yellowish note paper. The stamps were again imperforate
and ungummed, save for a few sheets which Rowling gummed before leaving Uganda for
his trip home.

The first printing was completed and sent to the Government for issue on 7 November
1896, and consisted of 29,000 stamps, with a total value of a little over 12,000 rupees.
The second printing, completed 2 July 1897, consisted of 30,000 stamps, all values except
the 5 rupees.

The information in the last three paragraphs was elicited by Skipwith. There is no reason
to doubt this information 'from the horse's mouth', but it does seem very remarkable that,
with such a shortage of type, the setting could be left 'standing' for eight months. Yet one
doubts still more whether it can have been distributed and re-set so accurately.

\section{The Printings}

By further study of the stamps themselves, from work done by Stonehill and never published
but implicit in descriptions and illustrations in the sale catalogue of his collection, and by inferences from the archives, we can make a few deductions.

In the first printing the type was arranged on the bed so that it printed longways on the
paper, with the result that the two panes were one above the other. Possibly owing to the
damage to the blanket, the impression of the stamps thus vertically arranged is relatively
light, giving a clean but greyish appearance. 

In the second printing, where the type has been
turned through 90 degrees and the panes are thus side by side, the impression is heavier,
giving a blacker appearance. This is more apparent on whole panes or sheets, but variations
of inking could make it not wholly reliable for single stamps.

S.G. 55, 55a, £760+ Estimate £ 180-200 Sold for £280.}

The various pointers to the above conclusions may be stated. We know that some of the
first printing were overprinted 'L' but that the practice was discontinued. The 'thin 1' was
overprinted 'L', while the commoner 'thick 1' was not; therefore the 'thin 1' was of the
first printing. 'Thin 1' sheets are always lightly impressed. Tete-beche blocks of 'L' overprints
are 'head to tail'. In vertically arranged sheets in Position 14 the 'O' in PROTECTORATE
is unbroken, whereas in the horizontal sheets it is broken.

The tall thin 1 can be identified (by proof copies of printed tracts in the archives) as from
the fount of the first printing-press, so one may deduce that the correct 1 s were damaged
or lost and later replaced, or late in arriving.

To have lifted out the figures and emblems for each value, replaced them, and locked up
the type again for seven values in the first printing and six values in the second without
producing any more varieties than those that were perforce constant, and only minor
displacements of the vertical and horizontal rules, would be commendable in the trade-
union regulated conditions of modern Luton, but to have done it with one native boy in
the wilds of nineteenth century Uganda is little short (appropriately) of miraculous.
Errors
Two copies only are known (both discovered by Stonehill and plated by him to Position 15)
of the 3 annas with 'dagger reversed'. It must be assumed, I think, unless others turn up,
that these were on a trial sheet submitted for approval and were forthwith corrected. It
would be good to know where they are now: fortunately they were photographed for the
sale catalogue.
The same source provided the only evidence seen for another error: viz, the 8 annas
printed on the thick white paper instead of the thin yellowish. Are there thirty-one others
floating about unrecognised?

\section{Changes of rate}

A few changes of rate were promulgated in May 1897, as under. It is by no means certain that
other changes were not made, particularly in regard to parcels. Coast mail at this time could
go only the one way, so the rate 'to Kikuyu' applied equally to any destination, British or
foreign.

\section{'L' Overprint}

A large and ugly 'L' was handstamped by the Collector at Kampala on sheets of all values
from the first printing. It has always been supposed that these were intended for local
mails, to ensure that these did not get bagged with the coast mails. In default of contemporary
evidence, the explanation cannot be refuted, but the half-dozen or so recorded
covers suggest that any such use soon ceased. It hardly seems to have been a necessary aid
to sorting. However, it is clear from a study of FO correspondence on the Estimates that a ;
proportion of the revenue from the postal rates on coast mail was paid to the BEA Government
for runners on the disputed stage between Ravine and Kikuyu, and an attempt may
therefore have been made to account for local mails separately. Numbers of the small '0'
variety overprinted 'L' can barely have reached double figures, and on scarcity they are
vastly under-catalogued. There may never have been a whole sheet of the R5: the Seys
copy (ex-Stonehill) was 'believed to be the only known used example'.


The typeset issues are very rare on covers (especially the 'L' type with only ten covers known.

"L" overprint (SG71) which has been neatly cut square and has been cancelled 
by a blue crayon "X". (It is possible that a stamp for the second journey 
was originally placed on the reverse of the envelope, or it may have 
been sent by other means.) Only around 10 "L" overprint covers/fronts 
are known, making them even rarer than the Type-Written Missionary covers!

\section{Combination Covers}

The most sought-after postal history items of this issue are the combination covers resulting
from the dual postal system and rates, though in fact covers bearing only the typesets used
internally are much rarer, as are combination covers (still necessary between November
1898 and April 1899) bearing the two different Queen's Head issues.
The combination rates are confusing until it is realised that the Uganda rate is per oz
?.nd the BEA rate per \ oz. Thus the steps of combination go:

Letter weight Uganda BEA
under \ oz 4 as 2\ as
\ oz-1 oz 4 as 5 as
1 oz-1^ oz 8 as 1\ as
H oz-2 oz 8 as 10 as

In behind-the-scenes accounting (as hinted above) the story is not quite as simple as this, but as far as understanding any combination cover is concerned, it is enough. The additional complications will be dealt with in articles elsewhere.

For some time the modus operand! was for the Uganda stamp to be affixed to the envelope,
usually on the left side or well to the left of the top right-hand corner (occasionally on the
back) and the envelope initialled in the left-hand bottom corner (occasionally elsewhere).
The Mombasa postmaster affixed BEA stamps and charged to account. The Uganda stamp
was occasionally tied by a Mombasa postmark, but more often this seems to have been
deliberately avoided, and many perfectly genuine covers have unmarked, untied Uganda
stamps. The BEA stamps are (invariably?) placed on the front of the cover. The CMS
missionaries did not immediately give up their private service and where their mail came
down by their own runners it may have been accounted for and the stamps affixed by their
agents in Mombasa. But their mail does not thereby differ in appearance from that of
(eg) the Mill Hill Fathers. The senders of combination covers can nearly always be identified and from this the place of origin of the cover itself.

Towards the end of the period of use BEA stamps were held in Uganda either by individuals,
agents, or (latterly, probably) district collectors, and put on together at source of
posting. This saved a cumbersome method of accounting. The practice can only certainlybe detected where the sender has placed the Uganda stamp slightly overlapping the BEA
stamp, or after the introduction of cancellers when both stamps are clearly cancelled at
source.

\section{Cancellation}

For two years of the life of this issue the method of obliteration was the same as for the
typewritten issues: nothing; crosses in pencil, black, blue, or red; or in ink; or endorse-ments of various kinds from a simple place-name or date to the military flourishes of Col
Broome or Dr Carre.

According to Phillips (op cit) 'In 1897 cancelling dies were ordered from Messrs Waterlow \& Sons, London, and some thirty were received about January 1898. These postmarks consisted of a circle 25mm in diameter, with the name of the town curved, and the date in two lines inside.' He recorded the earliest date seen as 10 AU 98.

These cancellers are mysterious. Listing the early offices of Uganda and their cancellations is a task for another time and place, but it is certain that nothing like thirty were
put into use at this time, and equally certain that none was used before August 1898.
Confirmation of August would be a surprise and a date in November would be easier to
accept for their distribution. The question of the use of Consular seals for franking must
also be considered elsewhere.

Three squared-circle marks are also occasionally seen cancelling typesets. MACHAKOS
is rare and may have happened only when loose letters were brought in by caravan.
KIKURGU should be the same, but a number seem to have been done 'to order' (during the
DC's absence); despite much nonsense dispensed over the years, Kikurgu (a misspelling of
Kikuyu) is proven to be genuine by the contemporary evidence of the district officer who
wielded it on its first day of use. Both places are in the BEA, but all Ugandan mail had to
pass through them. The third mark reads ROUBAGA and is undoubtedly bogus. Mail
from the White Fathers sometimes bears unofficial rubber stamps of Smith, Mackenzie
\& Co, their agents, who had an office in Kampala.

In theory the typesets were superseded by the Queen's Head issue in November 1898.
In practice they were plentiful and had the appeal of the unusual to the soldiers, railway
surveyors, and adventurers who were opening up the country. Also distribution of the new
issue was delayed by the Sudanese mutiny. In many places the typesets survived through
1899 and are known used from outlandish places such as Wadelai as late as 1903, by which
time much of the romance had disappeared from the Uganda post.
