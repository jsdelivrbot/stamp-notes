###The Typeset Issues

The typeset issues are very rare on covers (especially the 'L' type with only ten covers known. 

\ph[70%]{uganda/0360.jpg}{


RARE "L" OVERPRINT TYPESET 2as ON TWICE-POSTED COVER FRONT 
TO MENGO & KOKI; Late 1897/early 1898 front (minor edge-faults)
originally sent to Rev. Pike at "Mengo" (in the hand of Rev. Martin Hall)
and re-used (a not infrequent occurrence in Uganda at this date when all 
paper was often in very short supply) to send a letter (presumably from Mengo) 
to "R.H. Leakey Esq., C.M.S., Koki" (in the hand of Rev. G.K. Baskerville); 
one of these journeys required the use of a Typeset 2a black with 
"L" overprint (SG71) which has been neatly cut square and has been cancelled 
by a blue crayon "X". (It is possible that a stamp for the second journey 
was originally placed on the reverse of the envelope, or it may have 
been sent by other means.) Only around 10 "L" overprint covers/fronts 
are known, making them even rarer than the Type-Written Missionary covers! 
This redirected example is particularly interesting. [Ex Dunstan.] Photo

RARE FIRST DAY COVER OF THE "MASINDI" DATESTAMP WITH "SET" OF "L"-OVERPRINT TYPESET ISSUES; 
Remarkable 1 Dec. 1898 small env. endorsed "Local" addressed to 
"Geo. Wilson Esqr., Asst. Commissioner, Kampalla, Uganda", initialled by "C.H.U.P." 
(Major Charles Price, Commander of the Unyoro District); franked by fine "L" overprint 1a, 3as, 4as, 8as & 1r (SG70, 72, 73, 74 & 75; latter rare and with 4 good margins - wide wing-margin at right), all tied by superb "MASINDI" c.d.s.'s, and all also cancelled with Price's manuscript "C.H.U.P.". This appears to be a unique souvenir of the introduction of the new postmark, sent between two senior officials both very much involved in the running of the postal service in Uganda. This usage of the "L" higher values is almost unique on cover. Photo

MATCHING FIRST DAY COVER OF THE "MASINDI" DATESTAMP WITH TYPESET "SET" TO 5 RUPEES; 1 Dec. 1898 long env. (slight bends) from Price addressed to "Captain M.J. Tighe Esq., 27th Battalion, Kampalla, Uganda" and franked with plain Typeset 1a, 2as, 3as, 4as, 8as, 1r & 5r, all tied by superb "MASINDI" datestamps (First Day of Use) and all also cancelled with Price's manuscript initials. [Tighe was in Uganda at this date clearing Sudanese mutineers in southern Unyoro. He later commanded the abortive Tanga landing in Nov. 1914.] Very rare usage of the entire set of the Typeset Issue. Huge SG catalogue on-cover value; the 5r not being priced. Photo

Similar "Price" 1 Dec. 1898 long env. (addressed to his brother Cyril, "C.U. Price", in Kampalla) with Tyepset set from 1a to 5r, all tied by v. fine First Day "MASINDI" datestamps. The env. (some gum-stains at each end) are all initialled "C.H.U.P.", and the cover is accompanied by a 16 May 1927 letter (no env.) written and signed by Price himself, giving the cover to his brother Cyril as a Birthday present! The letter explains a good deal of the background to the cover, and the fact that Price destroyed unused stocks of the stamps at Masindi at the time. Unique! (2 items). Photo
