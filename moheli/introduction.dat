\chapter{Moheli}

Moh\'eli, also known as Mwali, is one of the three islands which make up the 
nation of Comoros. Moh\'eli is located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa. 
It is by far the smallest of the Comoros islands. Its population, as of 2006, 
is about 38,000. Its capital city is {{wi:Fomboni}}. Its main ethnic group, as on the 
other Comoros islands Grande Comore and [Anjouan](../anjouan/introduction) 
as well as the French territory [Mayotte](../mayotte/introduction), is the 
Comorian ethnic group, a synthesis of Bantu, Arab, Malay and Malagasy culture, 
and the main religion is Sunni Islam.

Moh\'eli was administered by Mayotte 
and did not receive Group Type stamps until 1906, even though a Post Office was 
open much earlier. Until then stamps of the other Comoro Islands were used.
