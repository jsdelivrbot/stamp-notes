\chapter{Welcome}

Some time back, I tried to buy Robson Lowe's Encyclopaedias. It took a good two years to manage to source them from auctions.

Sometimes postal history research leads a collector down interesting paths that have nothing to do with the stamps, cancels, or other postal markings. The challenges become
even more interesting, and sometimes even more difficult to solve.

As one graduates from being a collector to a philatelist and postal historian teh need for information becomes more important. One has to acknowledge the numerous societies with an endless stream of publications. With the exception of a few most Journals fill the pages with events. Others are more scholarly and have been producing outstanding works for years.


For most of the images, sourced from Auctions you will notice we have included the estimates and the realizations, when information was available. This is by no means accurate.

\section{Stamp Circles}

Stamp Circles is primarily a Philatelic Study website, accessible from the web and mostly for free. It is a place to organize our studies and to interact with philatelists from all over the world. 


\section{Catalogues and serious philately}

Catalogues are an indispensable tool for the philatelist. They list the stamps of a country their varieties and their catalogue prices. But there are many limitations that modern web tools can help to overcome. Catalogues have their roots as catalogues listing prices of stamps for sale. For example Stanley Gibbons will sell you the stamps in their catalogue at the prices indicated. I am not too sure if they have the stock for everything, but for the ones they have they will sell you. 

The second limitation of catalogues is that they are only issued periodically and although important regions or countries are sold yearly, for the most difficult areas they are only issued at longer periods.

Catalogues are also poor references when it comes to postal history. They might give you an indicative price that a cover is worth 10 times the catalogue value of the stamps, but is mostly inaccurate, except as a relative rarity indicator. 

The third and more important limitation is that different catalogues list either more or less stamps than their counterparts (they are more specialized). You can find more information in a French Catalogue for French stamps than in a British catalogue. As all catalogue publishers vehemently defend their numbering system, the philatelist has a problem. 

At StampCircles we are developing our own stamp catalogues with the aim to overcome the above limitations. Firstly our aim is to detail the stamp issues for a stamp issuing authority, with the aim to not leave anything out. We know that this will take time and will evolve, but in the long run we can produce a more detailed description for a country.

Prices are curated as well as automated. So at any time we keep information on sales from various auctions, dealers and web auctions such as ebay to keep track of current trends. In the end this is our own opinion of a market related price. Register users will be able to input details and comments on all the pages to help fellow philatelists with their purchases. So in reality the price of a stamp or set is normally a range. What you buy it for or what you sell it for in the end it depends on you and the market and of course the condition of the stamp.
