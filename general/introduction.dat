\chapter{Welcome}

Some time back, I tried to buy Robson Lowe's Encyclopaedias. It took a good two years to manage to source them from auctions.

Sometimes postal history research leads a collector down interesting paths that have nothing to do with the stamps, cancels, or other postal markings. The challenges become
even more interesting, and sometimes even more difficult to solve.

As one graduates from being a collector to a philatelist and postal historian teh need for information becomes more important. One has to acknowledge the numerous societies with an endless stream of publications. With the exception of a few most Journals fill the pages with events. Others are more scholarly and have been producing outstanding works for years.


For most of the images, sourced from Auctions you will notice we have included the estimates and the realizations, when information was available. This is by no means accurate.

\section{Stamp Circles}

Stamp Circles is primarily a Philatelic Study website, accessible from the web and mostly for free. It is a place to organize our studies and to interact with philatelists from all over the world.
