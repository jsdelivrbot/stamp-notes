# 1881 Qutzesal Issue


The stamps were issued by the Guatemala Postal Department to commemorate the legendary Trogon of Guatemala called the “Quetzal”. The commemoration of this Trogon spans the years from 1879 through 1987. It is expected that the Quetzal will have further commemorations in the future. Other commemorations of the Quetzal include adding the Quetzal on the Guatemala flag, making the Quetzal the national bird of Guatemala, and changing the Guatemala currency to Quetzals in 1925, as the national currency, replacing the Peso. (See footnote 1.)
