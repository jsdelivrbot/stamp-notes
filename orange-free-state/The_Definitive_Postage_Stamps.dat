\chapter{The Definitive Postage Stamps}

Postage stamps were first issued in the Orange Free State on January 1st 1868. All the values were of a uniform design depicting the "tree of liberty" in the centre surmounting three posthorns on a horizontally shaded background, surrounded by a border lettered "Orange Vrij Staat" at the left, top and right, with the value in words at the foot in Cape Dutch.

The stamps were printed typographically by T. De La Rue and Co., in  London and the history of the prepararations for the isue is outlined in ref. 1b.

Over the period 1868-1900 stamps in the following duties appeared:

\begin{description}
\item[1868] Een Penny (1d) brown, Zes Pence (6d) carmine, een Shilling (1/-) orange.

\item[1878] Vier Pence (4d) blue, Vyf Shillings (5/-) green.

\item[1883-4] Half Penny chestnut, Twee Pence (2d) mauve, Drie Pence (3d) ultramarine.

\end{description}

In addition four colour changes were made one in 1894 and another in 1897.

\begin{description}

\item[1894] Een Penny purple.

\item [1897] Half Penny yellow/orange, Zes Pence blue, Een Shilling brown.
\end{description}


It will be noticed that in the case of the \half d value the English spelling "Half" was used, instead of "Halve", and this was evidently accepted by the Orange Free State authorities without comment.


\section{The Issued Stamps}

The first stamps to be issued, comprising the One Penny brown, Six Pence rose, and One Shilling orange, were placed on sale to teh public on January 1, 1868, and these three values sufficed to meet all postal needs for the next ten years.

The second guide in distinguishing the printings is teh perforation. All the stamps of the Orange Free state were printed on medium wove, white, unwatermarked paper and perforated 14 comb, but two different machines of totally different characteristics were used at different periods. Prior to 1978 De La Rue did not have their own perforating machines and their entire stamp production was sent to Somerset House to be perforated there. The machine for perforating the standard size of postage stamp sheet had the pins arranged so that it perforated a single row of holes down the centre of the vertical gutter, i.e., it produced wing margins on the sixth and seventh vertical rows. Furthermore, the rows of pins were arther irregular and control of the register was not very good, resulting in the perforation gutters junctions often being imperfect. This machine must have been used to perforate all the Free State postage stamps up to and including the first printings of the 4d and 5/- in October 1877.

\end{figure*}

In 1878 De La Rue installed their own perforation machine. The new machine perforated the vertical gutter on both sides and hence the wing margins ceased to appear. The lines of perforation were also very much straighter and teh control was so good that the holes were always perfectly aligned at the perforation junctions. This machine was used to perforate all teh Free State postage stamp printings from all and including the second printing in 1881.

By using these observations we can divide the printings into three broad groups as shown in Table.  In addition to this detective work many printings were surcharged for use as postage provisionals or overprinted for telegraph or revenue stamps. The dates of these surcharges or overprints are known with a fair degree of certainty and can be matched from Table 1 which printing was in stock at the time.
