\chapter{The Post Cart Routes of the Orange Free State}

The Orange Free State and it successors, remains until this day without major routes. During the period in discussion, the railways covered the area only partially and hence the coaching lines was the major means of conveying the posts. L H Lomax wrote an article back in the June 1961 Orange Free Study Circle No. 30 pg 359, describing these routes based mostly on his own reasearch.

\section{Passenger Coaches}

By 1893 the railways had replaced the coaching lines in Cape Colony and Natal. The cross-country traveller must either hire his own cart which will cost him about 40/- per day or trust the mail carts which charge about 6d per mile. In the latter case the journey is generally a rough one, as no special accommodation is provided for passengers who have to take their chance with the mail bags. If a party of two or three are travelling together, a private conveyance will not prove more expensive.
