\chapter{Five Shillings}

A high valuue 5/- stamp was ordered in 1877. This was required for heavy registered packets from the Gold Fields. The first printing of 1,000 sheets was invoiced on October 10, 1877 and was issued early in 1878. This printing was in green and was perforated on the Somerset House machine. The rate of consumption of this postage stamp was very low. A  part of the printing was used to provide the 1d provisional in 1881 and the \half d provisional in 1882, no further printing was called for until 1894.

The second printing of 1,025 sheets can be distinguished from the first only by the perforation which was carried out on the De La Rue machine. Very little of it was issued before the end of the Republic in March 1900 as 970 sheets were found in stock by the British and subsequently issued with the "V.R.I." overprint ref9.
