# Postage Stamps and Postal History of the Orange Free State


The first Orange Free State stamps were issued in 1868.
The O.F.S. was formally annexed to the British Crown and renamed the Orange River Colony on the 28th of May 1900.
In 1910 this colony along with Cape of Good Hope, Natal and Transvaal formed the 
Union of South Africa.

The sole design used was an orange tree, with the inscription "Oranje Vrij Staat" in the margin. The stamps were typographed by De La Rue and Company, and came in denominations from one penny to five shillings, in various colours. Periodic shortages forced the use of overprints, in 1877, 1881, 1882, 1888, 1890, 1892, 1896, and 1897. The stamps of the republic are generally common today, but some of the overprints are scarce. Many kinds of overprint errors are known (inverted, double, etc.), and some of them command high prices.

In 1900, the Republic fell into British occupation and the previous stamps were 
overprinted "V.R.I." and the same value of the original stamps. The colony was 
renamed in August 1900 and used Cape of Good Hope stamps overprinted with the new name 
<span class="initialism red">ORANGE/RIVER/COLONY.</span>. In 1902 a single 6d stamp was overprinted as the 
original occupation issues but with "E.R.I." instead of "V.R.I.". In 1903 a set 
was issued portraying King Edward VII, a springbok and a gnu. This set was 
printed again in 1905-09, and is the last set of the colony.

\section{Revenue stamps}

A variety of revenue stamps were issued both as the Orange Free State and the Orange River Colony. The Orange Free State revenues were also postally used.
