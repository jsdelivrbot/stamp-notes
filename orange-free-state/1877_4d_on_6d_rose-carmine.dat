\chapter{1877 4d on 6d rose-carmine}

Under aricle 41 (Tarriff of Postages) of the Postal Rules of 1868, the rate for inland letters not exceeding \half oz. in weight was fixed at 6d. In August 1877 the Volksraad altered the regulations of the postal services and article 41 was amended, and a reduction of 2d on the internal postage was accepted.

The Postmaster General at this time who according to Marriott and Laurence was Mr W H Canisius, ordered in London stamps of the 4d value to be printed in blue, but pending their arrival the rate change was met by surcharging the 6d rose-carmine with a figure "4" in black. 

There are four types generally listed in the catalogues and these are shown below.

The nineteenth century catalogues listed a fifth type. Leon de Raay carried out an extensive investigation which led him to believe that no genuine fifth type existed and it was subsequently dropped from the catalogues. There are several alleged examples of this fifth type but as they differ from each other one can concur with the Handbook that no genuine fifth type existed.

These were initially recorded by De Raay. He had a copy of a type d and the two surcharges were one above the other. 

The arrangement of the four types was never established. Philatelists at the time did not appear to have kept any copies. As mint copies in blocks are rare, it is inevitable that the setting will never be satisfactorily reconstructed.

Marriot and Laurence by using the known blocks, have partially offered a reconstruction.
This is based on two blocks of six, two blocks of four and a number of pairs and two strips of three. They convincingly argue that .
