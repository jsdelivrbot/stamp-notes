##Seychelles: Postal history and Stamps

###Early mail

Early communications with the island were not regular and inevitably had to be carried out by passing ship. Such early mail is hard to find and inevitably changes hands every few years. Most of the items shown below were dispersed in the Weiss Harmer's sale in 2004 and re-appeared in the market in 2012.

Among other distinguished provenance: Dale-Lichtenstein, Farmer, G. South, K. Holt, Cdr. Burnett and others. 

We present the early mail in a chronological order to make it easy to add materials at a later stage.
