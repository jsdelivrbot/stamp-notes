##Seychelles: Postal history and Stamps
### Mauritius used in Seychelles - covers
The earliest known cover with stamps of Mauritius used in Seychelles is dated 1863 and it last changed hands in 2012. With such small availability of covers, inevitably prices are very high. Should they have been chinese they would have fetched at prices with at least two orders of magnitude higher.
