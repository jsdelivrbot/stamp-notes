##Seychelles: Postal history and Stamps
### Mauritius used in Seychelles - Stationery

Postal stationary from Mauritius can also be found used in seychelles. An interesting card was sold at the 2012 Feldman's Geneva auction addressed to Seychelles. Sadly I don't have the details on the writing side to see why someone would be corresponding from Seychelles to Romania in 1886 or how long it took to reach its destination.
