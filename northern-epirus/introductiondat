##Northern Epirus
From 1912 to 1916, {{wi:Northern_Epirus}} (also known as southern Albania) was run by a provisional Greek government, opposing its cession to newly-founded Albania, and operated its own postal service and issued postage stamps for a period during 1914.



###Chimarra and Skull Issue

In 1914 the Greek revolutionary authority of Chimarra issued a set of 4 values in a very small quantity. At that time postal service of that area was limited and only few copies are saved to nowadays.

This first issue of Northern Epirus is known to collectors as the _Skulls_ or the _Chimarra Issue._ It was issued in February, 1914. Although this was a local issue the stamps can be found with genuine cancellatons of 'Delvinon' and 'Agioi Saranta'. They were printed on rice paper by the use of rubber handstamps. The rubber handstamps were used in three distinct operations:

- image of the stamp
- impression of the value
- impression of the monogram of Spyromilios.

One can distinguish four kinds of printings:

- Genuine stamps.
- Printings by means of genuine handstamps on similar paper to above, known as the 'first Spetsiotis reprints'.
- Printings b means of genuine handstamps on different thicker paper.
- Total forgeries. 


<div style="clear:both"></div>
{{warning:  Forgeries are also known on thicker yellowish paper; indeed, the SG catalogue 
cautions that ‘the majority of stamps on the market are forgeries’.}}
 Mailed copies on covers are extremely rare. Thus catalogue value of this set is over $1500.
 Today ebay is full of auctions offering this rare set mint, used or on covers.  Unfortunately most of them are sold to victim-collectors that think that they bought a rare set for only $50 or $100. ALL are forgeries!!!. Known forgeries with a real value of less than $10.
 I saw at list 100 sets & covers bearing this set sold at prices more than $50. Poor collectors beware!!!

### Now some tips:
 The genuine copies are easily distinguished by the paper used. You have never seen this kind of paper at another stamp.
 The printing is poor & oily. You may see from the back the front icon.
 All forged covers are address to Mr. Gonkakis ( in Greek or English) either in Corfu or Athens. ( Backstamped forged properly).
 Most used sets on pieces are cut offs  from these covers. There are hundreds of them.
 My advise is when you buy forgery pay for a forgery.
 For the history matters, unfortunately the revolution of the Greeks in Epirus failed twice, due to fascist Italy that supported the creation of a new vassal state to its interest, Albania.

###First Stamps
The first stamps associated with Epirus were issued at Himarë in February 1914. The set of four (1, 5, 10, and 25 lepta) are large stamps prominently featuring a double-headed eagle along with a skull and crossbones, and inscribed "ΕΛΛ. ΑΥΤΟΝ. ΗΠΕΙΡΟΣ / ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΑ Η ΘΑΝΑΤΟΣ / ΑΜΥΝΕΣΘΑΙ ΠΕΡΙ ΠΑΤΡΗΣ" (Greek Autonomous Epirus - Freedom or Death - Defend our Country") . Produced manually with a handstamp, they also have a control mark on the back consisting of a blue oval with the letters "ΣΠ" inside, after Spyros Spyromilios, the commander at Chimarra. Some experts argue that these do not qualify as official stamp issues; even so, a set of four is worth about US$700.

The first undoubted issue of the provisional government came out in March. The set of eight, with values ranging from one lepton to 5 drachma, all depicted an infantryman aiming a rifle while others look on; the frames of the 10l and 25l values are inscribed only with "ΗΠΕΙΡΟΣ", while the others read "ΑΥΤΟΝΟΜΟΣ / ΗΠΕΙΡΟΣ". Instead of being perforated, they have a serrate roulette that superficially resembles perforation, but is distinguished by angled cuts 
rather than the round roles of perforation.

###August 1914
In August, the government issued a new set of eight, with the same range of values as previously, but now showing the flag of Epirus in 
a two-color design. The design was modified to include "ΚΟΡΥΤΣΑ" at Koritsa, for the 25l and 50l values.

<h4>Autonomous North Epirus, (1914) Chimarra local issue</h4>
Also in August, S. Spyromilios at Chimarra had stocks of the stamps of Greece overprinted with 
"ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ / 1914 / ΧΕΙΜΑΡΡΑ". These overprints are both uncommon, 
and have been extensively counterfeited.

__Greece issued special overprints for the parts of northern Epirus under occupation, 
starting in 1914. Initially the occupation stamps of 1913 were overprinted "B. EPEIROS" 
horizontally in black; red overprints were made, but not officially issued. 
(Some cancelled copies are known to exist.) 
In 1916, the same overprinted was applied vertically, reading either up or down, to regular Greek stamps.__

All of these have been counterfeited.

The lower values of the stamps of Epirus are common and readily available both used and unused, typically costing the collector only a few cents. The rarest stamp is the occupation overprint on the 5-drachma value, which is valued at around US$350.
