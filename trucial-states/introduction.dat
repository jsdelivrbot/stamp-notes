\chapter{Trucial States}  

Between 1961 and 1963 the sheikdoms created a short-lived postal union experiment. 
Under the name ``Trucial states'' they issued 11 definitive stamps for postal usage. 
Additionally, the stamps of British PA for Eastern Arabia were still in in use too.

The stamps are easier to find mint than used and are seldom seen on commercial covers. They can be found on FDCs which retail over $100.00.
