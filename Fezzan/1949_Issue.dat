### 1949, French occupation Issues 
In 1949, the French Government Printing Works at Paris (A.F.T.P) produced a second set of 11 values to prepay regular postal charges. This set of pictorials consists of eleven stamps with five different basic designs. They regarded as very well designed and executed.

The first two values were engraved by Cortot. They depict the ruined tower at {{wi:Djerma}}. The one franc value is printed in black and the two in rose pink.

The last two high value stamps feature General LeClerc, commander of the Free French Forces. The stamps were engraved by R. Serres.

The issue is well represented by regular artists proofs, die color proofs, and imperforate stamps. Die color proofs exist for the 1f., 4f., 10f., 15f. and 50fr values only.

Covers are scarce, used stamps are infrequently found and mint stamps of this Second Regular Postage Issue are certainly not plentiful.
