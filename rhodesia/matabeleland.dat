During the construction of the telegraph line from Tati to Bulawayo, captain L. Norris-Newman (reuter's Agent) established
a postal service of runners from Bulawayo who carried his 
messages for telegraphing to points reached by the construction party.

This service he extended to the local inhabitants, whiched helped materially to reduce expenses.

He had printed off by {{wi:cyclostyle}} 50 sheets of 18 labels (6x3) consisting of three values.
Bulawayo to {{wi:Ramanguabane_River}} (96 miles) 10/- top row, to Mangove (60 miles) 5/- middle and Fig Tree (29 miles) 2/6 (bottom row).

At the beginning the service was weekly to Tamaguabane River but when the distances reduced as the line advanced their frequency increased, until
by arrangement the post office took over three days a week and Newman the remainder.

When the line reached Fig tree, the post office charge was reduced to 1/-, and Newman abandoned his service, which had operated from
March 28 to June 1894.

__Captain Newman cancelled each label by blue pencil or pen with his initial and date, after it
had been affixed to the original message. Duplicate copies only were carried by the runners.__
