##King George V - 1913-14 Admiral Issues

Making sense of all the colour variations, is difficult and Robson Lowe recommended of using an mercury lamp and went as far as to list two columns of colours. We divided the shades according to Stanley Gibbons and made a best effort to split them into main groups. These colour variations were a consequence of ink ingredient shortages, which were previously imported from Germany, and the shortage of skilled craftsmen and printers.

The set of 18 stamps consisted of the following denominations was issued on 1st September\cite{smith:rhodesia}, 1913: 1/2d., 1d., 2d., 2 1/2d., 3d., 4d., 5d., 6d., 8d., 10d., 1s., 2s., 2 s 6d., 3s. 5d., 7s. 6d., 10s. and \pound1.

The stamps were engraved in \textit{taille douce} and recess printed by Waterlow and Sons of London. The duty plate was printed first and then the head plate. The design shows King George V in Admiral's undress uniform. The paper of the stamps is toned wove with yellowish gum.

For the production of these stamps three dies were engraved which resulted in distinctive stamps being printed from the various plates produced by different dies. Some suggested that the three dies were taken from a master die, and teh variations represent retouches by the engraver, but no confirmation of this view can be found.

The low value stamps for reason of economy were printed in sheets of 240 stamps consisting of four panes of 60; arranged in six rows of ten and separated by plain margins or gutters. In the remaining values the sheets consisted of 60 stamps arranged in ten rows of six.

The stamps were perforated by a single line machine. The spacing between the lines of perforation vary considerably, both vertically and horizontally. 

As previously described the low values were printed from a single plate in sheets of 240 stamps and in \textit{single colour}  so they are the easiet apart of the shade to distinguish.

Those printed from double plates utilized three portrait dies and they were printed in sheets of 60 6 x 10. In addition the stamps can also be found with different perforations.


\section{The Three Dies}

The three dies are shown in \ref{threedies}, which is from Robson Lowe's publication. The major distinguishing characteristics is the absence or not of an outline to the cap and shadings to the left ear. 

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../rhodesia/admiral-dies.jpg}
\caption{Die I (\textit{left}) No outline to cap. Left ear unshaded and without outline.
Die II (\textit{middle}) Faint broken outline to the cap. Left ear shaded but without outline. Die III (\textit{right})}
\label{threedies}
\end{figure*}

With a bit of practice, the dies are easy to discern with the naked eye for most of the stamps.

The unsold stocks of this issue returned from Post Offices in  SOuthern Rhodesia were destroyed on 31st March, 1925.
