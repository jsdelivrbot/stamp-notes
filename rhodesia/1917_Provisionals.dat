\chapter{1917 Provisionals}

The Territories of both Southern and Northern Rhodesia were administered by the British South Africa Comapny, and used the same postage stamps, which were designated merely `RHODESIA`. During the Great War, both Territories, in common with many other British Colonies, decided in 1917 to raise the postal rates with a view to increasing revenue and to make up the loss caused by the reduced use of postal facilities. The increased demand for the higher denominations resulted in the depletion of stocks of 1/2d. stamps in Northern Rhodesia.\cite{smith:rhodesia}

The Northern Rhodesia Administration tried to obtain a supply from Southern Rhodesia, but as they could not guarantee to replace them by a fixed date, tehy decided to surcharge teh 1d. stamp with a value of 1/2d. The surcharge was printed by the Administration's Printing Works at Livingstone and the issue was placed on sale on 1st August, 1917.

The stamps were overprinted in blue-black and also in purple aniline ink with the words `Half Penny` in two lines and teh original denomination was obliterated by two short bars on either side. The printer set up two horizontal rows of type and after having removed all the margins from the original sheets, printed the surcharge in three operations on panes of 60 stamps.

As there was some doubt as to whether the stamps were valid in Southern Rhodesia and in an answer to a query from the Postmaster in Bulawayo, the Postmaster Livingstone replied as:\cite{smith:rhodesia}

\begin{blockquote}
I beg to inform you that the 1d. stamp overprinted 1/2d. is merely a provisional issue to meet a temporary shortage of half-penny stamps and is only available for postage purposes in Northern Rhodesia.
\end{blockquote}

Of this issue one printing was made of 60,000 stamps after which the type was broken up and an order was sent to London for a supply of 1/2d. green stamps.

Demand from Collectors and the Philatelic Trade resulted in the stocks being depleted and the Administration arranged for a further supply of stamps to be surcharged. As the type was already broken up a new setting was prepared. The same printer proceeded as before in the production of the second printing, but in this case the word `half penny` was hyphenated. In addition the word `Penny` was shorter than the first printing by 2mm and also terminated by a full-stop.

A quantity of 60,000 was again printed and they were placed on sale on  2nd September, 1917.

In the second printing the aniline ink used penetrated the paper strongly. Vertical pairs exist where one overprint is in ordinary ink and the other in aniline.

The stock of the provisional issue became exhausted on 22nd April, 1918, and no further issues were made.

\subsection{The Inverted Surcharge}

Smith narrated the story of the inverted surcharge, when a stamp collector residing in Livingstone purchased a supply of the first surcharge and found two sheets with the inverted surcharge. The Post Office instituted an enquiry immediately but no more sheets could be found.\footnote{See Smith page 372.} 

It would appear that the two sheets of inverted overprints were purposely printed that way, and consequently there was an outcry in the philatelic press. A number of them exist with genuine postmarks, which the critics claim were obtained to give the stamps an air of respectability.
