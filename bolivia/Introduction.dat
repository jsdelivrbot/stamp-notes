\section{Bolivia, Stamps and Postal History}

Bolivia was formerly known as Upper Peru and became an independent 
republic on 6 August 1825. It has produced its own stamps since 1867.[1] 
Stamps from Bolivia are marked as Correos de Bolivia. Tensions between 
Chile and Bolivia have influenced both country's stamps and postal history.

Up to 1895 postal routes were composed mainly of the Oruro-Antofagasta 
railway, riders on horseback and river boats. Internal postal routes 
remained poor until the introduction of airmail in the 1920s.

British stamps were used between 1865 and 1878 at the port of Cobija, 
which no longer exists, and they may be identified by the cancellation C39.

Chilean stamps were used in occupied areas of Bolivia between 1 December 
1881 and 11 October 1883.
