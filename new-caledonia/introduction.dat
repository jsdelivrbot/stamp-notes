\chapter{New Caledonia}  


THE island of New Caledonia was discovered by Captain James Cook in 1774.
It lies in the Pacific Ocean about 1,200 miles North east of Sydney in Australia and about
700 miles east of the Queensland coast.

Its length is about 250 miles and it is thirty to forty miles wide.
Of its 72,000 inhabitants, some 37,000 are Melanesians, 25,000 Europeans (mainly
French), 4,000 Vietnamese, 3,000 Indonesians and 3,000 Polynesians.
New Caledonia has several dependencies, including the He des Pins and the Loyalty
Islands (Mare, Lifou and Uvea).\cite{options}

English and French missionaries arrived in New Caledonia during the 1840's and their
letters, which went via Sydney, were probably carried on vessels belonging to Captain
James Paddon, an English trader in sandalwood, who set up his New Caledonia headquarters
on the nearby He des Pins and later on He Nou.

It had been my intention to do research on that early postal history for inclusion in this
paper, but having been informed by Monsieur Georges Kling, the former Postmaster-
General of New Caledonia, that he will be publishing a history of its postal services shortly,
my remarks this evening start in the 1850's.

At one time it was believed that covers bearing N.S.W. stamps, cancelled with a rhombus
of 9 x 10 or 10 x 10 closely set dots, emanated from New Caledonia around 1850, but G. J.
Hutson states that there are powerful arguments against this being the case. It is possible
that this cancellation was applied on ship letters entering Sydney and which had missed the
normal cancellation.1

In 1853, New Caledonia was declared a colony of France, with its capital at Port de
France, later re-named Noumea. Announcing the inauguration on 4th August, 1859 of the
island's first internal postal service between Port de France and Kanala (Napoleonville),
the Director of the Interior said: 'The letters shall be franked by means of a stamp of 10
centimes, made specially for this purpose in the colony itself. . .', adding that the Director
of the printing works had been ordered to have the stamps lithographed with as little delay
as possible.2

In October 1859, a new publication, the Moniteur Imperial de la Nouvelle-Caledonie et
Dependences said that a regular external mail service had been arranged between New
Caledonia and Sydney: dates and times of posting were given. Single letters needed one
'Sydney postage stamp'; double letters required two 'Sydney postage stamps'.3 Shortly
afterwards it was stated officially that as from 1st January, 1860, on all letters passing
through the post at Port de France or put on board the packet steamer, a tax of 1 decime
(10 cents) was obligatory, failing payment of which letters would not be forwarded to their destination.4 Letters sent to Europe (or other countries via Australia) thus needed both a
local (10 cents) stamp and a 6d. N.S.W. stamp.

(If the letter weighed more than half an ounce, an additional 6d. N.S.W. stamp was
required for each half ounce thereafter).

Meanwhile in France prepayment of letters by means of adhesive postage stamps had
been in vogue for some years.

As early as 1853 a French law had forecast the issue of special stamps for all French
Colonies but five years elapsed before Albert Barre of the Paris mint was invited to submit
a design. 5

It took the form of a crowned eagle, enclosed in a circular inscription, set inside a square,
imperforate, stamp. Die proofs were approved in November, 1858, and the first two values
of what became known as the 'Colonies Francaises Emissions Generales' came out in
June, 1859. None, however, appear to have been requisitioned by New Caledonia at that
date. (Prior to 1859, the 10 cent, 25 cent and 1 franc carmine from the 1849 emission of
France were used in certain French Colonies but not in New Caledonia).

\subsection{The Triquera Stamp}
Whether in disregard of the impending issue of Eagles for all French Colonies or in ignorance of those plans, the New Caledonian authorities commissioned Louis Triquera, a
sergeant of of the New 
Caledonian garrison quartered there, to design a special 10 centimes stamp for the island.6  Serjeant Triquera, 
etched the stamps apparently with a point of a pin. 
The sheet consisted of fifty stamps, each 
one separately drawn, and consequently 
differing from all the rest. Their employ- 
ment was stopped by the Parisian post- 
office as soon as it heard of their being in 
use ; and, curiously enough, the information 
was incidentally conveyed by a well-known 
stamp collector, M. Berger Levrault, in 
the course of a conversation he had with 
the head of the postage-stamp department 
at Paris, in 1861. Original copies are very 
scarce, but the stones from which they were 
printed having been preserved by the 
military engraver's relatives (he himself 
being dead), reprints of the entire sheet 
have been obtained, and are comparatively 
inexpensive. â€” Dr. Grays Illustrated Cata- 
logue. quoted in The Philatelist 1876.


\begin{marginfigure}

His talents as an artist can be seen from the photo of one of his local landscapes that is in the frames and which appeared in the Moniteur Imperial on Christmas Day, 1859.
Setting about his task with alacrity, Triquera engraved upon a piece of limestone, in five
rows of ten, a non-laureated profile portrait of Napoleon III, set in a pearl-edged octagon and enclosed in a double-lined outer frame.

There was a rumour that some disgruntled convict on the island had surreptitiously
introduced into the paper, on which the Triquera stamps were printed, a watermark
injurious to the Emperor but the Musee Postal in Paris say that such was not so.

In fact, the absence of a watermark in all stamps of New Caledonia has not only encouraged
forgeries, but has deprived the specialist of one fascinating phase of philately.

I show an unused sheet (50) of the Triquera issue. No two stamps are alike and the
plating characteristics of each were described by the author in Philately from Australia a
few years ago.7

\end{figure*}

Official recognition of the issue appeared in the Moniteur Imperial of 1st January, 1860
as follows: 'Postage stamps of the colony may be obtained at the Director's office at the
price of 5 francs the 50 stamps. Not less than 10 will be delivered at a tune.'8

E. D. Bacon says that the Triquera stamp was not reprinted but that reprints were made
from a photographic transfer. They are in black instead of greyish black and the impression is thicker and less distinct than the original.9

For some reason the existence of the Triquera issue did not become known in Paris until
a year or so later. The reaction of the Ministry of Colonies in Paris was immediate. The whole issue was suppressed.

Exceedingly few Triquera stamps that have passed through the post have survived.
I desire, however, to thank the Expert Committee and Mr Hamilton Croaker of N.S.W.
for permission to show a photograph of one in his collection with the 'PF' cancellation.

The literature shows too that a Triquera stamp was found obliterated with three concentric
ovals enclosing the letters 'EF' denoting 'Empire Francaise'.10

I show a cover from the Burrus Collection and a facsimile of it had previously been
published by Monsieur Maury in his Collection de Timbres. It left Port de France on 25th
May, 1860, bearing an unobliterated Triquera stamp and alongside is a 6d. N.S.W. stamp
cancelled with N.S.W. three concentric ovals in Sydney (25th July, 1860). In red, there is
(twice) on the front 'Col Fra V Suez Amb 11 Sept, I860'. On the back is 'Ship Letter Sydney
C Ju 25 I860'. Also on the back: 'Bureau Maritime, Le Havre 13 Sept. I860' (in red) and,
finally, at its destination: 'Saint-Pierre-Martinique 5 Nov. I860.'11

Oscar Berger Levrault reported another cover which had a I/- N.S.W. stamp alongside an
unobliterated Triquera one.12

The speculative nature of the Triquera issue was quickly realised and within three years
a French newspaper, Le Voleur (August 27th, 1863, No. 356), from which a photographic
extract is shown, recorded that a sheet of fifty unused Triquera stamps had been sold for
1,000 francs, i.e. each stamp had fetched 200 times its face value.

No Eagle stamps seem to have been dispatched from Paris to New Caledonia until
the spring of 1862, when four values (lc., 5c., lOc. and 40c.) were sent out there, but, the
parcel of lOc. having become lost in transit, only three values were available for issue, when
a decree authorising their sale in the island was passed in September of that year.13
Subsequently all denominations of Eagles were in circulation in New Caledonia but
specimens of lc., 5c. and 80c. are extremely rare.

The distinctive obliterator or 'killer' for New Caledonia was a mute, or blind, lozenge
consisting of 8 x 8 dots, 14 mm. wide. The date and place postmark had to be struck elsewhere on the face or back of the cover.14

I show a Port de France postmark on piece dated 7th November, 1863, two 1869 covers
from Noumea (the later name for Port de France) having lOc., 20c., and 40c. Eagles with
lozenge obliterations, and several singles, likewise obliterated.
Printing of Eagles ceased in December, 1869.

After the Eagles, supplies of Napoleon III stamps were made available for the French
Colonies including New Caledonia, though the issue was much delayed by the war of 1870
and various political problems.* Two of the designs were laureated. A third design, the
'Empire', is non-laureated. All denominations of the colonial Napoleon stamps, which were
imperforate, were issued in New Caledonia but they are very rare.

A 1c. laureated Napoleon stamp, with large figures, is being circulated.

The Ceres (or Liberty) issue for the French Colonies was printed partly from the original
1849-50 plates of France and later from new plates made in 1872.

There were three designs: all imperforate. The first is without border and has large figures:
the second has a border with small figures within it: the third is similar to the second but the
figures are more prominent.

The 2c., 4c. and 20c. Ceres were never used in New Caledonia. Of the remaining values
which were in circulation there, the 15c. is rare and the 1c. very rare. Specimens are here of the 10c., 25c. and 40c. Ceres, as well as the 40c. Ceres with the wide figure '4', all being obliterated with the 8 x 8 dots, 14 mm. wide lozenge. There is also a cover franked with lOc. and 30c. Ceres stamps and obliterated in Noumea with the circular date stamp which, in 1876, replaced the lozenge as obliterator.



Monsieur Leon Dubus of Paris has most kindly lent from his collection this unusual cover.
It has two lOc. Ceres, one 30c. Ceres and two Id. N.S.W. Stamps, all of which were bought
and affixed in the New Hebrides, though not obliterated there. However, on reaching
Noumea, all five stamps were cancelled (15th December, 1876) on the way to Sydney.
Supplies of Ceres stamps in New Caledonia evidently became exhausted in 1876 for here
are used and unused specimens of a triangular handstamp, in two different colours of ink,
indicating that, due to no stamps being available in the island at the time, payment was due at destination. (S.G.la).

The Ceres series was followed in 1876 by the imperforate 'Peace and Commerce' type,
design by J. A. Sage, and in France called after his name.

All denominations of the Sage issue were used in New Caledonia, it being one of only
three French Colonies in which the 25c. black was made available. Quite a few of the Sage
denominations cancelled in New Caledonia are, however, rare. (Of the 1887 Sage reprints,
the 3c. ochre, 3c. grey, 25c. black/rose and 5F. lilac were never made available for colonial
use.)

A range of Sage stamps, having various New Caledonia post offices cancellations,
together with a pair of the 25c. ochre/yellow on cover having a Noumea cancellation,
are here for your study.

Last of the general issues stamps for the French Colonies was the Alphee Dubois, or
'Commerce' design. They were perforate (P. 14 x 13Â£), thus fulfilling a wish on the part
of the colonies which had long been thwarted.

Except for the 1c., 2c., and 4c. values, all denominations of the Dubois series were in
circulation in New Caledonia. Only the 20c. there is rare.

Sundry Dubois stamps bearing the cancellations of various post offices throughout the
island, as well as a couple of the 25c. ochre/yellow on a cover from Noumea, are shown.
I would like to record my thanks to the Rev. A. W. Ronald Hughes for allowing me to
acquire from his collection of French Colonies General Issues some of these New Caledonian
cancellations and for his helpful advice But despite all these stamp issues having been in circulation in New Caledonia, evidence
will now be put before you that prepayment by means of adhesive stamps had by no means
become obligatory there.

(i) First, here is a stampless cover, having the Port de France circular date stamp of
1st September, 1860, and on which there has been handwritten, in ink, the charge
mark of '6' (cents) collectable at Rennes in France;

(ii) Secondly, this is a stampless letter from Yate in New Caledonia, having the Port de
France circular date stamp of 7th August, 1866 and which bears the handwritten
charge mark of '8' (cents) payable on arrival at the Loire; and

(iii) Thirdly, here is a stampless letter from a convict on the New Caledonia island of
He Nou. It is rubber-stamped inside : 'Vu: Le Commandt. du Penitencier', while,
on the outside, is the Noumea circular date stamp of 18th May, 1876 and the
handwritten charge mark of '10' (cents) due at destination in France.

Vessels visiting New Caledonia often carried on board a 'Boite Mobile' or mobile
posting box. For example, although this cover here has 'Noumea (Nouvelle Caledonie)'
printed on the front and has a wax seal marked 'Noumea' on the back, it carries no New
Caledonia stamps nor any Noumea circular date stamp, because evidently it was a lastminute
letter put into a 'Boite Mobile' on some vessel just leaving for Sydney.
On arrival in Sydney, however, en route for Bordeaux in France, three N.S.W. 8d.
stamps were affixed, cancelled with the N.S.W. four concentric ovals obliterator and the
Sydney date stamp (3rd October, 1878) struck alongside.

Again, through the courtesy of Monsieur Dubus of Paris, this 'Boite Mobile' cover from
his collection is here for your examination. It was sent from Sydney, bearing a 6d. N.S.W.
stamp, to Noumea where it was stamped with the date (12th August, 1882) and a special
'Boite Mobile' cachet:

\subsection{Initials Issue}
It was in 1881 that New Caledonia had the honour of being the first colony in France
to have identifying initials on its stamps prior to issue.

For in that year, Admiral Courbet, the Governor of New Caledonia, issued instructions
for certain of the imperforate Sage stamps to be surcharged for use as 5c. and 25c. The
surcharge included the letters 'N C E' (15 mm. across) in heavy black type with bars,
. above and below.

Later, the letters 'N C E' were set wider apart (17 1/2mm.) and examples of both sets,
including a specimen of S.G.2 on cover, are here for you to look at.
Other provisionals, shown on the walls, came out between 1886 and 1892.


The climate of New Caledonia caused these French Colonies General Issues stamps to
weather. Thus forgeries of the rare S.G.16, one sheet of which got in amongst the others by
mistake, can easily be detected because a spurious surcharge applied to a fresh unused copy
of the one franc stamp that had never left France would deceive no-one.
I display an unused sheet (fifty stamps) of the 1891 lOc. surcharged on 30c., one pane of
which has the 'N C E 10 centimes' surcharge inverted.

There is also an unusual pair with double surcharge, one being inverted.
Of the 1892 emissions, here are examples of double overprints, inverted overprints and
pairs having the overprint missing on one of the pair. Some are rare.

In the frames is a 25c. overprinted 1892 stamp without a New Caledonia obliteration,
but which is cancelled with a N.S.W. triple oval postmark, having presumably been put into
a 'Boite Mobile' on a boat that was just leaving for Sydney.

New Caledonia was the only French Colony to put into circulation overprints of every
denomination of the Dubois issue including the 25c. yellow, all of which can be seen in the frames.15).

In 1892, the postal authorities in Paris adopted a uniform design for all French Colonies,
on which the name of the colony concerned was inserted inside a cartouche or tablet,
by a second printing.

Thus, for the first time, New Caledonia had stamps in which its name formed part of the
design, being printed in red, rose, orange or blue. They were perforate (P. 14 x 13Â£).
Thanks are due to Monsieur Dubus for having loaned from his collection these two
New Caledonia cartouche-type stamps with N.S.W. cancellations:

(i) A 5c. N.C. cartouche stamp, on piece, obliterated with the N.S.W. three concentric
ovals and alongside the Sydney date stamp (29th October, 1895); and

(ii) A cover with two lOc. N.C. cartouche stamps, obliterated with the Sydney date stamp
(29th June, 1908) en route for Bordeaux.

\subsection{Military}

From 1885 onwards, French troops garrisoned on the island were allowed to send their
letters home for 15c. instead of the normal 25c. and a 1886 'CORR.D. ARM' cover from
Noumea is shown.

In 1893 the experiment was tried of issuing to all troops a supply of special lOc. military
stamps free of charge.

The first such stamp (17 x 22-5 mm.), which was imperforate, had '10 centimes' at the
foot, but, as this was alleged to encroach upon the postal monopoly, it was replaced by a
second issue (16-5 x 20-5 mm.) without any value appearing on the stamp.
There was a third issue (16x21 mm.) on which the individual number of each stamp no
longer formed part of the design.

The fourth issue (18-5 x 23-5 mm.) had crossed flags, with 'et Dependances' added after
'Nouvelle Caledonie' and with the number of each stamp printed inside a decapitated
triangle. Military stamps were discontinued after 1894.

Thereafter, however, letters sent home to France by soldiers still needed only a 15c.
stamp, provided that the envelope bore the 'CORK. D'ARMEES' and regimental cachet
or, alternatively, the signature of the local postmaster.
Specimens of all of these are shown.

The limited time at my disposal does not permit me to do more than touch upon the
highlights of the subsequent issues of New Caledonia. The display, however, contains a
fairly representative showing of them.
Of the 1900 issue, there are some uncatalogued varieties of the '15' (cents) in circle surcharged
on the 30c. cartouche type.

Also a stamp on which the '15' (cents) in circle has been surcharged on a 4c. cartouche
type. Some say that by mistake, a sheet of the 4c. became mixed up with the sheets of 30c.,
while others think that it was an unissued provisional


Of the 1902 provisional, specimens can be seen of the 'N C E 5' (cents) surcharged
on the 2c. cartouche stamp and the 'N C E 15' (Cents) surcharged also on the 2c. cartouche
value, which the authorities, fearing forgeries, never put into circulation.

A local paqueboat service had come into being, connecting up the numerous harbours
that are around the island, and specimens of the special cachet: 'SCE. (Service) MME.
(Maritime). COTE-OUEST are displayed.

\subsection{The First Pictorials}
New Caledonia's first pictorial set came out in 1905-7. It includes a bird, called the {{wi:kagu}}, found only on that island and which, though possessing fully-fledged wings, never flies.

\ph[99%]{../new-caledonia/1905.jpg}{
Yvert 88/101 * / MH / Avec charniere / M/M Nouvelle Caledonie $11.30.}

Two constant errors, namely a broken coast line, (fifth row), and a broken hillside (seventh
row), occur in the view of the Pointe Des Paletuviers in the 1928 40 pictorial set.

The island's first airmail stamps, commemorating the Paris to Noumea flight in 1932
by De Verneilh, Deve and Munch, took the form of an overprint on two values (40c. and
50c.) of the previous issue.

\begin{marginfigure}

\caption{1941 France Libre overprinted stamp. Yvert 211}
\end{marginfigure}
In 1941, in line with other colonies of France, the mammoth 'France Libre' set, consisting
of thirty-five overprinted values, was issued, recording adherence to General de Gaulle.


During the next year (1942), Harrison & Sons produced by photogravure, to the drawings
of Edmund Dulac, another 'Free French' set, featuring the flightless kagu and embodying
in the design the Cross of Lorraine.

\ph[99%]{../new-caledonia/1942-france-libre.jpg}{

With the war over, Vaugirard in Paris produced by photogravure in 1948 a most colourful
pictorial issue designed by J. Douy, including three striking, high-value, airmail stamps.
They form an arresting splash of colour in the frames. A cover that went by the first aerial flight via Sydney, the Netherlands Indies and Saigon to France is also there.

The Centenary of French Administration in 1953 was celebrated by four exceptionally fine
portrait stamps, de luxe proofs of which are displayed. First, there is Admiral d'Entrecasteaux,
who, in his search for the lost navigator La Perouse, explored the Northern coast of
New Caledonia. The two frigates are the Recherche and the Esperance.
Next, also designed and engraved by Pheulpin, is a portrait of Monseigneur Douarre,
the first missionary in New Caledonia and its apostolic vicar.
Thirdly, designed and engraved by Hertenberger, is Admiral D'Urville, who charted the
northern coast of New Caledonia.
Lastly, there is Admiral DesPointes, who on 24th September, 1853 took possession of the
island in the name of France. The designer and engraver was Gaudon.

You will also see displayed die proofs and colour trials of various other pictorial, recess printed,
miscellaneous issues that came out in the middle 1950's.

The tropical flora, coral and fish sets, of which die proofs and blocks are shown, attained a high degree of philatelic artistry and the three airmail stamps issued in 1959, depicting a native throwing a fishing net, the hydro-electric dam at Yate and the carved rock at Bourail, deserve particular commendation. They were all P. 13 or P. 12 1/2.

This review concludes with the commemorative, recess-printed, set issued in 1960 to
celebrate the Centenary of Postal Services in New Caledonia, the die proofs of which merit
examination in the frames.

Forming part of that set is a redrawn 'Type Triquera' head of Napoleon III, the die
proof of which is here together with two centenary stamps that reproduce Triquera's
drawing of Port de France a century ago.

On the higher of those two values (33 F.) Triquera's name is printed vertically at the
bottom of the left-hand side of the stamp, and, to complete this paper and display, I now
hand round a photograph of his original drawing, from which the design on those two
stamps was copied, and which appeared in the 'Moniteur Imperial' on 27th September, 1859.
