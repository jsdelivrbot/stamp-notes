\subsection{Fernando Po}

The first stamps of the island of Fernando Po were issued in 1868 by the Spanish colonial authorities in the capital Santa Isabel.

Issues continued for a century until 1968 when the colony was incorporated into Spanish Guinea. Fernando Po (since renamed Bioko) is now part of Equatorial Guinea.

\subsection{Rio Muni}

From 30 July 1959 to 11 October 1968 Rio Muni was treated as a separate overseas province of Spain until it combined again with Fernando Poo to form Equatorial Guinea on 12 October 1968. The first stamps of Rio Muni were issued on 27 April 1960.[1]
Residents of R\`iÂ­o Muni originally used the postage stamps of Spanish Guinea until 1960 when the Spanish government decreed the use of separate issues for R\`iÂ­o Muni and Fernando Po (Bioko). The first definitive series appeared in that year, consisting of nine values, 25 c to 10 p, all with the same design showing a missionary and a native boy reading, and inscribed "RIO MUNI".

Issues from 1961 on added the inscription "ESPANA"; typically two to three issues per year, consisting of two to four stamps each, and usually depicting local plants and animals. Another definitive series appeared in 1964, also with nine values.
The last issue of R\`iÂ­o Muni was a set of three signs of the zodiac issued on 25 April 1968.

\subsection{Independence}

Spanish Guinea became an independent republic on 12 October 1968 and its first stamps as such were issued on that date.[1]

Many colourful stamps have been issued since then, usually designed more to appeal to overseas stamp collectors than for domestic use.
