# An Introduction to the Stamps and Postal Hstory of Wallis and Futuna

The Wallis and Futuna Islands are a Polynesian French island territory in the South Pacific Ocean between [Tuvalu](../tuvalu/Introduction) to the northwest, Rotuma of Fiji to the west and the main part of [Fiji](../fiji/Introduction) to the southwest.

The total population of the territory at the July 2008 census was 13,484 (68.4% on the island of Wallis, 31.6% on the island of Futuna), down from 14,944 at the July 2003 census.[9] The vast majority of the population are of Polynesian ethnicity, with a small minority of Metropolitan French descent and/or native-born whites of French descent. More than 16,000 Wallisians and Futunians live as expatriates in [New Caledonia](../new-caledonia/Introduction), which is more than the total population of Wallis and Futuna.

The Islands were discovered  by Captain Samuel Wallis in 1767. The French influence was brought by missionaries in 1837 and the indigenous population was converted by P\`ere Bataillon to catholiscism. 

 In 1842 the French government would not agree to
a request for a protectorate. but from 1843 the kings of the islands
were advised by a French resident. The Third Republic was.
however, willing to accept the burden of empire and the
islands were made a  French ProtectorateÂ·

All were attached to New Caledonta for administrative purposes on
27 November 1888. Special issues of stamps began in 1920.
