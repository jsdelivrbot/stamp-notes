\section{Lusignan Period}


Postal history material for both the Lusignan, Venetian and early Ottoman periods exist in the form of entires. Whatever letters were carried on internal
routes may not bear postal markings. These were carried on muleback and on horseback. Letters before the 1400's are very few and scarce.
