It is not very often that someone can find a Cinderella stamp from the First World War for Cyprus. This is one of them, mint and with gum at the back. Curious to find out a bit more about it? The writing is in Italian and has the message "Comitato di preparazione Civilie", Nicosis 1917. Some form for committee for Civil Defense. Why in Italian? Which was the committee? They will remain mysterious until someone comes up with a reference and an explanation. The mysteries of the more esoteric part of philately.
