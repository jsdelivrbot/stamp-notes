### Mule Pack Transport Company


Though not directly partaking in frontline combat, the Cyprus Regiment provided essential equipment, food and much needed support in the many theatres of war. A total of six Mule Pack Transport Companies were formed and saw action in:
France,  Dunkirk, East Africa Eritrea, Sudan, Ethiopia
Middle East  Syria against Vichy France
North Africa  Egypt
Greece  Crete
Italy/Sicily  Cassino.

These covers are very difficult to find as the Regiment consisted only about 600 volunteers. (I actually only seen these ones but I am sure there are a few around).
Two of my uncles served in the War, the one got killed in Italy and the other survived the War married an English woman and eventually emigrated to Australia.

Once the Regiment was evacuated from Dunkirk it was move to Mowbray. By now the address was maked in manuscript "Remount Service." The principle function of the Remount Service during peacetime was to procure, process, train, and issue horses, mules, and dogs (1942-1948) for military use and to train personnel in animal management. It was also responsible for purchase of forage for these animals. Another function of the Remount Service was that of supervising the Army horse breeding program designed to raise the quality of horses.

The Remount Service's principle functions during war were to supply replacement riding horses and the draft animals required to haul ammunition, water, food, and heavy artillery and to evacuate the wounded.   Motorization and mechanization in the 1930s reduced the need for animals, but did not make them completely obsolete.

Lord Lloyd did not look very impressed and as you can see the Regiment by now was very thin. The photo is courtesy of [iwm](http://media.iwm.org.uk/iwm/mediaLib/37/media-37902/large.jpg?action=d)

The next stop appears to be in Egypt at Genufa camp. I still have not managed to
find any information on this camp.

The letters were probably cherished by Petrou and returned with him to Cyprus. I am not too sure how they found their way into a Turkish Cypriot collector who eventually sold them on ebay and ended up in my collection. Unlike most of the
other items I have not put an estimated cost figures for these, they are priceless
and I will see if I can eventually donate them at a museum. The condition of the first covers is very poor but they are probably unique items.

Originally, even before the war broke out, there was a plan to enlist Cypriots in the British army and an infantry battalion was planned. This was abandoned in March 1939 and it was decided instead to raise units for the RASC, the Royal Engineers and other services of the British Army. When the war broke out 500 Cypriots enlisted immediately in the RASC and formed Mule Transport Companies and sent to France. these were the the first Cypriot units to be formed and the first colonial or commonwealth troops, if you prefer, to take the field against the enemy. 't is important to note that the Cypriot personnel at that stage of the war were unarmed. Thus when the front collapsed all Cypriot personnel were ordered to head to Dunkirk for evacuation, while the armed British personnel joined ad-hoc fighting units. They were evacuated from Dunkirk on the 29th May 1940. Once in the UK the Cypriot AT Drivers were armed and retrained and played their part in coastal defence. 

In the meanwhile back in Cyprus, the Cyprus Regiment was formed in February 1940 and initially included Infantry, Transport and Pioneers. 

The Cyprus Defense Force was created for the defense of the island against a German invasion (an idea abandoned by the Germans probably after their huge losses in Crete) and its volunteers were not supposed to serve outside Cyprus. Eventually a large number of the personnel of the CDF joined the Cyprus Regiment and served mainly in the Middle East and Italy. 

Around 20,000 Cypriots volunteered and enlisted in the British Forces most of them joining the Cyprus Regiment but also other British regiments and Corps (including the ex-president of Cyprus Glafkos Clerides who served with the RAF Bomber Command)- and taken POW when his bomber plane was shot down over Germany). 

Furthermore other Cypriots had already joined the Greek army and later the Greek resistance. This contribution cannot be underestimated since it represents roughly 10% of the male population of the island at that time, both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, (as well as members of other Cypriot communities). Some 600 men were killed in action or are still considered missing, and more than 2,500 were taken POWs during the evacuation of Greece and Crete, mostly Pioneers. (Cypriot veterans still bitterly complain that the British abandoned them in Greece to save their own troops  I guess from a military point of view and under the circumstances that was the right thing to do i.e. giving priority for evacuation to frontline troops). 

Also some 1,000 women had enlisted voluntarily to the ATS and the WAAF and served in the Middle East .

The Animal Transport Companies and the General Transport companies of the Cyprus Regiment operated under the RASC. Notably the AT Companies, provided excellent services under the most difficult conditions during the battle of Keren and later at Monte Cassino where they daily supplied the Poles having to drive their mules for many miles every night under shell, machine  gun and mortar fire. Mules were the only means to deliver the much needed supplies and ammunition that the Cypriot AT Drivers dumped right at the frontline positions. On the equally dangerous return journey they evacuated the wounded. Many men and animals by the way - were killed during those journeys.

The General Transport and Pioneer Companies served in the Middle East, Greece, Crete, Ethiopia and Italy but their most notable participation was in Operation Compass as  Corps troops (originally the WDF).
