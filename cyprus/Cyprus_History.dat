##CYPRUS UNDER THE TURKS 



###INTRODUCTORY 

As chronicles of the three hundred years during 
which Cyprus was ruled by the dynasty of 
Lusignan are abundant, so are the records of 
the three hundred years of Turkish domination 
scanty, despite the fact that the Turks continued 
to rule Cyprus until 1878. But the explanation 
is simple. The three centuries during which 
the island was governed by the kings and queens 
of the House of Lusignan were the most brilliant 
epoch of its varied history. In every aspect of 
mediaeval civilization the little kingdom played 
a distinguished part ; its remarkable achievements 
in every domain of human activity invested it 
with an importance among the nations of Europe 
wholly out of proportion to its small size and 
population. Its constitution was the model 
of that of the mediaeval feudal state ; its laws, 
as embodied in the Assizes of Jerusalem, a pattern 
of mediaeval jurisprudence. It could boast, in ' 
the abbey of Bella Paise, in the cathedrals of 
Nicosia and Famagusta, in the castles of 
{{wi:St._Hilarion}}, {{wi:Buffavento}}, and {{wi:Kantara}},
rarely beautiful examples of Gothic architecture ; its men of 
letters, Philippe de Novare, Guillaume de 
Machaut, Philippe de Mezieres, occupied no 
undistinguished place in the realm of literature. 
In King Peter I it possessed perhaps the great^t 
knight-errant the world has ever seen ; in his 
Order of the Sword the most perfect expression 
of chivalrous ideals. To Kings of Cyprus such 
widely different writers as S. Thomas Aquinas 
and Boccaccio dedicated works ; the wealth and 
luxury of its citizens, especially in the fourteenth 
century, evoked the amazement of all Western 
visitors. Moreover, jifter the fall of Acre in 
12915 Cyprus was the outpost of Latin Christen- 
dom in the East, With all the glamour and glory 
that such a circumstance involved ; while for 
a time the trade and riches , of Famagusta vied 
in importance with those of Venice, An efopee 
of this kind could not fail to .find its singers. 

The history of Turkish rule, on the other hand, 
offers none of the attractions of the wonderful 
epoch which was separated from it only by the 
eighty- two years of the Venetian occupation.

It reveals no tale of martial exploits and fabulous 
wealth, no efflorescence of Frankish art and letters 
on the rich Levantine soil. Rather is it a story 
of provincialism and decay, of contractirig com- 
merce and unenterprising administration, a story 
not regal but parochial. Only at rare intervals 
does a picturesque incident interrupt the {{wi:sonilescence}} in which Cyprus lay after her feverish 
activities of the Middle Ages ; from being a kingdom renowned throughout Christendom the island 
was become an obscure Ottoman dependency. 

Thus it is that the records of Turkish rule in 
Cyprus are few. Its solitary chronicler, the 
Archimandrite Kyprianos, published his history 
of his native island in 1788 ; for the ninety years 
yet to elapse before the British occupation we 
have nothing in print beyond the descriptions 
of occasional travellers, and sundry references 
in histories of Greece to the rising of 1821. 
There exist, however, in the island certain archives 
of the British Consulate in Cyprus, beginning in 
1 7 ID, and continuing, intermittently, until the 
abohtion of the Consulate, consequent upon 
the British occupation, in 1878. These archives, 
examined here for the first time, enable us to 
fill, partially at all events, a gap in the history 
of Cyprus, which the island's distinguished past 
and promising future should no longer suffer 
to remain. 

The documents contained in the archives are 
varied both in language and in their subject 
matter. Dating back to the time when the 
English Consuls in Turkey were appointed by 
the Levant Company, and ending with the British 
occupation of Cyprus, they serve not only to 
shed light on the internal history of the island 
during this period, but to illustrate the manner 
in which events taking place in other countries 
reacted upon and were echoed in what in the 
early nineteenth century was still called _il regno di Cipro_.

Few of them, except in the years 
immediately preceding the British occupation, 
are in the English language. The Ottoman 
officials, in their communications with the Con- 
sular Corps, employed either Turkish, or, in 
occasional informal letters, Greek ; the Consuls 
generally wrote in Italian, sometimes in French ; 
included in the archives is correspondence in 
Arabic and in Armenian. The task of examining 
more than 10,000 documents, in seven languages, 
was thus no light one, the more so as bad hand- 
writing, faded ink, and other ravages of time 
have rendered the majority of them difficult to 
decipher. I have preserved, in quoting, the 
inaccuracies and eccentricities of spelling and 
punctuation of the originals (when not translated), 
except where so to do would have been to obscure 
the sense ; and it will be remarked that the 
authors of not a few letters were by no means 
masters of the languages they wrote in. Many 
of the papers examined proved, of course, co 
be of no general interest. The earlier ones, 
in particular, are mainly concerned with the 
disputes of British subjects and protected subjects, 
which came before the Consul in his magisterial 
capacity, and with shipping questions. These 
are of no importance, but, as the following ex- 
amples indicate, are occasionally amusing :

The archives are unfortunately very incomplete, 
but they recall, nevertheless, many political 
changes in Europe, and register the rise and fall 
of dynasties and nations. Correspondence there 
is with the Citizen Consul of the French Re- 
public, one and indivisible, at Latakia, of the 
month Messidor of the year IV ; to the French 
Commissaire in Cyprus succeeds the Imperial 
Consul of France, to him the Consul of His 
Most Christian Majesty the King of France and 
Navarre. Qn the seals of French Consular docu- 
ments appear successively the Angel of the 
Revolution, the Imperial Eagle, the fleur-de-lis 
of the ancien regime the hideous coat of arms 
inflicted upon Louis Philippe, the roi bourgeois. 

The representative in Cyprus of their High 
Mightinesses the States-General of the United 
Provinces becomes for a while the Consul for 
the {[wi:Batavian_Republic}} before settling down as 
Consul for the Kingdom of the Netherlands, 
Of the ephemeral Kingdom of Westphalia there 
is fleeting mention, also of the Kingdoms of 
Denmark and Norway in now unfamiliar com- 
bination. The English Consul corresponded 
frequently on shipping matters with the Consuls 
of the Holy Roman Empire and of the Kingdom 
of the Two Sicilies, also with the representative 
of " Sa Majeste Sarde," still titular sovereign, 
through Queen Charlotte of the House* of 
Lusignan, of the Kingdom of Cyprus. There 
was much business with the " United States of 
the Ionian Islands," some with the Dey of Algiers 
and with the Bey of Tunis ; and there are allu- 
sions, as we shall see, to vessels that flew the flag 
of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. 

Of correspondence between the English Consuls and the local 
authorities in Cyprus there 
survives but little prior to the accession of Sultan 
'Abdu'l Mejid in 1839 ; the most interesting 
of the papers of the early years of the nineteenth 
century are the private letters which passed 
between Consul Vondiziano and Bartolommeo {{{wi:Pisani}},
member of a family long connected with 
the British Embassy to the Porte. Of all the 
archives, however, those likely to prove most 
valuable to the future historian of Cyprus are 
probably three important despatches, which were 



8 INTRODUCTORY 

addressed by Vice-Consul {{wi:Sandwith}} to the 
Ambassador in Constantinople between 1867 
and 1869. These admirably informative docu- 
ments, reproduced in full in Chapter III, provide 
us with authoritative details as to the condition 
and administration of Cyprus towards the end 
of the Ottoman dominion ; they are, in fact, 
the only source of knowledge of this period, 
other than the Consular reports issued between 
1857 and 1878, and such Turkish records as may 
lie forgotten in the pigeon-holes of Stambul. 

Although English trade in Cyprus declined 
visibly after the disappearance of the Levant 
Company, it is satisfactory to read in a German 
traveller's account of his visit to Cyprus in 184,5 
that ^ among the European consulates the English 
certainly takes the most distinguished position, 
although the English commerce is quite un- 
important. The English here as elsewhere in 
the East are at some pains to exact as much 
consideration as possible.' ^ After 1825, however, 
the persons with whose interests the British 
Consuls in Cyprus were entrusted were almost 
wholly British- protected subjects of Ionian 
origin. For Cephalonians and Xanthiotes in par- 
ticular Cyprus at one time seems to have held 
many attractions ; and a bundle of Ionian pass- 
ports included in the archives, issued by the 
^ Lord Alto Commissario ' of the Ionian Islands, 
and endorsed * cancelled, as bearers have been 
proved to be rayahs,' indicates the widespread

desire of lonians to reside in Cyprus under 
British protection. To judge from the records 
of the Consular Chancery, the lonians in Cyprus 
were a litigious and quarrelsome little community, 
a prey to petty jealousies, and prone to be 
sceptical as to each other's commercial probity. 
They lived principally at Larnaca, which has 
always been the residence of the Consular Corps, 
and which, under Turkish rule, was also the lead- 
ing port in the island, the seat of the Tijaret or 
Commercial Court, and the head- quarters of the 
Sanitary, Quarantine, and Customs Administra- 
tion. Indeed, Larnaca owed its commercial 
predominance during this period to the fact 
that here dwelt the small but wealthy body 
of Roman Catholics (generally known in the 
Near East as Latins), who virtually monopolized 
the foreign trade of the island. While of varied 
descent — French, Ionian, Venetian, Genoese, 
Maltese, Syrian — the members of this body 
were under the protection of Great Britain, 
France, or some other European Power, and most 
of the European Consular representatives were 
chosen from among them. Enjoying the privi- 
leges of Franks, and exempt from the disabilities 
to which the rayahs were liable, the Latin mer- 
chants of Cyprus had a strong pull over the 
Orthodox Cypriote merchants ; Larnaca at this 
time far exceeded in prosperity the Orthodox 
Limasol. But when, at the British occupation, 
the Capitulations ceased to be operative in 
Cyprus, the position was reversed. The Latin 
merchants, no longer favoured by the Capitula- 
tions, had now to compete on equal terms with 
the more numerous Orthodox, no longer r ayahs ; 
and their commercial supremacy, undisputed 
in the period dealt with in this volume, was at 
an end.

##CHAPTER I 

###TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS, 1571-1788 

While the existence of an English Consulate in 
Cyprus is first heard of in 1626, its archives in 
the island, with a few isolated exceptions, date 
back, no farther than the latter half of the 
eighteenth century. We have thus no contem- 
porary series of records from British official 
sources of the condition of the country during 
the first two centuries of Turkish rule, although 
we are fortunate in the possession of the narra- 
tives of Pococke ^ and other travellers, and of the 
unofiicial notes of Drummond^ and de Vezin,' 
both of whom held the ofiice of His Britannic 
Majesty's Consul for Aleppo and Cyprus. It 
would be superfluous to transcribe here these 
valuable accounts of the state of Cyprus, seeing 
that their relevant chapters, together with ex- 
tracts from the works of close on eighty other 
writers about Cyprus* have been made readily 
accessible in a single volume by the industry of 
the late Mr. Cobham.* On the other hand, 
it would seem necessary, in order to render 
intelligible the period covered by the archives, 
to include within the scope of this work some 
account of the history of Cyprus from the Turkish 
conquest to the time when the Consular docu- 
ments begin to speak for themselves. It so 
happens that the Archimandrite Kyprianos, sole 
chronicler of Turkish Cyprus, brings his history 
of his native land^ down to the end of 1788, 
the year of its publication — ^that is to say, almost 
exactly to the date of the earliest regular archives ; 
it is on his pages, therefore, as translated by 
Cobham, that we have principally to rely for 
the record of the period to be bridged.

For a brief sketch of the history of Cyprus 
prior to the Turkish conquest the reader is re- 
ferred to the Handbook of Cyprus; nor need the 
designs on the island of {{wi:Sultan_Selim_II}}, the 
incidents of its conquest by his General, Lala 
Mustafa, and of the heroic defence of Nicosia 
and Famagusta, detain us here. Our story 
begins with Bragadino's surrender of Famagusta 
on August 6, 1571, the date on which the 
Venetians in Cyprus ceased all further opposition to the 
Turkish army of invasion ; and only 
those earlier events will be recalled which are 
necessary to explain how the Turkish conquest 
affected the status of the Cypriote population. 
It has been the fate of Cyprus, almost through-

out its long history, to be governed by rulers 
differing in race and religion from the bulk of 
its inhabitants. Although the island, owing 
to its geographical situation, had received the 
impress of many peoples and many civilizations, 
its most enduring element, in speech and blood, 
proved to be that imported by the Ionian settlers ; 
and to the time of the Turkish conquest the native 
population, except for small Latin, Maronite, 
Coptic, Jacobite, and Armenian colonies, was 
Greek in religion and in language. The last 
Greek-speaking ruler of the island disappeared, 
however, in 1191, with Isaac Comnenus's ephe- 
meral Empire of Cyprus ; between then and 
1 571 the island was in the hands of a small ruling 
class of Latins, French in the Lusignan period 
and Italian in the Venetian, superimposed upon 
the Greek-speaking and Orthodox Cypriotes. 
Socially, the principal characteristic of the Lusig- 
nan Kingdom, brilliant as it was if regarded solely 
from a Prankish standpoint, was the state of 
serfdom in which the native peasantry was main- 
tained for the benefit of the French feudal 
nobility. Ecclesiastically, the policy of the 
Lusignans was to effect the subordination of the 
autocephalous Orthodox Church of the people 
to the Church of the ruling race. Roman 
Catholic sees were endowed with property taken 
from the Orthodox bishoprics ; and a series of 
acts of oppression culminated in 1260 in the issue 
by Pope Alexander IV of the famous Bulla 
Cypria^ whereby the Latin Archbishop was 
made the supreme ecclesiastical chief of Latins 



14 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

and Orthodox alike. All tithes were made over 
to the Latin clergy ; the Orthodox Archbishopric 
was suppressed ; and such of the Orthodox 
bishops as were suffered to continue were 
relegated to distant villages, and compelled to 
take an oath of obedience to the Latin bishops 
who had ousted them. The Venetians, whose 
eighty-two years of rule in Cyprus were Httle 
more than a military occupation, preserved the 
principles upon which their predecessors, the 
Lusignans, had governed the island ; so that it 
is no cause for wonder that the Orthodox turned 
to the Sultan for ' that deUverance which they 
seem never to have quite despaired of eventually 
obtaining ' ; and that, on the arrival of the 
Turks, ' the Greek inhabitants everywhere readily 
welcomed the invading forces, once a prospect 
of getting rid of the detested Latins seemed 
really to have come at last.'' Contemporaries 
such as Gratiano, Bishop of Amelia,' eye-witnesses 
such as Fra Angelo Calepio,' Superior of the 
Cypriote Dominicans, who was taken prisoner 
by the Turks after the capture of Nicosia, bear 
testimony to the sympathy which the Turkish 
received from the Cypriotes ; the latter

standard of S. Mark and hoisted in its place the 
Ottoman ensign. 

The conquerors, for their part, while showing 
no mercy to the Latins, treated the Cypriotes 
with the consideration that their goodwill toward 
them had merited. . They assured to them the 
free enjoyment of their religion, with the undis- 
turbed possession of their churches ; gave them 
permission to acquire houses and land, with 
the power of transmission to their heirs; and 
recognized the supremacy of the Orthodox 
community over all other Christian denomina- 
tions in the island. So uncompromising a hater 
of the Turks as Kyprianos is compelled to admit 
that:

the Greeks, who to a certain extent pre- 
ferred to be subject to the Ottoman, rather than 
to a Latin, power, were even glad in their 
wretchedness, because so far as concerned their 
rites and customs, they escaped the tyranny of 
the Latins.' * 

In view of the long series of sub- 
sequent complaints, in part well founded, of 
Turkish misgovernment in Cyprus, it is well 
to bear in mind that at the very outset of their 
administration the Turks granted to the Orthodox 
inhabitants two boons far outweighing the 
drawbacks of oppressive taxation and partial 
administration of justice. They abolished serfdom, under which the peasantry had groaned 
even during the Byzantine domination ; and 
they restored the Orthodox Archbishopric, which 
a Christian Church had caused to be in abeyance 
for three hundred years. Those who for centuries had been mere bondmen on the soil
were now on payment of a trifling sum constituted its possessors, with the right of succession 
to their descendants.' This was a change in 
the status of the majority of the population far 
greater than any they had known before ; and 
the restoration of the Archbishopric had results 
almost equally important. 

/ szys 
Hackett, the historian of the Church of Cyprus, 
^ Excerpta Cypria, p. 348. 







The Church of Cyprus, while forming, like 
the Churches of Russia, Greece, Serbia, and 
some ten others, a portion of the * Holy Ortho- 
dox Eastern Church,' is, as are those Churches, 
'autocephalous and isotimous.' It enjoys, that 
is to say, the right of electing its own head, the 
Archbishop, and it is independent of outside 
ecclesiastical authority. Next, in fact,- to the 
four original Patriarchates of Constantinople, 
Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, the Cypriote 
Church is the senior of the autocephalous 
Churches, owing this position to its Apostolic 
foundation by S. Paul and S. Barnabas, and to 
the confirmation of its independence by the 
Emperor Zeno in the year 478. On this occasion 
Zeno conferred upon the Cypriote Primate cer- 
tain privileges enjoyed by no other ectlesiastic, 
privileges which have been jealously retained to 
the present day. They include the right of 
signing in red ink, a prerogative shared only 
with the Emperor himself, of wearing a cope 
of imperial purple, and of carrying an imperial 
sceptre in place of a pastoral staff ; whence it will 
be seen that the Archbishop of Cyprus, though 
his Church was small, enjoyed an exceptional 
position in the Orthodox world. 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 17 


During the Turkish regime the Archbishop 
represented to his own flock on a smaller scale 
that which the Patriarch of Constantinople 
represented to the generality of the Orthodox 
in Turkey. That is to say, he was not only the 
spiritual chief of the Cypriotes ; he became the 
{[wi:ethnarch}}, the political and national representative 
of his people in its relations with the Ottoman 
Government. By an astonishing reversal of 
fortune the Archbishops of Cyprus, whose office 
had been recreated by the Turks after lying 
dormant for three hundred years, secured, in the 
course of the seventeenth and eighteenth cen- 
turies, the supreme power and authority over 
the island, and at one time wielded influence 
greater than that ot the Turkish Pasha himself. 
How they achieved this result will, however, be 
described later ; we must now revert to the 
consideration of the measures whereby the Turks 
consolidated their hold upon their new conquest. 

No serious attempts were made by any Christian State to challenge the Turkish occupation 
of Cyprus. At the beginning of the seventeenth 
century certain of the Orthodox hierarchy and 
clergy appealed in a half-hearted way to two 
Italian princes, Charles Emmanuel of Savoy 
(1580-1630) and Ferdinand I, Grand Duke of 
Tuscany (15 87-1 609), both of whom laid claim 
to the titular crown of Cyprus in virtue of their 
relationship to the last legitimate sovereign of 
the House of Lusignan, Queen Charlotte, married 



i8 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

in 1459 to Louis of Savoy. The efforts of the 
Duke of Savoy went little farther than secret 
negotiations with the Archbishop of Cyprus as 
to the conditions upon which the Cypriotes 
would be prepared to recognize him as their 
sovereign. In 1601 the Duke received through 
his envoy Accidas a document of twenty-four 
articles, containing the terms of the people of 
Cyprus,' and in his reply he announced to the 
Archbishop his intention of sending two other 
emissaries to Nicosia to continue the negotiations. 

Soon after, however, more important matters 
nearer home diverted his attention from Cyprus ; 
and although in 1632, and again in 1668, the Court 
of Turin was approached by Cypriote ecclesiastics 
with schemes for the expulsion of the Turks, 
nothing definite resulted from their overtures. 

The Grand Duke of Tuscany was somewhat more 

^rtivf ifi the matter,' and in 1607 actually 
I an expedition. But his fleet, ' instead 
ing Famagusta seriously, merely degener- 
I a piratical raid in the Levantine Sea, 
)urse of which a sum of more than two 
lucats was secured by the capture of a 
caravan from Alexandria. All through 
iteenth and eighteenth centuries plots 
mes were proposed for the recapture of 
Cyprus, but no serious attempt was ever made

by any European Power after this futile cruise 
of the Tuscan fleet in the summer of 1607. 

Let us now turn to the narrative of the Archi- 
mandrite Kyprianos, bearing in mind that this 
zealous lover of his country lived in the latter 
half of the eighteenth century, and that by this 
time the Orthodox Cypriotes, chafing under 
Turkish maladministration, had forgotten the 
tyranny from which the Turks had freed them. 

* After the unhappy surrender of Ammo- 
chostos * on August 6, 1571 — I ought rather to 
call it the general captivity and enslavement of 
such of the wretched Cypriots as survived — 
Mustafa Pasha, the General Commanding in 
Chief of the conquering army, received, before 
sailing for Constantinople, from Sultan Selim II, 
commands to organize and arrange with all speed 
such matters as the safety of the island required, 
and then to sail for the capital. At Ammochostos 
he set up as governor a certain Bey of Rhodes, 
Forca Framburaro, a Spaniard and renegade, 
and, as the common tradition of the island asserts, 
a Pasha of two tails : At Paphos another Pasha 
of two tails ; and at Nicosia as being the former 
royal residence and seat of government, Muzaffar, 
a Pasha of three tails, and of higher rank than the 
others. To him was entrusted the general govern- 
ment of the island.

* Mustafa now returned to Levkosia/ and 
ordered that a census should at once be taken 
of the inhabitants (in Turkish rVaya or left) 
remaining in Cyprus. In making this census 
of the viUages and their inhabitants, he not only 
used the books and accounts of the Latin sove- 
reigns, to discover how much revenue the island 
yielded to the royal treasury, but examined cer- 
tain unhappy Cypriots, once chiefs among their 
fellows, who after the sack of Nicosia came down 
from the mountains, and surrendered as rVaya^ 
to wit — Scipio Caraffa, Peter Paul Syncleticos, 
Tuzio Constanzd, Livio Podocataro, Giovanni 
Muscorno, Orsatto Lusignan or Lazania, Gian- 
netto and Ettore de Nores, and others who had 
been captured and freed on payment and on 
condition of remaining rVaya. To these, the 
story goes, he left their property, and even 
enrolled some in the army, though it is doubtful 
indeed if he would have taken Greeks as sipaht, 
for we know the hatred the Turks bear to other 
races, and their distrust of Christians, especially 
such as they have conquered in war. Neverthe- 
less the Parici and Perpiriarii, who were slaves 
of the chiefs and upper classes, who could not 
own land, and whose very selves and children 
were their masters' property, never ceased to 
help the Turks, for they hoped under their 
yoke to find freedom and rest. They made known 
to the commission of inquiry and to the Pasha 
the revenues, estates, villages, and even in detail 
the families in each village and their houses.

And the Levkarites, who were among the first 
to submit, paid this homage of their own accord, 
and received, it is said, certain exemptions 
therefor. When the inquiry was complete there was 
found a taxable popiilation, from fourteen years 
old to fifty, Greeks, Armenians, Maronites, 
Copts, and other races, of about 85,000, not 
reckoning women, children, and old men. 

Before 
the capture there was a total population, as we 
learn from the historian Coronelli, of 197,000 
souls, so that we may accept the statement that 
after the Turkish occupation 18,000 taxable 
males were entered in the registers. Leave 
then was given to these people at a very small 
ransom to hold land, and to cultivate it as their 
own, and without further charge to hand it down 
to their children, being bound only to pay the 
so-called third of the produce, which varied 
according to the locality, and might be a fifth 
or seventh or eighth or tenth. The inhabitants 
were further divided into three classes, as the 
order stands now, and (as many believe) has 
stood from of old. Men of the first class paid 
each a yearly poll-tax or kharaj of eleven piastres. 
Those of the second and less prosperous class 
paid five and a half ; the poorest or third class 
three piastres only. But Fra Vincenzo Coronelli, 
the official geographer of Venice, writing of the 
island after the Turkish conquest, says that the 
Cypriot rayah was made to pay six piastres for 
the privilege of following his religion. And Fra 
Angelo Calepio, a native of Levkosia, who was 



22 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

taken captive in the siege of that city, and wrote 
an account of the two sieges, says much the 
same. It appears that over eight hundred 
villages were entered on the hst, probably 
as thinly inhabited then as we have known 
them. 

* And as at that time there was great dearth 
in the island, because the land was left unsown 
on account of the war, and especially the Mesaor- 
ian plain, which had been wasted by the enemy's 
forays, Mustafa Pasha, by command of the Sultan, 
disbanded his numerous regiments, and sent 
the men to their homes ; those only remained 
who were rewarded for their bravery with pen- 
sions, and others who wished to settle in Cyprus ; 
and, as Calepio says, and as he heard from others 
while a slave in Constantinople, about 20,000 
Turks remained as settlers : perhaps he means 
that, seeing the island so scantily inhabited, 
the Pasha left so many men as a colony rather 
than a garrison. 

' While this enumeration of the villages and 
inhabitants was in progress, he arranged a
military system necessary for the defence 
island. There were detailed for the whole 
irus 1,000 yenicheri^ with their command- 
5 yenicheri-agha, and another officer under 
le col-kiaya, the fourth in rank of the four 
of Levkosia, and twenty-eight chorbaji 
same corps, of whom fourteen were styled 
shi^ that is to say captains respectively 
rse and foot. He enrolled also 2,666

sifahi ^ under forty- two zaitn ; thirty- two of these 
were posted to the garrison of Levkosia, and ten 
to those of Ammochostos and Paphos. To the 
command of these zaiin and sifahi were appointed 
three superior officers called Alay Bey^ the chief 
of these being stationed at Levkosia, and the 

* The following is part of the note prefixed by Cobham to 
his extract from Kyprianos : 

' In the Qanun-Namehy or statistical code of the Empire, 
originally compiled by order of Sultan Suleiman I (i 520-1 566), 
the Province of Cyprus is entered as furnishing" 1,667 swords, 
of which 40 are ziamets, and the rest titnars. The begSy xainUy

are Icheili, Tarsus, Alayah, Sis or Khas. The following have 
a Salianehy or annual allowance from the Treasury, Kyrenia, 
Paphos, Famagusta and Nicosia. It is a large island, and con- 
tains 30,000 Moslem warriors, and 150,000 infidels." (See the 
Traveller's narrative, Seyyahat-Nameh of Evliya Efendi, 161 1- 
1680, translated by J. von Hammer, 4to, London, 1834, PP* 
93 and 104.) Sir P. Rycaut, in Knolles' Turkish History, 
6th ed., 1687, gives the figures rather differently, and adds " the 
government of Qibris hath a revenue of 500,650 aspers." 

* A zaim for every 5,000 aspers of rent, a timariot for every 
3,000, received from the Grand Signor, was required to bring 
into the field one horseman or jebeli. The rent of a zaim was 
always under 100,000 aspers : above that sum the fief would be 
that of a. sanjaq-bey. The rent of a timariot was always under 
20,000 ; above that sum the fief would be that of a zaim. The 
sifahi received their pay (12 to 100 aspers a day) direct from the 
Treasury. The yenicheri likewise received from the Treasury 
I to 12 aspers a day, with rations and uniform. Three aspers 
or aqches made a fara or medin^ 40 paras a piastre.' 

<!--24 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS--> 

other two, who were subordinate to him, at 
Ammochostos and Paphos. These are the two 
so-called ojaqs of the sipahi and yenicheri, that 
is to say the two corps of cavalry and infantry, 
to whose guardianship was committed the safety 
of the whole island. 

' To each corps was assigned its necessary pay. 
To the yenicheri each year 12,000 piastres, col- 
lected from twenty-four muqata^a, fiefs specially 
dedicated to this service, to wit, the Customs of 
Larnax, Lemesos, Paphos, Ammochostos and 
Kyrenia : the two Salines of Larnax and Lemesos, 
and sixteen villages, Ashia, Levconico, Tlnagrai, 
Kiades, EUa, Koilanion, Palaikythron, Kazaphani, 
Bitzada, Apalestra, Peristerona, Pege, Levka, 
Lemesos, Eski Shehr or Palaia Chora, Achera, 
Lapithos, and other besides. The land of these 
villages pays tithe on all its produce, and their 
inhabitants pay each one piastre yearly for the 
tax called spenza. To the same corps is assigned, 
'.isabliq, that is to say one of the chprbaji 
nnted to examine from time to time the 
ice of comestibles : the same officer seals 
ics of cotton, linen and wool : he is assisted 
5 yenicheri called yasaqji, and these too 
>me small duty on all loads which enter 
ave Levkosia. Other 2,000 piastres are 
d towards the yearly cost of this corps, 
ese are levied from the rents of the water 
icopi, Colossion and Levka, and from cer- 
iperial spenzai, payable here and there by 
ihabitants of particular villages. The 
: of this revenue, appointed solely for 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 25 

this duty, is the defterdar efendi^ the first in raiik 
of the four aghas of Levkosia. This officer had 
formerly a defterdar-kiaya, and seven villages for 
his personal pay, Peristerona near Morphou, 
Petia, Amiantus, Galata, Kalliana, Peristerona 
near Paphos, and Anogyra, from which he still 
receives a fifth of the produce, an eighth of the 
barley, and a spenza fixed at six piastres for each 
inhabitant. The aghas of Levkosia, or the 
richest of them, farm out the twenty-four fiefs 
(jnuqata^a) and, after the system called tadakhuly 
or anticipative encashment of three or even five 
years' dues, they clear four times as much, so that 
the 12,000 piastres mount up to 47,000 piastres 
a year. 

^ But of the cavalry corps, each division — 
sipahi and timar — was paid from the tithes of 
all the villages not assigned to the yenicheri, 
and from the annual spenza paid by their in- 
habitants. Besides these were two minor com- 
mands or sanjaqSy of Paphos and Carpasion, 
with an income of 10,000 piastres, perhaps for 
the maintenance of the Pashas of those districts. 
The sanjaq of Paphos was paid out of the tithes, 
spenza and garden tax of twenty-four villages 
in the two sub-districts of qaziliqs of Paphos 
and Abdim; that of Carpasion, in the same 
way, from seven villages of the qaziliqs of Ammo- 
chostos and Carpasion. But after a time, when 
these two pashaliqs were suppressed, and there 
remained only one Pasha at Nicosia as Governor- 
General of the island, the income from Ammo- 
chostos and Carpasion was dedicated to a mosque 



26 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

at Constantinople, under which it was farmed 
by notables of that city. And in the same way 
the so-called chiftliqs (farms) of Morphou, Polis 
tes Chrysochou, ana Kouklia, with their depend- 
ent villages, fourteen belonging to KouHia, 
seven to Polis : Morphou counting only its own 
inhabitants. The labourers of these chiftliqs 
pay only two Turkish florins apiece in imperial 
taxes. The Pasha of Levkosia used to take the 
revenue of the sanjaq of Paphos, as well as the 
pay of the defterdar-kiaya, the two making up 
9,000 piastres, which were collected from the 
muqata'a of the two villages of Zodias, and partly 
from other villages, for the office of defterdarkiaya 
had been suppressed long since as superfluous. 

' It appears moreover that the Turks were not 
satisfied with the old division of the island, as it 
stood under the Lusignan kings, into twelve 
districts, but redivided it into seventeen qaziliqs : 
with Orini, Kythraia, Mesaoria, 
ostos, Carpasion : Paphos, with Chry- 
Louklia, Avdimi : Larnax, with Lemesos, 
Koilanion : and Kyrenia, with Mor- 
mtagia and Levka. These comprised, 
re said before, 850 villages. Yet in this 
h century only 550 remain, and these 
5 thickly peopled than the older ones. 

re is little douot, was the oldest arrange- 
ler than the Christian kings, when the 
d tenfold as many inhabitants as now. 
Df five larger villages or towns on the 
was installed an officer called a dideban 
They were named by the Governor 


TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 27 

or Pasha for the time being, and were dependent 
on him. These were stationed at Larnax, 
Lemesos, Paphos, Kyrenia and Ammochostos, 
and paid yearly to the Governor 5,000 piastres. 
For the defence" of the coast from the incursions 
of corsairs or hostile vessels there were eleven 
serdars from the above-named corps, sent with 
the privity of the Governor, as well as others 
called disdarsy chosen to direct the defence 
of the fortresses of Ammochostos, Lemesos, 
Larnax, Paphos and Kyrenia. Thus you have, 
kind reader, a short of sketch, although not a 
very clear one, of the organization of this unhappy 
island from the Turkish conquest up to the 
present day. 

I am bound to say something too about the 
religious organization of the Turks in the island, 
at least as it exists at present. A molla is sent 
from Constantinople for perhaps a year or more 
as guardian and defender of the faith, and as 
judge in commercial disputes, differences, debt, 
damage and insult, in contracts of marriage and 
titles to houses and lands, with power to decide 
and to punish with forty stripes save one. Under 
his jurisdiction lie the five qaziliqs of Levkosia 
and Orini, Kythraia, Morphou, Pentagia and 
Carpasion, from whose inhabitants he receives 
a monthly salary. To the other qaziliqs are 
sent qazis of the class of readers of the Qoran, 
natives or strangers, who judge in the disputes 
of the inhabitants of the villages in their qaziliq, 
and receive from them a small monthly salary, 
for their own maintenance, and in repayment 



28 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

of the sum claimed either by the molla at Levkosia, 
or by the persons at Constantinople who have 
the right of farming out these offices. The 
whole monthly sum paid by them exceeds 2,000 
piastres, some paying less than 100, some more, 
according as their qaziliqs are thickly or sparsely 
peopled. What the molla receives and pays I 
do not know exactly, but I imagine that his yearly 
income exceeds 15,000 piastres, clear of all out- 
goings. 

* As we have already said, after the capture of 
Ammochostos, and up to the new harvest of the 
following year, 1572, there prevailed great and 
distressing dearth and famine, the result of the 
war ; although Mustafa Pasha, and others who 
were put in authority under him, tried to en- 
courage the peasants to sow, yet the result was 
small, because they had not sufficient seed. The 
very few Cypriots of the ruling classes who were 
left after the war gained their freedom somehow 
or other, but, like other citizens of Levkosia, 
were stripped of all their goods, and having no 
other way of gaining a -livelihood and the means 
of paying the poll-tax, became labourers and 
muleteers, hawking wine and the like from place 
to place, and selling it to get a living : a humble 
employment, and very different from their old 
stately condition. The inhabitants of Ammo- 
chostos remained in their houses, and appeared at 
the time to be the owners, yet afterwards the 
Turks dispossessed many of them, on the pretext 
that they were tenants only, not owners ; and 
thus they bore all the unimaginable ills which 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 29 

these new and bad neighbours could inflict upon 
them. . . . 

* At last, after the great calamity which had 
reduced the island to misery, somehow or other 
the poverty-stricken inhabitants began little by 
little to address themselves again to the culture 
of the soil, to some small commerce with strangers, 
and to those few arts which still survived in the 
towns. At the very beginning the dues and out- 
goings did not press so very hardly on the rayah, 
because the Porte knew how the country had been 
impoverished by the war : and the Pashas sent 
to govern it were to some extent controlled 
by the Porte, lest their harshness should drive 
the rayah to leave the island, or at least to revolt, 
for which his degraded condition would be an 
excuse. So that after fifteen or twenty years 
the Christians redeemed nearly all the monas- 
teries from those who had seized them, and much 
of the church lands as well. Churchmen of 
position left money for Masses for the repose of 
their souls, or bestowed it by way of gifts. 

Yet there were still a few who contrived 
somehow to escape from the island, not enduring 
a new and barbarous yoke ; these were scattered 
abroad over Crete and the Morea and Corfu 
and Venice ; for the two islands were theh under 
Venetian rulei But hardly fifty years had passed 
when the taxes imposed on the rayah were in- 
creased, and the Pashas one after another in their 
insatiable avarice trampled down the people, 
and the aghas who had already come from Con- 
stantinople to make money, and others who 



30 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

followed them, were a burden on the inhabitants. 
The island was suffering from repeated droughts, 
and the ravages of locusts, the peasants began 
" to emigrate, and the country was gradually 
becoming a desert. Often enough the rayahs 
laid their griefs before the Porte^ declaring 
that it was impossible for the island to bear the 
cost of a Pasha and his train : and especially 
through a great dearth in 1640, and in the follow- 
ing year a terrible plague, the island was wasted 
and ruined. The Forte gave heed at last to the 
manifest sufferings, ,^pf the people, and sent a 
tnuvela or exaipijier ,who sought out and wrote 
down name by name every rayah in Cyprus, and 
found (they say) hardly 25,000, including old men 
and children of twelve and fourteen. From that 
date the Porte removed the two Pashas of Paphos 
and Ammochostos, and left only the Pasha of 
three tails at Levkosia, though his train was 
somewhat curtailed of followers and servants. 
The taxes too were somewhat lightened, but the 

' remained as before : and the Porte pub- 
a firman, that Cypriots wherever they 
be were to return to their country, where 
would only have to pay the second year 
ar ten piastres each as taxes. 

ter the Porte had shown thus much interest 
island, Cypriots scattered here and there 
of it, and those who were free from family 
as returned to their country, hoping they 
find the exactions Ughtened, according 
imperial commands. Furthermore, about 
me time fortune-hunters from Constan- 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 31 

tmople were debarred from taking the aghaliqs 
on coming to Cyprus, and the Turkish zaims 
and sifahi who were left in the island began to 
hold the four local aghaliqs^ the Porte being really 
desirous to relieve the country of some of its 
many burdens. For many of the Turks settled 
in Cyprus were sufficiently rich and influential. 
They farmed their offices however from Con- 
stantinople, not from the Pasha for the time being. 
Nevertheless hardly twenty years passed, and the 
rayahs were fewer than more in number ; because 
the commands of the Porte were again neglected, 
and the insatiate Pashas exacted taxes as before, 
or even threefold more greedily. Drought, the 
incessant ravages of locusts, and the failure of 
commerce by reason of the wars waged by the 
Sultan with the Venetians in Crete and the 
Morea, and other troubles innumerable, reduced 
the Cypriots to such straits that many fled to 
the Syrian coast with their families. 

' We are led, although with no great certainty, 
to conclude that on account of the desolate state 
of the island in the year after the conquest of 
Crete, or even before this, the Porte reduced 
Cyprus from a pashaliq and placed it under the 
supervision of the Qapudan Pasha^^ by whom 
there was appointed from time to time as its 
chief a petty governor or musellim^ with a fixed 
salary of 12,000 pieces of Seville, or about 15,000 
piastres, which impost was called nuzul. For 
the collection of the kharaj there was sent from 
Constantinople a special collector, and it is said 

^ The Admiralissimo of the Turkish Navy. 



32 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

that he distributed among the rayahs 15,060 
notices of assessment. Another tax, called 
md'ishet, was claimed and paid every year to the 
Qapudan Pasha. This being the state of affairs, 
the local aghas, who had grown in importance 
through their wealth, their dignity, and protec- 
tion at the capital, set to work and obtained from 
the Qapudan Pasha the administration of- these 
revenues ; and whether under orders from Con- 
stantinople they farmed them, or collected them 
as agents, it was they who appeared then to be 
the masters and rulers of the island. It is easy 
to understand this from a narrative of the revolt 
of the famous Mehmed Agha Boyaji-Oghlu, 
which appears to have happened about 1680. 
This narrative I get directly from that worthy 
gentleman Monsieur Benoit Astier, Consul of 
France, who has, up to this present year 1788, 
presided in a highly becoming manner over the 
honourable guild of French merchants in Cyprus, 
and has always in his dealings both with governors 
'•"'^. governed shown Hndly feeling and given 
[ul help : in whose honour I set down his 
ement in his own words : 
" I learnt something from popular tradition, 
I also obtained excellent information from 
lips of an aged Turk of 97, and from a Greek 
.ost as old, who had both been eye-witnesses 
1 rebellion which occurred in this island about 
ity years ago, and lasted seven whole years, 
arus was then, like Rhodes and the islands of 
Archipelago, under the rule of the Qapudan 
ha. The yearly kharaj due to the Porte was 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 35 

collected by a kharaji ; the maHshet was collected 
on behalf of the Qapudan Pasha ; and the nuzul 
was assigned for the maintenance of the governor 
sent by that officer. It was fixed at 12,000 
pieces of Seville (Spanish dollars), then worth 
fifty paras each. 

* " The aghas of Levkosia who farmed these 
imposts, sometimes one sometimes another of 
them, fell to rivalry and quarrelling ; then they 
took up arms and attacked one another, until 
Mehmed Boyaji-Oghlu got the mastery over 
them all, was proclaimed leader, and stood out 
as a rebel for seven years. He paid every year 
to the kharaji sent by the Porte the appointed 
kharaji which these collectors had hitherto to 
beg for, and used to keep for their own ends. 
He appointed in aU the qaziliqs men devoted 
to himself, who were the administrators. The 
Porte, learning that this Boyaji-Oghlu had thrown 
off all pretence of subjection, sent to Cyprus 
Cholaq Mehmed Pasha with a force to restore 
order. They received him at Levkosia, but after 
a few months' space, when he tried to assert 
his authority over the said Boyaji-Oghlu, the 
rebel compelled him to leave Levkosia, and to 
retire to the chiftliq of Qubat-Oghlu, where he 
lived as a neat-herd, every care being taken to 
prevent news of his present condition reaching 
the ministry. Yet not long after news did reach 
them, and forthwith Chifut-Oghlu Ahmed Pasha 
was ordered to cross from Caramania to Cyprus, 
wth an armed force to release Cholaq Mehmed 
Pasha, and to wipe out the rebel chief. 

3 



34 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 



t n 




Ahmed Pasha crossed accordingly, landed 
at Acanthou, and marched straight to Kythraia, 
to seize at once on the mills, so that no corn 
might be ground, and he could stop the supplies 
of Levkosia, the rebels' stronghold. There he 
stayed for two months, and Cholaq Mehmed 
came to meet him. During this time he sent 
troops to the gate of the capital, where they 
engaged and skirmished with those of the. enemy ; 
not with any idea of disabling thereby the rebel 
host, but to prevent the ingress and egress of any 
kind of supplies or merchandise. 

* " The city then found itself without bread, 
and the Pasha, knowing that he had help at hand, 
though no one dared to declare himself on account 
of the rebel, proposed to Boyaji-Oghlu to allow 
him to withdraw, sending him a passport as a 
safe- conduct. The rebel, seeing that the Pasha 
had the stronger party with the city, left it by 
night with one company of trusty guards, and 
marched first to Levkara, and then to Levka, 
where the Kiaya ^ of the Pasha surprised him, 
killed twenty- eight of his men, and took thirty- 
two others prisoners. From Levka he went to 
Kykkos, and so far strengthened himself that he 
was able to repel the Kiaya, who had followed 
him up. From Kykkos he went to Paphos, 

^ The original meaning of Kiaya (literally transliterated 
Kietkhudd) is steward, or one who farms the lands of another. 
As an official title, as here, it means Deputy or Assistant. In 
modern times the kiaya, or kiahaya, is the official employed 
by Turkish Government Departments as their representative 
at the Central Office of the Government to follow up their 
letters, and see that they do not get overlooked or pigeon-holed. 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 35 

and thence to Kyrenia, where he caught one of 
the Pasha's famous spies, and hanged him on 
a tree opposite the fort. Pursued on all sides by 
the Pasha's troops, he made for Ammochostos in 
all secrecy, hoping to fortify himself there, but 
before he arrived they had shut the gates, and 
the Pasha's force routed the few soldiers left to 
him. He fled with six men only to Pyla, then 
to Larnaca, intending to go to Lemesos, but he 
was caught in the qaziliq of Koilanion and carried 
to Levkosia, where the Pasha hanged him by 
night, and on the morrow he was exposed with 
his followers, who were hung up alive, on hooks 
through their chins. And thus, after a lapse of 
seven years, ended this rebellion. All his followers 
and several rebel leaders were caught and put 
\o death. Many strange stories are told of them, 
especially in connection with beautiful women, 
and a certain Prankish family S.A. which spent 
large sums for the honour of receiving this 
Boyaji-Oghlu, and to keep out of his way one of 
the ladies of the house, whom he tried by every 
kind of influence to subject to his lust." 

* Now that this rebel and his followers were 
destroyed, the Porte appears from this date to 
have constituted the island a government under 
the Vazir, taking away the administration thereof 
from the Qapudan Pasha^ and a governor or 
muhassil was now sent by the Vazir for the time 
being. He was allowed the fvdlest executive 
and administrative authority, and was entrusted 
not only with the government of the inhabitants, 
but with the usual boghcha, or demand-forms of 



36 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

imperial taxes, and with the qaftans of the four 
local' aghaliqs. He was therefore governor, and 
collector of the imperial taxes, of the nuzul 
and maHshety and administrator of the four 
aghaliqs. So that upon one and the same person 
devolved the civil government, the military 
command, and the collection of all the imposts, 
whereas formerly one man administered the 
government, another exacted the kharaj, and 
other officers were appointed from Constantinople 
to the military commands. And this is the new 
order which still obtains in Cyprus. Although 
we have not any certain evidence of the time 
when, and the reason why, the island became the 
Khass^ or special appanage of the Vazir, it will 
not be out of place to mention that in 1702, 
by reason of the revolution which dethroned 
Mustafa II and put Ahmed III in his place, 
the then Vazir, a prudent and experienced 
statesman, put down the rebellion, and received 
Cyprus as a gift from the new Sultan, as we 
learn from certain Italian sources : after which 
it remained in the hands of the Vazirs. Towards 
the end of the century, in 1692, a great plague 
desolated the island, sparing, we learn, hardly 
a third of its inhabitants. 

* About 1 71 2 the wretched Cypriots had 
scarcely begun to enjoy a little rest after the 
plague, and other unceasing troubles which 
harassed the island and still harass it, when a new 
tumult and turmoil broke forth. Certain rascals 
from the Turkish fleet (Levendler or Qalionjiler) , 
about twenty in number, landed at Levka, 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 37 

entered Levkosia armed, and lodged together 
in a khan or inn. There, in conversation with 
others of their kind, they disclosed that news had 
reached the Porte of the inhuman tyranny exer- 
cised indiscriminately by the then muhassil^ 
and of the intolerable burden of taxes which he 
exacted from the rayah ; and after waiting con- 
firmation the Porte had sent them with firmans 
to depose him from his office, and further to 
sentence him, and the aghas who abetted him, 
to death : and they went on to brag that they 
had instructions to put things on a better footing 
to the rest and relief of all. These and the like 
stories they spread about among the lower classes, 
so as to gain these to their side. When night 
came they broke into the houses of the aghas first, 
caught them and bound them on the spot, and 
hurried them off as prisoners to their khan, 
threatening that they would slaughter them as 
the chief causes of the evils ; their aim being in 
securing the aghas to draw into their net many 
others, and finally to proceed to capture the 
muhassil himself. But their villainous craft was 
soon exposed, for some who pretended to be 
their friends, staggered by their extraordinary 
daring or perhaps won over by the aghas who 
were in custody, outwitted these knavish sailors, 
and learned that their whole story was false, and 
that they had no other aim, but to snatch large 
sums of money, and to be off. When the aghas 
learned the game they made every kind of promise 
that if they would release them, and let them go 
quietly to their houses before their capture was 



38 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

known in the city, they bound themselves by 
oath to pay them all the money they wanted. 
Their promises deceived the rascals, and they 
were released, and in concert with the muhassil 
laid their plans for the arrest and destruction 
of these high-handed impostors. Accordingly 
on the morrow the muhassil and aghas sent to 
invite the chief of the sailors to come and take 
the sums promised by the aghas ; adding that he 
would be received with fitting respect, and that 
the muhassil would arrange with him in what 
way he and his friends might mediate with the 
Porte, and secure the forgiveness of the local 
officials, as though it was hoped that their inter- 
cession and testimony would convince the Porte 
that the island was . quite well governed. The 
wretches were deceived, and sent their leader 
with two others of the band to the Serai. The 
Governor straightway put them under arrest, 
and sent to the others to come and assist at their 
council. These remained in the khan, and the 
delay in their companions' return exciting their 
suspicions, they began to fly, but they were at 
— ce caught by the Janissaries, and paid the 
[lalty of their wicked daring. Some of them 
; courts sentenced to be hanged, some the 
)vernor impaled, and those who were already 
his hands he strangled, and thus himself, the 
las, many other notables, and the city generally 
re delivered from the wiles of this band of 
screants, . ' . . 

' It was, I say, further permitted by Heaven 
Jt this unhappy island should suffer another 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 39 

unexpected blow, and encounter the most terrible 
danger ; while the rumour of such great and com- 
plicated troubles terrified the inhabitants in- 
discriminately from the least to the greatest, 
as in the days of the conquest. Death had been 
rife, emigration frequent, men were driven from 
their homes by the exactions, and the harvest 
was small. All these causes had reduced the 
number of the rayahs liable to the payment of the 
twenty-one and a half piastres to hardly 7,500, 
without counting 1,500 cripples, blind people, 
old people, paupers, and children of eleven years 
and under. The 10,066 warrants were exacted 
inexorably, while the extra payments extorted 
by the muhassils on behalf of the Vazir increased 
year by year. The inevitable expenses of the 
Palace and the administration were covered by 
the extortion from the richer families of forty 
or fifty piastres : the middle classes were squeezed 
to give thirty, and children, old and sick persons, 
ten, fifteen and even twenty. The harvests were 
scanty, commerce insignificant, distress evident 
everywhere. Twice and thrice the bishops re- 
newed their complaints to the Porte. But, alas ! 
they were not heard. The Porte was troubled 
with wars and rumours of wars, and could lend 
no ear to the wails of the Cypriots, or of many 
others of its subject states which were equally 
loud in lamentation. 

' At last in 1 764 came that rock of offence, 
that cause of all our ills, the Muhassil Chil Osman 
Agha, over head and ears in debt, by reason of 
the huge sums either exacted from him, or offered 



40 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

by him to the Porte, to obtain the Governorship 
of Cyprus. The wretch hoped to regain what 
he had paid, and fantastic wealth besides. But his 
evil fate exposed him to the wrath and indignation 
of the people, so that he was assassinated with 
eighteen of his choqadars. The fact that the 
imperial tribute was ready for dispatch to Con- 
stantinople, the pillage and robbery committed 
by the mob, and the assassination itself brought 
the whole population, great and small, Turks and 
Christians, into imminent <ianger of the Sultan's 
wrath, had it not been that God was pleased to 
inspire feelings of pity into the heart of the 
sovereign. 

' When Chil Osman had read the firman con- 
ferring on him the post of Governor, he allowed 
a few days to pass after the ceremonial visits, 
and then, through the Dragoman, Haji Joseph, 
proposed to the Archbishop and the rest, that, 
as his office was burdened with a debt of many 
purses, he had calculated that unless he received 
from every rayah whose name was entered on 
the demand warrants forty-seven piastres, he 
should not be able to meet his engagements. The 
prelates were astounded, and replied that as 
they had fared with his predecessors, so they 
hoped to fare with him, but to collect such a sum 
from the rayahs, thinned as their numbers were 
emigration, was altogether im- 
talked to him and implored him, 
d inflexible, and began to threaten 
would harry the monasteries and 
tions from them, and inflict fines 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 41 

upon the bishops for their obstinacy. They 
were confused, and finding that their entreaties 
had no success they sent messengers secretly 
to Constantinople with petitions to the Porte, 
imploring mercy, and setting forth the implac- 
able rapacity of the muhasstl. The messengers, 
though after some delay, obtained through the 
Silihdar Agha speech of the Vazir, and carried 
away a strongly worded firman, commanding 
the said Chil Osman not to exact more than the 
sum fixed by the imperial rescript, or he would 
be punished. Meanwhile, the messengers were 
long in returning, and the Governor never ceased 
to press for promises and signatures about the 
matter in hand, and for the circulation of such 
among the rayahs. Paisios then took counsel 
with his suffragans, and they arranged to escape 
by night. They started, but, because the Bishop 
of Cition did not keep the secret, they were caught 
the next morning at Liopetri, at a spot called 
the Rivefy by the Governor's men, and carried 
back to Nicosia, where Chil Osman ordered 
them to be guarded night and day in the Arch- 
bishop's house, fearing lest they should again 
escape, and accuse him to the Porte as a robber. 

' At last about the middle of October there 
appeared a Vazir Choqadar bearing the aforesaid 
imperial order. The Governor was sick with 
vexation, still October 25 was appointed for the 
reading of the document : not, however, publicly 
in full Divan, but in an apartment of the palace, 
in the presence of the Ulema, the aghas, the 
bishops, and a few Greeks and Turks, on the day 



42 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

when an ancient custom collects people from 
all parts of the island to the fair of S. Demetrios, 
held outside Nicosia. Here the villagers buy and 
sell what they want for their fields, and for their 
winter use, they make terms with their creditors, 
and transact various business. The persons above 
mentioned assembled accordingly to hear the 
order, which was read, when the Governor began 
in a reproachful tone to ask the Archbishop 
what harm he had done the rayah, that the 
Archbishop should accuse him to the Porte. 
Paisios replied, " God forbid, we came with tears 
to implore mercy on the poor rayah, but we never 
accused you." He had hardly spoken these 
words, when the floor on the side on which we 
Greeks stood, for I was among them, suddenly 
and utterly collapsed, and we were hurled into 
a black gulf, bishops and attendants, Greeks and 
Turks, with other victims, and the beams of 
the roof heaped on top of us. With no small 
damage and risk of our lives we freed ourselves, 
and were dragged out covered with dust and dirt, 
scarred all over, a sorry sight ! We were carried 
to our houses, one with an injured back, another 
with a broken leg : some had internal injuries, 
some were so terrified that they thought death 
imminent. The meeting was broken up, those 
present fled in alarm, and the people outside, 
hearing what had happened and the tumult 
within, believing it to have been a trap prepared 
beforehand to kill the bishops, rushed madly to 
the palace, carrying bludgeons and arms. They 
found the doors shut, they set them on fire, the 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 43 

palace was wrapped in flame, and the mob pouring 
in slew the wretched Chil Osman, with eighteen 
of his followers. They sacked and robbed the 
palace of all they could find, whether it belonged 
to government, to the murdered Governor or 
his train — a terrible tragedy. The news spread 
and all were dumb as corpses, Ulema, aghas and 
rayahs, all crouching in mute terror, expecting 
only that the sword of authority would fall on 
all alike, and that inexorable vengeance and 
savage requital would be exacted for the blood 
thus savagely shed. 

* Three or four hours, passed before there was 
any lull in the shouting in the streets, in the rush 
and roar of men running'to the sack of the burning 
palace. The bazars were shut, and all the re- 
spectable people shut up in their houses, suflPering 
paroxysms of terror. They believed that the 
city was wholly given over to revolt, murder and 
pillage, and the Turkish magnates, though sadly 
distressed, took prudent measures to disperse 
the mob, lest the rioting should increase, and be 
directed against the houses of the wealthy and 
prominent citizens. The Molla, by the dellal 
or crier, straightway commanded the villagers, 
Turks and Christians, in the name of the Sultan, 
to disperse and depart each to his village. They 
obeyed and left Nicosia forthwith. Orders were 
given for the burial of the musellim and the other 
victims ; the fire in the palace was extinguished, 
and guards were set to watch the city within 
and without, and carefully to search every one 
who entered the gates for concealed arms. 



44 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

* When night came the Ulema and aghas met 
in the Molla's house to consult about appointing 
a temporary administrator, and to contrive 
the most prudent method, and most specious 
pretexts, with which to announce the daring 
action of the mob to the government. How 
should they devise any reasonable justification 
and excuse, so that the Porte should not think 
that the island generally had risen in revolt ? 
The murder of the sovereign's representative, 
the pillage of the treasury and robbery of the 
imperial funds, the burning of the Serai, or 
official palace — here were three indefensible 
crimes, which would require tact and wisdom, 
and common feeling and action of both Turks 
and Greeks, to make them appear natural results 
of the tyrannical harshness of the murdered 
musellim^ which had been such as inevitably to 
drive the people to the fury and daring which 
they had displayed. So they debated, and found 
some specious excuses, representing the Governor 
as a tyrant, and something like a traitor, and so 
concocted their report to the Vazir. I omit 
the details as unimportant. Meanwhile the 
Turks in their mosques, the Christians in their 
churches, offered unceasing prayers and supplica- 
tions, that God would be pleased to inspire the 
Sultan's heart with pity, and that the lives of the 
Cypriots might be spared. At last the news 
reached the Vazir, and he, too, softened down 
the affair as well as he could to Sultan Mustafa III, 
and after no long delay Hafuz efendi came as 
muhassil, to complete the term of the deceased 



###TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 45 

Chil Osman, and later a muvela and qapiji-bahis 
to ascertain if what the magnates had written 
was true, to examine minutely into the causes 
of the slaughter, to exact the repayment of the 
sums stolen from the palace, and blood- money for 
the musellim and his followers. 

* The commissioners made their inquiry, and 
the kindly souls were won by gifts to declare 
the deceased the cause of the outbreak, and to 
justify the offenders. The relations of the 
murdered men presented themselves, and each 
received the price of blood. The leading men 
among the rayahs promised to be responsible for 
the imperial taxes to the last para^ the parts of 
the Serai which had been burnt were restored, 
and excommunications were hurled by the Greek 
clergy against those who had stolen things from 
the palace, if they did not restore them to their 
bishop, or parish priest, or to their church, or 
to certain mosques specially named, which they 
might do without fear : but very few people 
appeared, and very few things, and those of little 
value, were surrendered. The Molla and his 
party threatened the robbers with the vengeance 
of Mohammed, but all in vain. But the thieves 
who had taken the treasure guarded it well ; 
the Christians devoted their souls to the fellow- 
ship of Judas, the Turks to the wrath of their 
Prophet : they would provide first for their 
bodies, and then take thought for their souls, 
though hereafter they should suffer the vengeance 
of eternal fire. 

* We succeeded, thank God, in satisfying the 



###46 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

muvela and the qapiji, and the Molla, who was our 
advocate : we escorted them out of the city, and 
dispatched them to sing our praises to the Porte. 
Hafuz efendi remained, and now let us see what 
he did, whom I call the second cause of the real 
rebellion. In honest truth we cannot accuse 
him of being a bad man : their circumstances 
very often expose men in authority to popular 
dislike. He had to pay for his investiture and 
other things in Constantinople. Arriving in 
Cyprus he found things topsy-turvy. The ex- 
penses incurred on behalf of the muvela and 
qapiji, payment for the property of the murdered 
men, the rebuilding of the palace, restitution of 
• the stolen treasure, and innumerable other pay- 
ments mounted up, it was said, to a thousand 
purses of aspers. The whole community, Turb 
and rayahs, gave leave and authority to Hafuz 
efendi as Governor to meet all the claims, a^nd 
arrange matters as he thought best. The ac- 
counts were completed and examined, and the 
aghas and bishops decreed that the sum total 
Duld be divided between the Greeks and Turks, 
le former were to pay two shares, and the 
irkish villagers one. In short, the Christians 
d to pay fourteen piastres a head, the Turks 
^en. Clerks and collectors were appointed, 
d the Christians began to pay. The Alay 
y, Mustafa Qubat-oghlu, who was charged 
th the collection of the Turkish quota, sent 
t men to the villages to get the cash. Whispers

Turks began to be uneasy and to grumble that 
the aghas were in league with the muhassil to 
fleece them ! " They were Turks, and they 
wouldn't pay," and in short raised such an opposi- 
tion that in the Mesaoria they drove away the 
collectors, and put them in fear for their lives. 
These strong measures alarmed some of the 
leading country Turks : they began to plot, and, 
to make a long story short, on Holy Tuesday 
of 1765, three hundred Turks of the Mesaoria 
and Ammochostos assembled at Kythraia, and 
seized the water-mills which ground flour for 
Nicosia, so as to cut off the supply from the 
capital, and to put the aghas and Governor into 
such a strait that they would desist from demand- 
ing the seven piastres. This daring act greatly 
alarmed the city- folk ; they determined to meet 
the assailants with force, and sipahi and yenicheri 
advanced fully armed to the outskirts of Kythraia. 
Finally matters were arranged between them, 
on the understanding that the Turks should not 
be troubled to pay their share, and so each party 
departed to their homes. Here 'the musellim 
and aghas were clearly wrong, in not determining 
to put down by force this petty rising, and in not 
taking such order as to check the insurgents, 
and prevent them from attempting, as they did 
later, a far greater and more desperate outbreak. 
* It was necessary, however, to collect the taxes, 
because those who had lent money demanded 
the repayment of their loans, and Hafuz was 
eager to send money to the Porte to show that 
the island and himself were loyal and ready : 



48 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

hence arose great talk and uneasiness among the 
people. The suspicion rooted in the minds of 
the insurgents that the Governor and aghas were 
certainly working for their, destruction made 
such a painful impression that the leaders of the 
revolt conspired to get into their hands one of 
the fortresses : possibly the fools thought that 
the clemency shown by the sovereign towards 
their first offences mere weakness or indifference.

Accordingly on July 27, the day of the fair at the 
monastery of S. Panteleemon, at Myrtou in the 
district of Kyrenia, to which crowds flocked 
from all parts of Cyprus for worship and business, 
many of the ringleaders attended, and found 
there a certain Khalil, disdar or commandant 
of the strong castle of Kyrenia, a vain silly
creature, whom they easily led astray, and made their 
leader, promising to secure his appointment as 
musellim of the island, because he would work 
for the relief of Turks and rayahs alike, and gain 
great credit both with the people and the Porte. 
They swore obedience to him on the spot, and 
the vain fool, eager for some kind of fame, set 
out for the fortress, and was soon followed by a 
crowd of rebel Turks. He made one his kiaya, 
another colonel of a regiment, and so on ;
distributing posts to those he thought capable, 
or who commended themselves to him, so as to 
set up a kind of government. He sent orders 
and threats to the villages, that if any one, Turk 
or Greek, refused to obey him he would burn 
and destroy their houses, their property, and 
themselves ; and in many villages these threats 
were really carried out. He demanded a subsidy 
from the villagers, and bade them take heed that 
no one complied with the orders of the citizens 
about the fourteen and the seven piastres. They 
were not to pay a para : the disobedient were 
warned they would lose their heads. It is said 
that he collected a force of about 5,000 armed 
men. He sent notices to Nicosia to demand the 
four aghas, who were the cause of all the trouble, 
and the four bishops, that he might obtain reports 
and petitions to be forwarded to the Porte begging 
that the Governorship should be conferred on 
himself, and much else that I must pass by. 

^ The daring of this Khalil disturbed the 
musellim and the citizens of Nicosia ; but it was 
now too late to check an insurrection which had 
spread so far. The traitor and rebel was in a, 
strong fortress : the Turks outside the city, 
either through force or choice were nearly all 
on his side, the inhabitants of Nicosia began to 
suffer from hunger, the villagers were growing 
lawless, and the bishops, seeing no longer any way 
to escape the vengeance of the Porte, began 
to devise ways of leaving the island. The Arch- 
bishop Paisios, probably by the Governor's 
advice, left the city secretly, and after wandering 
in disguise over half the island, hiding in place 
after place from the rebels, escaped at last from 
the coast of Paphos on August 18, with Chry- 
santhos. Bishop of Paphos, and another Chry- 
santhos, Bishop of Kyrenia, and got to Asia 
Minor, and thence to Constantinople. Khalil 
advanced as far as the village of Dicomo with 



50 TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 

cannons and a large force, and threatened to 

destroy Levkosia if the aghas were not surrendered 

to him. The cowardly citizens took fright, 

closed the gates and sat huddled up in the citadel : 

again some kind of agreement was made, and 

the rebel retired to Kyrenia. But when he 

found the citizens were trifling with him, in 

January he marched to Levkosia, posted himself 

with his forces and artillery on the heights of 

Hagia Paraskeva, and began to throw shots into 

the city, whose guns replied. He invested the 

town, so that no one could enter or leave it. We 

suffered pretty sharply from hunger ; flour failed, 

we ate broad beans and haricot beans, pulse and 

vegetables for nearly fifty days. What little flour 

we could get we had ground in hand-mills. 

. ' It was some time since the Porte had received 

news of the revolt, but either the government 

was dissembling, or believed that the natives could 

put it down. When, however, their information 

was confirmed by the bishops, a certain Ibrahim 

Bey, with two caravels, was ordered to start 

at once for Cyprus. To rid himself of the bishops

;et man, to inquire into the doings of Hafuz

hen instructed the bishops to embark on 

essel by which Suleiman efendi was sending 

ousehold and effects to Cyprus, while the 

Governor travelled by land. Ibrahim Bey 

d at Lemessos, found the revolt " growing 

serious, and by playing the fox managed 



to smooth things down. The bishops reached 
Larnax in February 1766, learned that Khalil 
had invested the capital and was bombarding it, 
and remained on board until {{wi:Ibrahim_Bey}} had 
deceived him, by writing that he brought KhaliPs 
appointment as Governor ; the rebel then raised 
the siege of Levkosia and withdrew to Kyrenia. 

The bishops sent him bakhshish from Larnaca, 
with assurances that they had praised his conduct 
to the Porte, in that he had prevented Hafuz 
from exacting money unlawfully, and that Sulei- 
man ef endi was coming to inquire into the whole 
matter. He was fool enough to believe them, 
and sent his khanjar as a token of their personal 
safety, to show, in fact, that they might safely 
return to Nicosia. A few days later Suleiman 
efendi arrived at Kyrenia. He told Khalil that 
he was come to enquire why, and with whose 
leave Hafuz demanded so much from the Turks 
and rayahs : he made the rebel a present of a 
furred coat, addressed him as his dear son, and 
hinted that he brought his commission as Gover- 
nor. Having done so much to mislead the 
insurgents, he continued his journey and arrived 
in Nicosia the week before Quinquagesima. 

There, after conferring with Ibrahim Bey 
and the natives, he decided that it would be 
difficult to put down the rising, and wrote at 
once to the Porte. Orders were sent then to 
Kior Ahmed, a Pasha of two tails, to Kior 
Keloghlu of Caramania, and to the Alay Bey of 
Attalia, Ja'fer Bey, to transport to Cyprus a 

^ Adalia. 

sufficient force to reduce the rebel Khalil and 
his following. Before the news of their coming 
reached Khalil or the people generally Hafuz 
efendi's term had come to an end, and Suleiman 
efendi was proclaimed Governor. The rebel, 
seeing now he had been deceived by his "dear 
father," marched against him and on June i 
again encamped at Mandia, full of wrath, and 
determined utterly to destroy the capital, and 
slaughter its inhabitants, his "father" and all, 
in revenge for the trick. Suleiman began to 
tremble before his son Khalil, ordered the gates 
to be shut, and a watch of Turks and Greeks to 
be set round the citadel. Then, affecting to 
believe that the bishops were the cause of the 
trouble which was endangering his life, he ordered 
them to sleep in the Serai, and to remain there 
until they saw what would happen, and the 
order was obeyed. Khalil fired into the city 
day and night, and the citizens replied, but no 
sally was made. 

Ten or twelve days at the most elapsed before 
the Pasha and his companions arrived, with a force 
of two thousand men. Khalil immediately raised 
the siege, and returned to his castle, where he 
fortified himself and a large following. The 
Pasha reached Nicosia, and marched on to 
Kyrenia with Kior Keloghlu and the Bey of 
Attalia. Ja'fer Bey and Ibrahim Bey came by 
sea, and surrounded the castle with their galleys. 
Hemmed in on every side, the silly rebel held out 
for forty days with his handful of adherents ; 
pressed at last by famine, they were obliged to 
surrender. Khalil's head was cut off, and sent
to Constantinople* The exploit won for Ahmed 
Pasha his third tail. Emir Ahmed, Khalil's 
Kiaya, who was the first to stir up trouble, was 
impaled. Other two hundred or more of the 
insurgents were hanged or impaled, and the 
country was relieved of the presence of a herd of 
miscreants.* . . . 

* Peace was concluded between the Turks and 
Russians immediately after the accession of the 
new Sultan Abdul Hamid, January 21, 1774. 
About July the island began to recover itself a 
little, although in addition to the old taxes 
four hundred new warrants were added to the 
kharaj assessment. The inhabitants, however, 
great and small, hoped for rest and peace, or at 
least to be exempt from fresh charges. It was 
some time since a wood-cutter of the deserted 
village of Clavdia, a one-eyed creature called 
Baqi, threw up wood-cutting, and joined the 
levendler or volunteers. He wrought a great 
deal of harm among the respectable villagers, 
and getting into the graces of an odaliq,
the slave-mistress of some notable, became musellim at 
Attalia. Hounded thence for his villainy, he 
returned to Cyprus and began to play the tyrant 
and robber at Larnaca. Here he was made 
zabit (magistrate), but being dismissed for his 
tyranny by the dragoman Christophaki, the blood-

the part played by the English Consul, Timothy Turner, cf,

sucker set upon the latter and murdered him on 
Easter morning, 1750. 

Under Suleiman efendi, 
Governor in 1767, on account of his ineffable 
tricks and wiles, treacheries and persecutions, 
he was thrown into prison, banished, deserted, 
and left so poor that he would fain beg his bread 
in the streets. But the unhappy country which 
Providence allowed him to call his own was yet 
to suffer fresh tumult, the sad result of his crimes. 

Reviled and despised as a common plague, and 
unlettered as he was, Ismail Agha, muhassil in 
1771, made him defterdar : it may have been 
from kindly feeling to Baqi, but more certainly 
because the aghas obstinately refused to pay 
the five hundred piastres he asked to allow theni 
to appoint whom they would. The agitator 
takes up his office, and begins to spread slanders 
and confusion : he gets rid of Haji Joseph, who 
was almost a sovereign among the Greeks, and 
whose office of dragoman had brought him dignity 
and riches, and. houses — the beam in the one eye 
of the High Treasurer. 

A new muhassil, Ali 
Agha, arrived. He knew the creature in 1760, 
when he was Kiaya in the house of his father-in- 
law Kasim, as shifty and hated by aghas and 
rayahs, and — but for the sins of the island — 
would have wiped him off the face of the earth. 
But Ali Agha fell ill, and the wily Baqi found 
means to evade the danger by persuading a doctor 
of his own kind to substitute poison for a purge. 
The muhassil died, and the Porte appointed 
his Kiaya to complete his term. He, too, un- 
fortunately fell sick, and the one-eyed monster 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 55 

again appears at his side with his potions ; begs, 
entreats and persuades the wretched Kiaya, who 
takes, drinks and drains the cup to the dregs, and 
forty days later he, too, is dispatched to his 
grave. 

Having succeeded so far, while the general 
suspicion was still thick upon him, the wretch, 
who was now Alay Bey, assembled the Ulema and 
aghas, and with infinite cunning and flattery 
persuaded them all, and the bishops as well, to 
write of him in favourable terms to the Porte, 
that he might be appointed to complete the 
unexpired term of Governorship.

Things turned 
out as he wished, so anxious was he to see himself 
Muhassil of Cyprus. At the end of the year one 
Hussein Agha came in his room, a silly drunken 
creature, under whom Baqi became again Alay 
Bev. The island's evil luck brought to its shores 
the Qapudan Pasha Hassan, who was on his way 
to chastise Tahir Omer, Governor of Acre, who 
in the recent war had proved himself a traitor, 
and the close friend of the Russians. 

The one-eyed Baqi tries all his tricks, cozens and cheats 
the empty-headed Hussein, the aghas and bishops, 
and goes down to Scala as representative of the 
whole population to greet the Qapudan Pasha, 
to whom he offers gifts and obeisances. 

After the usual compliments, with the utmost address 
he implores and intreats Hassan Pasha to accept 
him as his chiragh or protege, to assist him, 
and secure his appointment as the next Governor 
in Cyprus. He finds favour with the Pasha, 
obtains his promise," and in 1775, all unworthy

as he was, was appointed Muhassil, taking the 
style of Haji Abdu'l Baqi Agha. His wiles and 
rich gifts prevailed so far that he was maintained 
in office until 1783. 

' For the first year or two with consummate 

craft he feigned a kind of good nature, and made 

no attempt to resist the just demands of the 

bishops, and bore himself mildly as became a 

poor and friendless man. He inspired evil doers 

with fear, and it cannot be denied that he won the 

good opinion of the public, and that he did not 

try to load the rayah with new burdens. But 

still he was incurably greedy, not so much to 

make a fortune for himself, for he was liberal 

enough, but to satisfy the inhabitants of Levkosia 

and to make a name. He meddled in all kinds 

of business ; took from the rayah cotton, silk, 

wheat, barley on account of taxes at his own rates, 

sold at high prices, and insisted on making a kind 

of monopoly of produce of little value, so as to 

embarrass both the traders and the peasants and 

rouse their resentment. Thus enriched, and, 

"""re villager that he was, puffed up by his riches, 

began to build palaces and summer houses, 

store water outside the dty, to acquire teams 

3xen and farms and mills and gardens'in every 

ection, extorting them from the peasants, and 

ing little or nothing in proportion to their 

ae. At last he put a tax of eight piastres on 

rayah, regardless of his poverty. The bishops, 

)wing and regretting the misery of their flocks, 

isted and refused. In spite of them he sent 

officers out to collect the money by force and 



TURKISH RULE IN CYPRUS 57 

threats. The Turks as well as the rayahs were 
greatly disturbed, and they compelled the bishops 
to leave the island secretly in August 1783, 
and to go to Constantinople, to lay before the 
Porte their complaints, and report how greatly 
disturbed the island was on account of his 
tyrannical exactions. 

* The unexpected news of the bishops' flight 
excited Baqi's wrath, and he wrote overland at 
once abusing them to the Porte. The Porte 
made no further inquiry, but issued an order of 
banishment, that wherever caught they were 
to be exiled to Mount Athos. 

With threats and 
pressure he harried and worried the clergy and 
laity of Levkosia, who chose four monks in the 
room of the absent bishops. Baqi wrote and 
obtained their berats^ and squeezed from them 
as many purses as he would. With these powerful 
agents he persuaded the Vazir to order the 
Patriarch to write to his brother of Antioch to 
consecrate them. But he failed to gain his point, 
and the bishops elect were not consecrated, much 
as they might wish to infringe the canons, and 
take possession of their sees. 

At Chios the unhappy bishops heard of their banishment, and
of the search made for them by the Porte. They 
hid themselves in Smyrna : the Archbishop found 
a refuge in the house of the Dutch Consul and 
his wife, Madame Baroni, a lady noted for her 
freedom of speech towards the Turkish officials 
both in Constantinople and Smyrna, as well 
as for her great generosity and good heart. And 
the other prelates were housed with various 
pious persons, until the anger of the Porte passed. 

Shortly after Meletios, Bishop of Cition, was 
sent secretly to the capital, and using the measures 
which were generally convincing there obtained 
the itlaq or release of his colleagues. 

By imperial 
command the Archbishop Chrysanthos, Soph- 
ronios, Bishop of Kyrenia, and Panaretos, of 
Paphos, went to Constantinople, and in an 
audience of the Vazir exposed the tyranny and 
extortion of the one-eyed Baqi, and his persecu- 
tion of rayahs and Turks. 

The Porte was satisfied, 
and ordered him with threats to come in hot 
haste to the capital, to justify himself. He 
heard the commands and threats, and could not 
but obey, so, terrified and trembling for his life, 
much against his will the wretch sailed for Constantinople. 

Without waiting for his arrival the Porte 
nominated another muhassil, and the bishops 
were ordered to sail with him for Cyprus. The 
Bishop of Paphos started first and reached his 
country. The Archbishop embarked on another 
vessel, and was wrecked off Gallipoli. But by 
the divine mercy he escaped, and arrived unhurt 
at Levkosia. The Bishops of Cition and Kyrenia 
remained behind to await the arrival of Haji 
Baqi, and to be present if necessary at his trial. 

At last the coward Haji Abdu'l Baqi arrived, 
presented himself before the Vazir, was examined 
and found guilty of the charges laid against him. 
He was condemned, and stripped of his wealth 
and authority, and the crow remained the crow 
he was before, just escaping with his life.

The bishops reached Cyprus loaded with a debt of
over 700 purses, and found their country had 
been for a year past scourged with want and 
dearth ; the crops had failed through the drought, 
the people were sunk in debt and misery, and 
hardly knew where to look for grain. Eyery one 
was 'famine-struck, and business unprofitable and 
uncertain. Above all, the people had an evil 
habit of not ascribing their misfortunes to the 
proper source, nor the increase of their debts 
to the insatiate and heartless greed of the Gover- 
nors, but thoughtlessly laid the blame on their 
spiritual fathers and chiefs ; and this not only 
now, but from of old. Ingratitude, alas ! is a 
very old heritage among Cypriots. Many refuse 
to lend a helping hand to those whose love had 
prompted them to risk their lives for their com- 
patriots. 

^ What then ? When things in Cyprus were 
reduced to this lamentable and miserable condi- 
tion, the wicked Baqi (the Vazir by whom he 
was condemned having fallen, and the seals 
of the Empire being entrusted in 1784 to another) 
began to plot against the Cypriots, and expecially 
the bishops : but his evil machinations turned 
against himself. He used all his influence, col- 
lected large sums of money, and again obtained 
his investiture as muhassil for the coming term. 
But quickly his joy vanished, like a shadow or a 
dream. The news of the scheme reached the 
island, and aghas, ulema and rayahs hurried off 
in troops to the Porte, denouncing him, trumpet- 
ing forth his tyranny, and declaring with deter-- 
mination that the population, to the very child- 
ren, would leave the country if they saw their 
implacable enemy and oppressor but set a foot in 
it. They insisted moreover that he only sought 
that post to get his revenge on his accusers. The 
Vazir was satisfied of the villainy of the one-eyed 
wretch, and of his aims, and forthwith, by the 
Sultan's command, issued a terrible decree that, 
under pain of death, he should never dare to land 
in Cyprus. He was stripped of his office, and 
banished to Jaffa, a desert spot : and there, 
Heaven lending ear to the groans of a whole 
people, he was soon struck by the plague, and spit 
out in tortures his miserable soul. His country- 
men preserved the memory of his crimes by raising 
piles of stones in the highways and crossways, 
to which each passer-by adds his stone and his 
curse. 

But as my history must find its end in the end 
of this present December, 1788, a year which 
has been disastrous throughout the Ottoman 
Empire, I think it well to note here the new 
distribution of the imposts to be levied from the 
rayahs, under the order of the reigning Sultan, 
dated 1785. 

^ At that time it pleased the Porte, for high 
and secret reasons of state, to put up for sale the 
imperial revenues of many provinces, including 
Cyprus, which was now separated from the 
emoluments of the Vazirs, who for more than 
a hundred years had dealt with the island as 
their own property. From information received 
from other quarters, but chiefly from Michael, 
son of the Archbishop Chrysanthos, an old 
gentleman still residing in Venice, the revenues 
of Cyprus were sold for 1,562,500 piastres, or. 
312,500 sequins. They were divided into 125 
lots, each priced at 12,500 piastres. From each 
of these lots the buyers, Turkish capitalists and 
officials, enjoy by imperial decree, by way of 
interest, 2,000 piastres. 

In a year's space this interest, collected from the 
Rayah only, amounts to 250,000 

The Christian population pays yearly besides . . 65,000 
The Governor, for his investiture (qaftanparasi) pays 
yearly to the Vazir 32,000 

Yearly assessment, not counting other dues paid by 
Turks and Greeks alike 347,000 

I judged it idle curiosity, and likely to rouse 
the suspicions of witless persons, to set forth 
in detail the state-revenue of the island collected 
from Moslem and Christians. Yet I possess a 
detailed and accurate account of the sums en- 
cashed in 1777 under the rule of Baqi. 

For 
the information both of the natives and the 
curious stranger, I may add this, that in spite 
of its scanty population the island pays yearly 
and inevitably to its masters more than it paid 
under the Venetians. 

Yet it is scourged by 
locusts, and often wasted by drought : it is 
deficient in the inhabitants, farmers, artisans and 
merchants, adequate to its extent, and necessary 
for the development of its soil. 

As regards its administration, call it as you 
will a government or a tyranny, if any one would 
compare the conduct of the former authorities, 
albeit Christians, with that of the rulers of to-day, 
conquerors and aliens in faith and race, he would 
find both equally oppressive to the people under 
them. 

Briefly, according to the census of 1777, in 
the miserable days of the monster Baqi, the 
families of Greeks, Armenians and Maronites, 
rayahs paying taxes, rich and poor together, 
were distributed (omitting Levkosia) in 564 
villages and towns, allotted to the various sub- 
districts and qaziliqs comprised in the four dis- 
tricts into which the island is divided, and subject 
finally to the one capital Levkosia. 

You will find below a general estimate of the 
Turks and Christians, of both sexes and all ages, 
now inhabiting Cyprus ; although I cannot say 
whether in the eleven years which have elapsed 
since the last census the population has increased 
or decreased. But there are those who think 
the estimate excessive, and it may be admitted 
to be approximative, rather -than ascertained 
with curious exactitude.

There are grave doubts about the number of 
Moslems, who, according to many European 
travellers of authority, are more than the Chris- 
tians. You will find it so stated in the work of 
Mr. John Hawkins, an Englishman and acquaint- 
ance of my own, a mineralogist, who went over 
the island two years ago, and noted all that was 
curious and interesting. His companion, also 
an Englishman, was a botanist, and wrote a full 
account of the herbs of the island used in 
medicine.' 

From the foregoing extracts and from other 
contemporary accounts we may summarize as 
follows the changes which the administration 
of Cyprus successively underwent. At the con- 
quest, the island was placed under the jurisdiction 
of a Pasha of three tails as Governor responsible 
to the Grand Vizier, with his residence in the 
capital, Nicosia. He was assisted by two Pashas 
of two tails, stationed respectively at Paphos and 
Famagusta. In or about 1641, as the result of 
famine and plague, it was found desirable to 
reduce the establishment, and, although the 
Pasha of three tails remained, his household 
was diminished and the Pashas of Paphos and 
Famagusta withdrawn. Later, the island, having 
suffered further impoverishment through drought, 
locusts, and war, was reduced from a Pashalik, 
and placed under the administration of the 
Qapitan Pasha, the Lord High Admiral of 
Turkey, who generally combined with his naval 
functions the Governorship of the Archipelago. 
This change, which took place in or about 1670, 
entailed the advantage that the Musellim," 
n of MuteseUim. 
 

the official delegated by the Qapitan Pasha to 
administer the island on his behalf, was paid a 
fixed salary, instead of being permitted to enrich 
himself as best he could at the expense of the tax- 
payers. The Qapitan Pasha's regime was, how- 
ever, short-lived; in 1702 (pace Kyprianos^) the 
island reverted to the Grand Vizier, but this 
time in the shape of a Khass, or personal fief. 
This meant that the Grand Viziers now regarded 
the island as a private investment rather than as 
a province of the Ottoman Empire ; henceforth 
they let the office of Governor to the highest 
bidder, and generally for a period of only one 
year, the ruffianly Haji Baqi Agha being one of 
the few whose term exceeded that period. 

* The income of the Governor is undefined, he 
can amass just as much as his conscience allows,' 
remarks de Vezin, adding with subtle humour : 

The bishops do their best to keep on good terms 
with him.' And Drummond comments as 
follows on the arrangement : ' The government 
is annual, so you may well imagine how the 
wretched people are fleeced. Muhassil Mustafa 
Bey, according to the best information I could 
obtain, has this last year extorted as much as 
will pay his rent, indemnify him for the presents 
he made, defray the expense of travelling and 
living, and put in his pocket 500 purses,* or 
^31,250, exclusive of innumerable things of 
value, with which his favour has been courted.' 
The Administrator of Cyprus was now generally

* A purse is reckoned at 500 piastres. 

known as the Muhassil,' and, unlike his pre- 
decessors, combined with his executive and 
administrative powers the supreme military and 
financial authority. The title Muhassil indicates, 
in fact, his new functions as collector of the re- 
venue ; that of Musellim, which he still retained 
in addition to the other, applying more properly 
to his administrative attributes. A catalogue 
of the Turkish oilicials in Nicosia at this period, 
which is given by Drummond,' is sufficiently 
interesting to be worth quoting : 

' The Officers civil and military, who reside 
in our capital of Nicosia, where the Muselim 
'keeps his Court, are : 

' The Mufti, supreme judge or Mohammadan 
Patriarch, by whose decision every difficulty or 
doubt in the law is removed or determined. 

' The Molla, who is judge ordinary, and sub- 
governor of the city. 

' The Naqibu'l Eshraf, who is chief of the race 
of Mohammad in the island : a clan who 
enjoy the honourable distinction of wearing 
green turbans. 

' The Muselim's court is composed of a Kiaya, 
who is his deputy, lieutenant, and private 
secretary. 

' Divan efendi, high chancellor and secretary 
of state. 

' Khaznadar, high treasurer. 

' Muhurdar, keeper of the seals.

* Vekil-Kliarj, master of the household. 
^ Qahveji, coffee maker. 

' Sherbetji, confectioner and sherbet maker. 

* Bukhurdanji, perfumer, and he who carries

* Alay Bey, general of the horse. 

* Zaim, captains, or rather officers of horse, for 

their degrees are such as cannot be dis-

who are paid from the tythes of the grain,

For a few years, from 1745 to 1748,^ Cyprus 
became once more an independent province 
subject to a Pasha of three tails, first under one 
'Abdu'llah, and from 1746 to 1748 under Abu 
Bekr Pasha, only to revert after this interlude 
to the Grand Vizier and his ephemeral Muhassils. 
But in 1785 the island, which seemed fated to be 
bandied about from one dignitary to another, 
passed for a second time from his hands into those 
of the Qapitan Pasha." We learn from Clarke, 
Kinneir, Turner, and Light," who visited Cyprus 
respectively in 1801, 1814, 1815, and 1818, that 
the Governors of their day were still the Qapitan 
Pasha's nominees ; and they continued to be 
until an end was put to this state of affairs by the 
reforms of Sultan Mahmud II.

}^lit thus : 

* Excerftay p. 288. 



On his arrival in this island, and his way to 
Nicosia, having noticed that there was no water 
in Larnaca, and that the poor people were obliged 
to bring it on their backs from a place two hours' 
distant from their town, he was touched thereat, 
and from that day forth he began to think of 
overcoming this difficulty. 

^ " Coming at last to Nicosia, and finding that 
the school situated in the courtyard of the mosque 
which is in front of the Palace was no longer 
maintained, for it was all but ruined, he straight- 
way repaired and put it in good order. Then 
he built eight shops on the same line of the 
mosque, four on the rigWt side of its great en- 
trance, three on the left, two others on the right 
side of its eastern small door and six on the left, 
which gives altogether a total of twenty-three 
shops. 

^ " After all this he began the execution of his 
first object by digging a great many wells in his 
garden Stavros, at the village of Arpera, and in 
that of Francis near the same place, and so direct- 
ing the water to Larnaca. On the course of 
this water in a field held by him called Colimbo, 
where was the first fountain of this water, he 
built a flour mill. This field was of thirty-seven 
donums' size, bounded on one side 'by the field 
of Seperoghlu, on the other by the public road, 
and the remaining two sides by Government land. 
On a field of twenty-four donums' size near the 
same place he planted mulberry trees, and on 
another of four donums' size vines and a great 
many fruit-bearing trees. Besides all this, he 
built another flour mill on the same course of the 
water, in front of the bridge which is near the 
monastery of Hagios Georgios in the district 
of Larnaca. 

*"Abu Bekr Pasha, in a religious Council which 
he held at Nicosia, transferred this property 
aforesaid in vaqf , in the presence of Ismail Efendi, 
the Defterdar, and a great many witnesses, whose 
names will be mentioned hereafter. He delivered 
all this to the said Ismail Efendi, whom he 
appointed trustee or administrator. 

* " Abu Bekr Pasha transferred all this in vaqf^ 
in the same manner as he had already dedicated 
his property in Constantinople, and that in other 
places : that is to say, enregistering them in the 
books, or appropriating them to the class of the 
Haremein Sherif ein * vaqfs^ under the following 
usual conditions : 

" That all this property should remain in his 
possession during his life. On his death the 
inheritance should descend to his sons, and after 
the extinction of the male progeny of the latter, 
to fall under the possession and control of the

perty to be equally divided by the administrators 
or trustees for the time being equally among the

and constructed by him in future are to be added

The conquest of 1571 introduced into Cyprus, 

the bulk of whose inhabitants had hitherto been, 

*^ as we have seen, Greek in religion and in language, 

I a large element of Ottoman Turks. The original 


Turkish settlers were principally drawn from Lala 
Mustafa's soldiers, who were given fiefs in the 
island by Sultan Selim ; but they were added 
to from time to time by Turkish immigration 
from Anatolia and Rumelia. 

The Turks thus 
became a permanent factor in the population of 
Cyprus, and, while refraining from intermarriage 
with their Orthodox compatriots, and while 
preserving the purity of their language to an extent 
equalled in few other regions where Turkish is 
spoken, maintained relations with the Greek 
Christians which, if not intimate, were on the 
whole quite amicable. 

The Turkish peasant 
of Cyprus was subject to the same trials and 
tribulations at the hands of the Government as 
was his Christian neighbour ; and when the 
power of the Archbishops was at its height, he 
felt the effects of their supremacy no less than 
the Orthodox peasant, with whom he was quite 
capable of combining against the common op- 
pressor, be he Turkish Pasha or Orthodox Arch- 
bishop. * * The latter \sc. the Turks],' remarks 
Turner, ^ have no greater privileges than the 
former [the Greek-Christians], at which they 
are constantly expressing great discontent.' 

The actual proportion of Turks to Greek- 
Christians during this period is exceedingly 
difficult to ascertain, owing to the diversity of 
the estimates given by contemporary authorities.
 
Those of Kyprianos and the Qanun-Name have 
already been quoted ; Drummond puts the Turks 
at 150,000, the Greek-Christians at 50,000. 

* cf. Handbook of Cyprus, pp. 38-40. 

De Vezin, writing toward the end of the 
eighteenth century, gives the figures as 60,000 
and 20,000; Kinneir, in 1814, as 35,000 each; 

Turner, in the following year, as  between 
60,000 and 70,000 souls, of whom about 40,000 
are Greeks.' On the other hand, Tricoupi, in 
his History of the Greek Revolution^ states that in 
1 821 Cyprus had 100,000 inhabitants, of whom 
20,000 were Turks ; an estimate far more in 
accord than the others with the proportion of 
Turks to the total population that has subsisted 
in modern times. The statements of the earlier 
writers have every appearance of being based 
on guesswork ; and we may conclude with com- 
parative safety that at no time were the Turks 
in Cyprus superior in number to the Christians. 

For about a century after the Turkish conquest, 
the Archbishop and Bishops of the Church of 
Cyprus remained politically in the background. 
They received, it is true, the Sultan's berat or 
Commission of investiture, without which they 
could not exercise their episcopal jurisdiction 
or enjoy the temporalities of their sees ; and 
they * never failed to meet the imperial officers 
on their arrival from Constantinople, with the 
clergy and people, to offer the usual bakhshish 
or gifts, whether customary or prescribed, to 
these Pashas, Governors or MoUas, and occasion- 
ally to pay them visits of ceremony.' ^ In other 
respects, however, they took' no part in the 
general administration of the island. 

But in about 1660, to return to Kyprianos, 
when plague and dearth had thinned the popu- 
lation, and many had emigrated to escape their 
debts, and the island was growing deserted, the 
Porte, wishing to curb in some degree the rapacity 
of the authorities, to save the rayah from perishing 
under their exactions and tyranny, and to inspire 
some little hope into the poor creatures still left, 
probably thought it politic to recognize the 
Archbishop of Cyprus for the time being, with 
his three suffragans, as guardians, in a way, 
and representatives of the rayah ; so that the 
rayah might gain courage from the hope that the 
bishops would be heard when they appealed to 
the Porte on his behalf, and those still in the island 
would remain, and those who had fled would 
return to their birthplace : while the rapacious 
officials, conscious of the influence the prelates 
exercised with the Porte, would be afraid to vex 
the people as heretofore. 

A proof of some such 
intention on the part of the Porte is that it re- 
ceives very graciously their arz or petition about 
taxes, and all complaints they may make if so 
be they be sent to it direct under their seals, the 
Archbishop's name being written in Turkish 
with red ink (his seal alone is found imprinted 
in the imperial qayd or register in red ink, while 
all the seals which accompany it, including those 
of the Patriarchs, are impressed in black ink), 
and those of his three suffragans in black. . . . 
' Thus encouraged the Archbishops of Cyprus 
often appeared boldly in person before the Grand 
Vazir, stating their complaints and asking for a 
diminution of the taxes paid by the rayah, and 
begging for help and support in other necessities.
Journeys of this kind on behalf of the common- 
wealth were made to Constantinople by Nice- 
phoros, the two James, Germanos, Silvestros, 
by Philotheos twice, by Paisios and his suffragans, 
and only a few years ago, in 1783, by the present 
worthy Archbishop Chrysanthos, with Panaretos, 
Bishop of Paphos, Meletios of Cition, and 
Sophronios of Kyrenia. And they were often 
listened to, and obtained assistance. 

But often, 
too, through the malevolence of the Cypriots, 
they suffered imprisonment and banishment in 
the cause of their country and their flocks.' 

The misfortunes of these holy men were not 
exclusively due, however, to * the malevolence of 
the Cypriots,' as Kyprianos, with commendable 
loyalty to his hierarchical superiors, would have 
us believe. 

What actually happened was that 
the Archbishop and Bishops, who had been 
allowed by the Porte to grow powerful in order 
to act as a check upon the local officials, soon 
entered into alliance with those very same officials 
for the purpose of enrichment at the expense of 
the luckless peasantry. 

Kyprianos is a painstaking 
and, on the whole, a conscientious historian ; 
and perhaps it is scarcely fair to blame him for 
not calling attention to the beam in the eye of 
the Cypriote hierarchy. But it cannot be denied 
that de Vezin throws quite a different light on the 
episode of Haji Baqi from that cast by the worthy 
Archimandrite. * Cyprus,' he says, ' is adminis- 
tered by a Musellim or Governor (Vice-Pasha) 
who is also Muhassil or Receiver-General of the 


Grand Signer's revenues, and lives at Nicosia, 
where aU the higher courts hold their sittings. 
Usually he would be changed every year, but Haji 
Baqi Agha, who was raised to this dignity by the 
influence of the Archbishop and his friends, 
held it several years, until in 1784 dissension arose 
between him and the bishops about the trafiic 
carried on by them and their relations to the 
detriment of his own. The archbishop and his 
suffragans travelled in all haste to Constantinople, 
there to seek help. The Governor was in fact 
recalled, but the whole affair cost the bishops 
so much money that up to this day, as they pre- 
tend, they have been unable to pay the debts 
they then incurred.' And when, in 1785, Cyprus 
passed out of the jurisdiction of the Grand Vizier, 
the unholy aUiance continued, for de Vezin goes 
on to describe how the Qapitan Pasha sent a new 
Musellim * to Cyprus from Rhodes, a man who 
never does the least thing except on the advice 
of the Archbishop, his three suffragans, and the 
dragoman of the Serai,' the latter * connected by 
marriage with the Archbishop.' ^ 

As the Dragoman of the Serai was a person of 
considerable importance in Cyprus in Turkish 
times, it may be well to insert here Mariti's 
description of his functions : 

The Dragoman of the Serai holds one of the 
principal posts assigned to a Christian. His 
title signifies " interpreter in the Governor's 
palace," but he is really the agent who treats 
between the Christian population and the 

* Excerpta, pp. 368-9. 

Governor. I was wrong in saying he held a 
firman from the Porte. He is nominated directly 
by the bishops, who are ready to change him if 
he is not acceptable to the government. He 
must be a man of sense and tact, for his position 
is a very important one. 

' The bishops agree to pay him four faras 
on each item of the poll tax or Kharaj, and he 
represents them in all dealings with the Governor 
— not in their spiritual capacity as bishops, but 
as the natural leaders of the people. As such 
they bind themselves to pay to the Muhassil, 
through the dragoman, a fixed poll tax, reckoned 
according to the population. Besides this, the 
inhabitants of their own free will pay fifty purses, 
or twenty-five thousand piastres, to anticipate 
and prevent the exactions which capriciously, 
without reason or form of law, but suggested 
simply by calumnious tyranny, might fall upon 
them. But the Governor may accept these 
terms or not, as he pleases. They are arranged 
between the Muhassil and the dragoman, and this 
point settled the former has no right to levy 
any further contributions, beyond the duty on 
f oodstujffs exported. But he gets twenty thousand 
piastres from any one invested with the rank of 
agha, and a thousand piastres from each bishop 
as the contribution of his calogeroi or monks. 
He exacts other dues upon produce, and taxes 
the people to reimburse his expenditure both 
public and personal. The bishops, through the 
dragoman, agree to these impositions, which 
make the post of Muhassil very lucrative : if 
the holder is not a person of the highest honesty 
his gains are immense. 

^ I do not know of any other country peopled 
by Greeks under Turkish rule where the bishops 
are the representatives of the people. When 
Cyprus was taken from the Venetians the Greek 
inhabitants found themselves without leaders of 
position, education or experience, their best men 
having fallen in defence of their country, and 
so were constrained to put forward their bishops.

Drummond, who, like de Vezin, had been 
English Consul in Cyprus, and, like him, may be 
regarded as wholly unbiassed, is equally plain- 
spoken as to the Cypriote hierarchy : 

^ These stipends (i.e. those of the Archbishop 
and Bishops) are very considerable in a country 
where living is so cheap, and so many fasts ob- 
served ; yet all the bishops have other expedients 
for making sums of money : they move from place 
to place as traders, without bestowing the least 
attention upon their charge ; and frequently the 
archbishop raises general contributions under 
the deceitful veil of employing them in pious 
uses, or paying some extraordinary avaniey or 
special assessment of the Turks. For example, 
in the year 1743, the archbishop for the time 
being with the countenance of the Musellim, 
who shared in the robbery, levied from the poor 
people no less than 40,000 piastres : but they 
complained so effectually to the Porte, corroborat- 
ing their complaints with bribery, that he was 
stripped of his archiepiscopal robes, dignity and

emoluments. Indeed, there is no difficulty in 
obtaining this kind of satisfaction, for nothing is 
more agreeable to those corrupt ministers than 
complaints, because both plaintiffs and defendants 
enforce their arguments with presents, which 
must be renewed every hearing : and if the 
plaintiff gains his point so far as to make an empty 
saddle, the whole profit accrues to these ministers, 
who not only sell the vacant place to the best 
bidder, but afterwards share in the plunder of 
the new purchaser.'^ 

^ When the Governor,' says Mariti, * wishes 
to impose some tax on the Greek raya^ or 
subjects, he does not address himself to the people 
directly, but to the interpreter and he to the 
Archbishop, who sends notice to the several 
dioceses to make the most convenient arrange- 
ments, to avoid annoyances or to lessen the de- 
mand. The poor subjects might very often be 
saved from oppression if their Archbishop were 
not from policy, and sometimes from personal 
interest, ready to lend himself to the exactions 
of the Muhassily so that they are often abandoned 
by the very person who ought to take their 
part. ' " 

The famous Spaniard Don Domingo Badia-y- 
Leyblich, who travelled and wrote under the 
name of Ali Bey el Abbassi,* and visited Cyprus 
in 1806, leaves us the following observations : 

* The Greeks pay their bishops tithe and first-

fruits, fees on dispensations and others, and large 
voluntary offerings. These princes of the Church
receive the imposts assessed on the community 
so as to pay to the Turkish government its annual 
claim, and to share with it a kind of monopoly. 
The government has never succeeded it learning 
how many Greeks there are in the island. They 
own to a total of thirty-two thousand souls :, 
but well-informed persons raise this number 
to a hundred thousand. Last year a commissioner 
was sent to make an exact enumeration of the 
Greek families, but he was " got at," loaded with 
gold, and went away — his task unfulfilled. This 
handling the taxes brings enormous gains to the 
spiritual heads of the people, who suffer in silence 
lest a worse evil befall them.' ' 

Kinneir confirms the conclusions of previous 
writers. 

* The Governor and Archbishop,' he observes, 
* deal more largely in corn than all the other 
people of the island put together ; they frequently 
seize upon the whole yearly produce, at their own 
valuation, and either export or retail it at an 
advanced price ; nay, it happened more than once 
during the war in Spain, that the whole of the 
corn was purchased in this manner by the mer- 
chants of Malta, and exported without leaving 
the lower orders a morsel of bread.'* 

And Turner, who had been attached to the 
staff of His Majesty's Ambassador to the Porte, 
writes that : 

* Cyprus, though nominally under the authority

of a Bey; appointed by the Qapudan Pasha, is in 
fact governed by the Greek Archbishop and his 
subordinate clergy. The effects of this are-seen 
everywhere throughout the island, for a Greek, 
as he seldom possesses power, becomes immediately 
intoxicated by it when given him, and from 
a contemptible sycophant is changed instan- 
taneously to a rapacious tyrant. Accordingly 
the peasants of Cyprus, both Mahometans and 
Greeks — not a single Jew is allowed to live in the 
island — are so insufferably plundered that their 
labour is barely capable of supporting their 
existence, and they yearly desert in great numbers 
to the coasts of Caramania and Syria. The least 
Kharaj they pay is of thirty piastres, and the 
greatest sixty-five ; that is, each whole family. 
Their utmost gains are from 400 to 500 piastres 
a year, and of this they pay annually to the govern- 
ment and to the Greek convents 250, but for the 
sum paid to the convents — by far the greater 
part — they are forced to give sixty-five paras

at the beginning of the nineteenth century there 
came the inevitable reaction. The incidents 
of this reaction, which shattered the political 
ascendancy of the Orthodox prelates and com- 
pletely altered the administration of the island, 
will be related below, in the chapter dealing with 
the Consular correspondence. 

###THE LEVANT COMPANY IN CYPRUS 
1626-1825 

'From 1511 to 1534,' says Theodore Bent in his 
Introduction to Early Voyages and Travels in 
the Levant, 'we hear of certain " tall ships 
belonging to London, Southampton, and Bristol, 
which made voyages to the East, trading with 
Sicily, Crete, Chios, and sometimes Cyprus, 
Tripoli, and Beyrout in Syria " ; but there 
appears to have been no systematic commerce 
carried on in English bottoms in those days, most 
of the trade between the Levant and England 
being conducted by the Venetians.' 

It was 
primarily in order to remedy this state of affairs, 
which was unfavourable to the growth of English 
trade with the eastern Mediterranean, that certain 
merchants of London were incorporated in 1581 
as the Turkey Company, receiving from Queen 
a patent extending for seven years. 
expiry in 1588 the patent was not 

n its original form, owing to a conflict 

ts between the Turkey Company and 

1893 ; bring No. Ixzrvii of the Halduyt Society's 



the Venice Company, which had been founded 
in 1583. In 1592, however, both Companies 
were amalgamated as the Levant Company, with 
a charter granted for twelve years. At the end 
of this period the Company received a permanent 
charter, which remained in force, with minor 
alterations, until surrendered to the Crown in 
1825. 

As we have seen, the 'earliest English archives 
preserved in Cyprus date only from the eighteenth 
century ; and our knowledge of the activities 
of the Levant Company in the island prior to 
that period is scanty in the extreme. For such 
information as we possess we are largely indebted 
to the researches* of Mr. G. Jeffery, F.S.A., 
late Curator of Ancient Monuments in Cyprus, 
among the Letter- Books of the Aleppo Consulate,
which were removed to the Public Record Office 
in 1910. And as the references to Cyprus in 
these books are stray and scattered, it is only in 
a fragmentary manner that we can reconstruct 
the history of the earliest English commercial 
settlements in the island. 

The Cyprus Vice-Consulate may be traced 
back to 1626, for the oldest of the Aleppo Letter- 
Books contains a reference, dated July 22, 1626, 
to * Petro Savioni, N*^ V. Consolo in Cipro.' * 
In 1631 we find in the Minutes of the Court of 
the Levant Company in London an allusion to 
trade with the island, in the shape of sailing orders 
for one of the Company's ships. ^ Leghorn was 

* Published in Notes and Queries of March 20 and 27," 191 5,

again the first place of call after London. The 
ship in question might stay there fifteen or twenty 
days, or indeed so many days as were needed to 
discharge and relade. From Leghorn she was 
to make for Zant, stay there three days, and then 
proceed to Scanderone,' where she might stay 
thirty days or more, according to the time she 
required for discharging. Thence she should 
make for Cyprus, where forty days were allowed 
her, in order that she might be able to take in 
her lading, half of which at most should consist 
of cotton wool and cotton yarn.'

In 1656 occurs 
the first regular appointment of a Consular 
officer in Cyprus. ' At the Court of Assistants 
of May 19, 1636, a letter was read from Mr. 
Glover, " who hath taken upon himself the con- 
sulship of Cyprus," asking for the Company's 
approbation. The Court approved, holding 
" that it was very necessary to have a consul in 
that place." At the General Court held June 2, 
Glover was appointed vice-consul, with 
Dnsulage of his place towards his mainten- 
and he was to be subordinate to the consul 
:ppo.' '

was fSted by all the resident Europeans in the 
island with sumptuous feastings, and on his 
arrival and departure was honoured with the 
customary salvos of artillery. At this period 
Cyprus appears to have been colonized chiefly 
by merchants of the French Levant Company.

Larnaca and found all the European merchants
there to be Frenchmen, but an Englishman came 
to settle during his stay. M. Baldassar Sovran, 
French Consul, was acting for the English nation. 
Mr. Deleau, whose tombstone remains at Larnaca,' 
was at this time just dead, and perhaps the newly 
arrived Englishman may have been Mr. Ion (or 
John) Ken, who must have died almost at the 
time of Van Bruyn's visit. 

' The two Kens, relatives of the famous Bishop 
Ken, the Nonjuror, were doubtless brothers. 
Ion Ken, buried at Larnaca in 1693, was the son 
of Ion Ken, elder brother of the Bishop, and 
brother-in-law of Isaac Walton.'

Consulate at Larnaca, and of its troubles with a 
company of merchants who had infringed the 
Levant Company's privileges. 

* The English Consul's house here is the best 
on the whole island, though the outside of it is 
only of clay, but nothing can be more neat or 
elegantly ornamented than the inside. It has also 
the largest hall I saw in any part of the Levant ; 
but, what is of much more importance, the English 
Consul is highly respected all over the island, as 
jointly with his company he advances money to 
the inhabitants, for getting in their several 
harvests, in which otherwise they wovJd be at 
a great loss. 

* In this both parties find their advantage, for 
the English do not advance their money under 
twenty per cent., and receive the interest in silk, 
wine, cotton, corn and other products of the 
country, on all which they set their own price; 
whence, without wronging those gentlemen, it 
may be supposed that thirty per cent, is the 
least they make of their money, and on failure 
of payment at the time appointed, they may 
immediately seize on the debtor's effects. The 
French are well aware of this lucrative manner 
of gaining the people's affections, and would be 
glad to supplant the English, but have not suffi- 
cient funds, most of them being only factors to 
merchants at Marseilles. 

* Besides this company of the English, and that 
of the consul, another particular English company 
not long ago settled at Larnica, where they built

a very stately and beautiful house. But the 
Governor, animated by the people, who were 
continually murmuring and complaining that 
the house looked more like a fort than a private 
house, and that they did not know what bad 
designs might be on foot, ordered it to be pulled 
down to the very ground ; which, as there was 
a manifest jealousy between the two houses, 
occasioned a surmise that the people had first 
been bribed by the Consul to make that uproar, 
and afterwards the Governor to comply with it. 
Each house, however, sent an agent to Con- 
stantinople, one to make its complaint, and 
another to justify itself ; but by the prudence 
of the English Ambassador they were recon- 
ciled/ ^ 

* One of the English merchants,' to return to 
Jeff ery, * of the early eighteenth century in Cyprus 
has left a few records behind him. A certain 
Mr. Treadway is referred to by several of the 
travellers of the period as a rich man who built 
the finest house in the Levant, at Larnaca, and 
many other houses on the road between Larnaca 
and Famagusta, eventually becoming a bankrupt 
in 1724. Mr. Treadway's house in Larnaca 
still exists, and is now the property of Mr. C. D. 
Cobham, a former Commissioner of Larnaca.' 
It possesses a very large room or hall, in which, it 
is said, a banquet was prepared for a large party 
of Mr. Treadway's friends and creditors in 1732, 
at the very hour when that gentleman was de-

camping from Cyprus in a Venetian ship. It 
is not recorded whether the guests much enjoyed 
the feast when they discovered the absence of 
the host under such circumstances. A letter in 
the Public Record Office referring to this matter 
is of interest in giving the names of a consul and 
merchants at Larnaca at that period :

private opinion in this matter. He says he would

years after so base an Action, this man having

' It will be noticed that the above documents 
appear to be the result of a commission of inquiry 
by a Mr. Purnell, acting as Consul in Cyprus. 
Presumably this Mr. " William " Purnell was a 
relation of the John Pm-nell who acted as Consul 
in Aleppo and Alexandretta between the years 
1717 and (about) 1750. Mr. George Barton 
had evidently retired for a time from the Consul- 
ship of Cyprus, although he did not die until

amongst the Aleppo papers relating to Cyprus,

a certificate appointing a " Cancellier " to the

Majesty the King, &c. in this Island and Kingdom

and Kingdom of Cyprus." 

* Seal of the British Chancery of Cyprus is 
attached. This Mr. W. B. Turner would pre- 

' sumably be the son or some relative of Mr. 
Timothy Turner, the Consul who seems to have 
died in 1768. . . . 

* We have lost the most wonderful opportunity 
of hearing a vivid account of the Levant mer- 
chants and their Consuls through the failure of 
Oliver Goldsmith to obtain the post of doctor 
to the Factory at Aleppo in 1761 ; his place was 
supplied by Dr. Russell.' 

A graphic description is given by Drummond 
of a visit paid by the English Consul and his 
party to the Pasha of Cyprus in the year 1745 : 

* Well then, our government is changed : and, 
in lieu of a mussalem, we are ruled by a pacha 
of three tails ; * that is, of the highest rank next 
to the grand vizier, but he is provided with the 
same officers, though in a greater number ; so 
that the country is now subject to a more powerful 
tyrant, and to him much greater honour is done 
than to a mussalem, to whom the consuls onlv 
send their annual presents ; whereas, this vice- 
regent exacts their personal attendance at Nicosia. 

* The Pasha in question was 'Abdu'Uah, the predecessor of 
Abu Bekr ; cf. Ch. I, p. 68. 


Accordingly, Mr. Consul Wakeman set out from 
hence on the sixth of May, to perform this 
expensive, mean ceremony ; which I think is 
unworthy of the crowns of Britain and of France. 
'The Neapolitan and Ragusan Consuls made 
no attempt to appear magnificent in their retinue 
and equipage, but the French and Venetians 
made strong efforts for that purpose, though they 
excelled us in nothing but number and confusion : 
our little troop marched with a genteel decency, 
and every thing was conducted in an elegant 
manner. The greatest part of the country, until 
we arrived at the river Peroi, which is about eight 
miles from Nicosia, is extremely barren ; we 
lodged very agreeably at a village called Margo, 
from whence we set out next morning, and went 
to a Greek convent, a little way from town. The 
pasha had sent his horses, very finely caparisoned 
a la Turquoise, to wait our coming ; a very 
extraordinary compliment : these we mounted, 
and our little cavalcade began to move in this 
order : First, the chawush qol-aghasi^ of the 
ojaq^ or corps, of the janisaries ; then the muzur 
of the ojaq, or corps, of the sifahi ; these officers 
may be understood as majors, adjutants, and 
sometimes as agents for the respective corps ; 
after them rode the consul's janisaries, the chan- 
cellor and first dragoman. Doctor Crutta, the 
first dragoman's son being a protege, the dragoman 
of the seraglio, the consul, with his choqadars 
on each side of his horse ; Mr. Boddington and 
your humble servant, together with Mi% Golightly, 
an English gentleman who was occasionally here,

and Mr. Gibson, who was followed by the servants 
in their diflFerent degrees. 

^ A little while after we halted at our lodgings, 
the consul sent to know if the Vazir pacha woidd 
please to give him audience : and the answer 
was, when it would be most convenient for the 
consul. We therefore set out for the palace, 
before dinner, in the order I have already de- 
scribed, and all of us dismounted at the gate, 
except the consul, who rode into the court of 
the seraglio, where ten or a dozen fine horses 
stood gorgeously caparisoned ; indeed their 
furniture " was incredibly extravagant. All the 
guards and officers of the palace were ranged in 
the court, stairs, passages, and apartments through 
which we passed to the presence-chamber, and 
all was silent and still. There we stood until 
the entrance of the pacha, who clapped the consul 
on the shoulder, as a mark of high favour and 
regard, desired him to sit, and several times bade 
him welcome : nobody sat but the pacha on his 
divan, and the consul on an elbow-chair of state : 
the pacha's not being in the room to receive him, 
and the consul's standing until the other entered, 
proceeds from this punctilio. A vazir, a mussalim, 
and even those of an inferior rank, think it is 
too great condescension in them to rise from 
their seats, and salute an infidel ; and, on the 
other hand, a consul will not go into the presence 
of any officer, whatever his distinction may be, 
unless he is received standing ; so that this method 
was agreed upon as a salvo for the honour of 
both : and these preliminaries, with several 

7 



98 THE LEVANT COMPANY IN CYPRUS 

others, are always settled by the intercourse 
of the dragoman, before the consul goes to 
audience. 

' After some commonplace speeches, and 
hollow assurances of friendship, which gold alone 
can realize, we were entertained with coffee, 
sweet-meats, and sherbet, and lastly, with per- 
fumes, which always imply a Ucence to withdraw. 
When the consul rose to take his leave, he was 
presented by the vazir with a kiirk, or robe lined 
with fur, WJiich was put upon him by one of the 
officers. 

' You may imagine this was a distinguishing 

mark of generosity, but I never heard of that 

virtue among the subjects of the Grand Signor ; 

and this vestment had been dearly bought by 

the presents which the consul had made him in 

the morning. From the presence-chamber we

Pococke ^ referring to him as being a Greek, 
but not giving his name. Sibthorp,* in 1787, 
also alludes to the presence there of a Vice-Consul, 
a Greek ; and de Vezin writes that * the English 
Consul has here {sc. Limasol) a Greek as Vice- 
Consul to give assistance to British ships calling 
here, and to see what is wanted in the town and 
neighbourhood.' ^ At Paphos a Cephalonian 
named Andrea Zimbulachi was established as 
British Agent in 1799 by Commodore Sir Sidney 
Smith, principally in order to attend to the 
provisioning of British men-of-war. This gentle- 
man was succeeded in 1826 by his son, whom he 
christened Smith in honour of his patron ; and 
Smith Zimbulachi held the office until 1864.* 
At Famagusta, too, in the nineteenth century, 
there was a British Consular Agent, a Latin 
named Brunoni, who was nominated to that 
post by Antonio Vondiziano, apparently in the 
days of the Levant Company. The Levant 
Company, during its lifetime, not only paid but 
appointed all British Consuls and Consular 
Officers in Turkey*; moreover, until 1825 
the seal used on official Consular documents bore, 
not the British, but the Company's arms.

an official of the Imperial and Tuscan Consulates, 
from 1760 to 1767, has left us the following 
account of the English Consulate in the Island ; 

* Mr. Timothy Turner, the English Consul, 

died in 1768, while I was writing this work. 

He was an officer of the Levant Company, but 

held a commission from his Britannic Majesty. 

Under commissions from their several Embassies 

at Constantinople he acted as vice-consul for the 

Empire, Tuscany, Denmark and Holland. The 

authority of the English consul is not so large 

as that of his French colleague. He can inflict 

trifling punishments, but he cannot at once 

banish his proteges, except when some very grave 

crime womd injure the repute of his nation 

in the eyes of the local government, or when 

he knows that one of his subjects is about to 

embrace the Mohammedan faith. In these cases 

he can examine the matter, and put the accused 

under restraint until an opportunity comes of 

sending him back to Europe. The English 

consulate has an English Chancellor, approved 

by the Levant Company, as well as a Tuscan 

Chancellor, approved by the Imperial Internuncio 

Constantinople, who is at the service of the 

aperial and Tuscan subjects, while Dutchmen 

id Danes avail themselves of the help of the 

iglish Chancellor. The English dragoman is 

lid by the Levant Company, but receives from 

6 consul further remuneration for his services 

the other consular proteges.''

THE LEVANT COMPANY IN CYPRUS loi 

By the beginning of the nineteenth century 
only one English merchant remained in Cyprus ; 
and he, according to Light, * had to contend with 
the united phalanx of Levantines, who had no 
inclination to admit a competitor in trade. An 
Englishman wishing to settle there will be exposed 
to much opposition, and will only succeed by 
having large funds to meet every exigency to 
which he is liable. Much of the trade is contra- 
band, particularly corn : and it is necessary to 
keep on good terms with the aga and officers 
employed at the custom-hoiise by presents, the 
best and only means of ensuring favour in any 
competition with Levantines.' ^ 

The solitary Englishman alluded to by Light 
was probably the Mr. How who is referred to 
by Turner. 'William Turner in 1815,' says 
Jeffery, * foxfnd an Englishman named How living 
at Larnaca with a native wife, who was, perhaps, 
the last survivor of the community, and who 
seems to have shown the English graveyard of 
S. Lazarus to the rare English visitors, and dis- 
- coursed about former times, doubtless in the 
garrulous manner of such stranded survivors all 
the world over. According to this individual, 
the English Factory in Cyprus had consisted of 
fifteen or sixteen houses, which would have made 
an important community. " When Cyprus was 
yet considerable in the hands of the Turks, and 
an English Factory resided here, Ormidhia was 
their favourite village, where they had their 
villas." '

102 THE LEVANT COMPANY IN CYPRUS 

The Levant Company came to an end in 
1825, not so much on account of any short- 
comings in its administration, as because the 
growing complexity of Turkey's relations with 
the Great Powers rendered it desirable for the 
British representatives in the Ottoman Empire 
to be directly responsible to the Government. 
The Company's announcement to its Agent and 
Vice-Consul in Cyprus of the transfer of its 
authority to the Crown, and Mr, Canning's 
instructions to the Consuls in the Levant, will 
be found in Chapter IIL 

I will conclude this chapter with three quota- 
tions referring to the consulages payable in respect 
of Cyprus to the Levant Company and its officers. 
The first is extracted from the manuscript register 
of the British Consulate in Egy'pt for the years 
1708 to 1742, a volume which in some unexplained 
manner has found its way into the archives of 
the Consulate of Cyprus : 

* At a General Court of the Levant Company 
held at Salters hall on fryday the 12th of Septem- 
ber, 1729, 

* A State of the Companys affaires in Turky 
was now read, and taken into consideration, And 
in order to prevent the Company running into 
debt, and paying a high interest. It is Resolved, 
and Ordered 

' That a Consulage Extraordinary of two Pr. 
Cent (over and above what is now paid) be levyed 
upon all Goods exported from Turky and Egypt 
for the port of London, and that the same be 
paid at Constantinople, Smyrna, Aleppo, Cairo, 
Cyprus, Tripoly di Soria, and all other places 
in Turky within sixty days after the departure 
of any Ship or Ships from the respective ports 
aforesaid for the Companys sole use and benefit. 
And this order is to commence and take place 
on its arrivall at the severall places aforesaid. 

^ And the Lord Ambassador at Constantinople 
is desired and the respective Consuls at Smyrna, 
Aleppo, Cyprus and Cairo, or any other Consuls, 
or Vice Consuls at any part in Turky, are required 
to see this Order duely comply'd with. 

^Wm. Dunster, Dep. Govr., 
and fifteen other signatures.' 

7he Levant Cotnfany^s Orders and By-Laws^ 
published in 1800,* contain the following article : 

* No. Ixxxix 

* That the consuls at Cyprus, Tripoly, Latachia, 
and Salonica, may appropriate to their own use 
two fer cent, on all goods laden from any place in 
His Majesty's dominions ; and the consulage 
exceeding two per cent, together with all consul- 
ages on imports, are to be remitted to the Com- 
pany's treasurer at Constantinople.' 

The third quotation is from Turner* :

able, owing to the numerous vessels that come

CHAPTER III 

THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES, 1710-1878 ^ 

The earliest documents belonging to the archives 
of the British Consulate in Cyprus are three 
Imperial Firmans of the middle of the eighteenth 
century, which will be quoted below. There 
are, however, sundry references to Cyprus, of 
earlier dates, in the register of the Consulate of 
Egypt referred to in the previous chapter. The 
following is an example : 

* Wee Wm. Farrington Consull for her Majestie 
of Great Brittaine, France & Ireland, &c., in 
Cairo & all ye Kingdom of Egypt, &c.. Do by 
these Presents recommend ye bearer hereof Simon 
w**^ his Companion Sergius, Greek Priests belong- 
ing to ye Convent of Santa Catarina on Mount

of her Britannick Majesty or of those in Alliance

showed them will on all Occasions gratefully be 
acknowledged.

The two priests in question were presumably 
visiting Cyprus in order to inspect the metochia 
(monastic dependencies), whidi the monastery 
of S. Katharine of Mt. Sinai possessed, and still 
possesses, in the Island. 

The first of the Firmans is a Berat confirming 
the appointment of George Barton as English 
Consul in Cyprus ; it is a prototype of what 
would now be called an Exequatur, and is the 
only document of its kind among the archives (1^ :

was appointed Vice-Consul ; and the next 
document of any note is a despatch addressed 
by him to the Embassy in Constantinople, 
wherein allusion is made to the movements of 
British ships consequent upon Bonaparte's opera- 
tions in Egypt. The letter derives additional 
interest from a reference to Nelson :

during Sir Sidney Smith's presence at that port : 

' Larnaca, CypBua,

' An express dispatch by Sir Sydney Smith 
affords me a very little time, only to acquaint 
you with my proceedings since writing last. , . . 
We arrived at Kelndr ' on the 8th of February. 
On the loth we passed the channel in a little 
Polacre schooner, and arrived at Cerina [Kyrenial, 
on the North side of the island on the morning 
of the nth. We crossed the island through 
Lifcosia, and arrived at this port on the 14th. 

' We have had sometimes considerable fatigue 
on the road and always very hard fare ; but on 
the whole, our journey has been very curious and 
delightful. We have been favoured with a con- 
tinuation of fine weather, such as is seldom seen 
in England in the middle of the summer ; and 
which only inconvenienced us by the heat. We 
have not been interrupted by a single wet day. 
I have kept an accurate journal, which I mean 
1 continue, but I have not time to copy it by 
lis opportunity.

* Before this letter arrives you will probably 
have heard of the treaty concluded by the media-

The connexion of Sir Sidney Smith with 
Cyprus gave rise to episodes very typical of his 
romantic and somewhat vainglorious and fantastic 
nature. An elder brother of Spencer Smith, 
the British Ambassador in Constantinople alluded 
to above,' Sir Sidney was despatched at the end 
of 1798 to the eastern Mediterranean in command 
of the Tigre, being at the same time entrusted
with a Commission from the Foreign Office, 
appointing him a joint Plenipotentiary with his 
brother the Ambassador. Sir Sidney's defence 
of S. Jean d'Acre in May, 1799, is historic ; but 
little known are his intervention in the internal 
aflfairs of Cyprus in November of the same year, 
and the strange conclusions which he subsequently 
drew from an incident that occurred at his meet- 
ing with the Archbishop of Cyprus, Chrysanthos, 
in Nicosia. The story is best given in Sir 
Sidney's own words, taken from a letter written 
by him some years afterwards to Bishop Lus- 
combe, English chaplain in Paris, where Sir 
Sidney then resided

I the exercise of my duty, representing the 
in his dignity, as his minister pleoipotfintiaiy 
e Ottoman Porte, and being decorated by 
a Selim with his imperial aigrette, and with 
nmission to command his forces by sea 
land, on the coast of Syria and Egypt, 
quently representing that sovereign in his 
irity, in the absence of the grand vizier, 
ighness being the one to exert it when 
It, and as the Capitan Pasha was expressly 
sersonally under my orders, 1 thought it 
uty to land at Cyprus, for the purpose of 
ing subordination and the hierarchy of 
trity, on a sudden emergency, which arose 

the bursting out of an insurrection of 
aries, Arnauts and Albanians, in the year 

after the raising of the siege of Acre. The 
jents having murdered their local immediate 

in the island, the Greek population was at 

mercy, and under dismay and terror. I 
d on the instant, and exercising the dele- 
. authority of Sultan Selim, as if he had been 

in person, and wearing his imperial aigrette 
ume of triumph, I restored order by re- 
lisliing the hierarchy of authority and catising 
lisbanded troops to go down to the beach, 
ily slinking wolves, foiled in their blood- 

r career, and then to embark, leaving the 
tranqinl and free from the previous appre- 
on of plunder and massacre. 
'n visiting the venerable Greek Archbishop 
vards at the capital, to prevent him from 
icing himself by a visit to me, which I 
understood was his intention, his grace met me 
outside the city gates. I of course dismounted 
to receive his welcome and animated harangue, 
at the termination of which he embraced me 
paternally, and at the same moment adroitly 
threw the Templar's Cross, which he wore as 
an episcopal decoration on his breast, around 
the neck of his English guest saying, " This 
belonged to an Englishman formerly, and I now 
restore it. It belonged to Saint Richard, 
Agio Richardoy surnamed Cceur de Lion, who 
left it in this Church at his departure, and it 
has been preserved in our treasury ever since ; 
eighteen archbishops, my predecessors, have 
signed to the receipt thereof, in succession. I 
now make it over to you in token of our gratitude 
for saving all our lives — the Archbishops, ecclesi- 
astics, laymen, citizens, and peasantry." With 
other complimentary expressions, I found myself 
thus in the consideration of the Greek population, 
invested with ecclesiastical authority, which also 
the Turkish authorities, and comparatively minor 
Mahomedan population, respected as such ; and 
I was thus enabled to quell a Greek insurrection 
by my good offices between the conflicting parties, 
disarming the Greek insurgents, and sending 
them home with their grievances redressed. 

* You are aware that the Grand Master of the 
Knights Templars was at Cyprus when he re- 
ceived the mandate of the Kin^ of France, Philip 
the Fair, and the contemporary pope to go to 
Paris, and justify himself and the order against 
the foul charges of two apostate Knights, suborned 
by those who speculated on their spoils from 
confiscation. The grand master never returned, 
but was burnt near the Pont Neuf, with other 
Knights, then falsely accused and unjustly dealt 
by. You may not be aware that the surviving 
Knights, justly despising the impotent bull 
which pretended to abolish an order, not created 
by, and wholly independent of, the papal 
authority, the forced terms of which buU " sus- 
pends in perpetuo,'^ admitted the impossibility 
of abolition and extinction, and forthwith, that 
a new grand master was elected in secret, and has 
continued to maintain the order in due form and 
consistence ever since. 

' Thus it has not ceased to exist ; and the 
Grand Master and his Council recognizing me 
as a new Knight Templar elect, duly received me, 
and voting me to be qualified by the above 
antecedents, recorded me as Grand Prior of 
England, an authority which Richard I exercised 
after he had become the purchaser of the land of 
the Order in Cyprus. I have ceded this dignity 
to a most illustrious and a more worthy personage 
(nevertheless I do not thereby cease to belong 
to the Order, having received a higher dignity 
therein) — and it is unquestionably a holy order, 
considering its origin and attributes among the 
primitive Christians ; and considering that I did 
not understand the whole of the Greek Arch- 
bishop's speech, at the moment of the investiture, 
I may have been ordained without being quite 
aware of it ; and if so, or under the doubt in my 
mind, which suddenly arises by learning that the 
Grand Prior of Portugal is a candidate for church 
preferment, which proves him to be an ecclesias- 
tic ; I hesitate to take the oath as tendered to 
me (to enable me to receive my half pay) in its 
precise form, requiring me to assert that I am 
not in holy orders ; my appeal to your Lordship 
is to have my mind satisfied on the historically 
recorded quality of the Knights Templars in 
England, previous (probably) to my taking the 
said required oath.' 

We may safely assume that the Archbishop's 
action, in giving Sidney Smith what was pre- 
sumably his pectoral cross, was intended simply 
as an act of courtesy, wholly devoid of the esoteric 
significance which the latter subsequently pro- 
fessed to discover in it. It may be remarked that 
the Commodore's political interferences in 
Turkey were by no means to the taste of his 
own Government. Indeed, Lord Elgin, who 
succeeded Spencer Smith as Ambassador to the 
Porte, goes so far as to say, in a letter written to 
Lord Nelson on January 15, 1800, that Sidney 
Smith ^ has assumed the character of Minister 
Plenipotentiary, grounded upon his having had 
that nomination to enable him to sign, with his 
brother, a treaty here last winter : he continues 
this title without confirmation, instructions, or 
powers from home. And he has exerted it upon 
different occasions to exercise police in Cyprus 
and elsewhere ; a fact literally without precedent 
in diplomatic history. This has brought upon 
our arms the utmost ill-will ; it serves as an 
apology for backwardness in the Turks, and has 
given occasion to most unpleasant scenes in the 
Seraglio, where we have of "necessity enemies to 
our alliance.' 

Sidney Smith, who became full Admiral in 
1821 and a G.C.B. in 1838, died in 1840 at the 
age of seventy-five. 

We must now turn our attention once again 
to the Orthodox hierarchy of Cyprus, and to the 
reaction against their ascendancy, which was 
referred to at the end of Chapter I. Loxiis 
Lacroiz, in his lies de la Grece,^ well describes 
the state of Turkish popular feeling, which led 
to the outbreaks of 1804 and 1821 : 

' The Greek clergy had preserved in Cyprus 

an influence which was only impaired by the 

serious troubles ivhich, at the beginning of this 

century, affected all the countries inhabited by 

people of Hellenic race. The Archbishop of 

Nicosia, who had the title of ri'aya-vekili, as 

representing the Christian subjects of the Porte, 

had annexed pretty well the whole administrative 

^'"¦hority, and not only had made himself in- 

lendent of the Muhassils, but generally deter- 

led on their appointment and recall. From 

palace the Archbishop administered the whole 

ad, filled up the offices in every district,

accustomed to take no notice of the MuhassiL 
The supreme power of the Archbishops of Nicosia 
reached its height during the reigns of Selim HI 
and. Mustafa IV, the immediate predecessors of 
Sultan Mahmud II, and was unshaken until the 
beginning of the nineteenth centurj*-, in 1804, 
saw an insurrectionary movement of the Turks, 
the prelude of the bloody catastrophe which was 
to extinguish it. The Turks settled in Cyprus 
were deeply hurt at seeing themselves fallen under 
the rule of men whom of old they had conquered. 
The Turkish population of Nicosia and the adjoin- 
ing villages, stirred by a rumour, true or false, of 
an insufficiency in the foodstuffs necessary for 
the victualling of the island, rose against the 
ecclesiastical authority, in whose hands all power 
rested, and for a while was master of the capital. 
The arrival of two Pashas from Asia Minor with 
a fair show of troops, the intervention, which 
always had its weight, of the Consuls of France, 
England and Russia, MM. Regnault, Peristiani, and 
Calimeri,* stilled this passing ferment, and things 
appeared to resume their accustomed course. 
But the intrigues of the chief Turks against the 
Greek headmen did not sleep, and ended in 1821 
in a bloody coup (Tetat^ which put an end to 
the administration of the Muhassils, overturned

the authority of the Greek clergy, and restored the 
government of the Pashas.'^ 

As Lacroix rightly observes, the rising pf 1804 
was itself not serious ; it was merely the prelude 
to the events of 1821. No contemporary corre- 
spondence as to the occurrence survives among 
the archives, but a private letter, dated August, 
1809, from Vondiziano to his friend Bartolommeo 
Pisani, First Interpreter to the British Embassy 
in Constantinople, throws some interesting light 
on its results : 

* Worthy Sir and Dear Friend, (I) 

* . . . Owing to the necessities of the 
country on the occasion of the rising of the 
Turks in 1 804, the Greek Bishops had recourse for 
considerable loans to the Consuls, all of whom 
came to their assistance, lending to them against 
notes of hand, wherein the Bishops undertook 
to repay within a short time. They have hitherto, 
however, been unable to meet their obligations ; 
and I myself am unfortunately a creditor to the 
extent of 40,000 piastres.* . . . The Bishops 
do not know how to find the money ; and as if 
Cyprus were not in a sufficiently critical condition, 
it has the additional misfortune of seeing beside 
the Governor as Kiehaya a certain Cypriote 

^ Excerpta, pp. 463-4. 

* An Imperial Firman of June 16, 181 2, orders the repayment 
to Vondiziano of three-quarters of this sum from public funds, 
the Bishops having expended 30,000 piastres in chartering the 
vessels which brought the troops from Asia Minor to Cyprus to 
suppress the disturbances. 

named Ali EflFendi. . . . This bandit has suc- 
ceeded in obtaining complete ascendancy over 
the mind of the Governor, and in league with the 
other officials commits daily iniquities, unjustly 
fleecing the wretched population on the most 
frivolous pretexts. Moreover, he has established 
a sort of monopoly on foodstuffs, forcibly taking 
the unhappy peasants' wheat and barley at con- 
temptible prieesj^ and in false measure, with no 
consideration for the debtors of the Europeans.. 
Notwithstanding our complaints at these un- 
worthy proceedings, the vexations continue^ ... 
The poor Bishops, who are troubled beyond 
measure at such tyranny' on the part of the 
Kiehaya Bey, have approached me in all secrecy, 
adjuring me in the Lord's Name to secure your 
aid in this matter, so that it may result in the* 
deposition and exile from Cyprus of the aforesaid 
Ali Effendi, Kiehaya Bey of our Governor. * 

We may justly doubt if the poverty of the 
Bishops was as great as this letter would imply** 
Vondiziano wrote, no doubt, in absolute good 
faith ; but the following quotation from Ali Bey,  
whose visit to Cyprus took place less than two 
years after the rising, suggests that the Bishops- 
gave to their creditors an exaggerated impression' 
of their financial straits : 

'^^ The Greeks are extremely submissive and 
respectful towards their bishops : in saluting 
them they bow low, take off their cap, and hold 

^ cf. p. 83. 

it before them upside down. They scarcely 
dare speak in their presence. It is true that for 
this community of slaves the bishops are rallying 
points. It is through them that it preserves 
some kind of existence, so that it suits the people 
to give their prelates political importance, such 
as even the Turks allow them, judging by the 
deferential and respectful manner which they 
observe towards the bishops. These, on their 
part, parade in their houses and followers a 
princely luxury ; they never go out without 
a crowd of attendants, and to ascend a flight of 
stairs they must needs be carried by their 
servants.' ' 

It will probably be convenient at this point to 
interrupt the chronological sequence of the 
archives in order to complete, with an accoxmt 
of the events of 1821, the story of the supremacy 
of the Archbishops. The disturbance of 1804 
had but served to fan the flame of Turkish dis- 
content ; and the outbreak of the Greek War of 
Independence gave the Qapitan Pasha the desired 
opportunity to reassert his authority. Of various 
iptions that have been preserved of the 
ssive measures taken by the Musellim of 
as, Kiichuk (i.e. ' little ') Mehmed, in

movement in the island, that of Lacroix ' 
,rs to be the most judicial : 

yprianos was then {sc. 1821) Archbishop of 
IS, and the government of the island had 

' Excerpt/2, p. 396. * Op. cit. 


been since 1820 in the hands of Kuchuk Mehmed, 
a man of imperious and dissembling temper, 
whom the Captan Pasha had chosen purposely 
to destroy the influence of the Greek Primate. 
Circumstances soon favoured the execution of 
his plan. The first insurrectionary movements 
in Moldavia and Peloponnesus, which had burst 
a little after the arrival of Kuchuk Mehmed in 
Cyprus, while they inspired the Ottoman Govern- 
ment with the liveliest fear, sanctioned every 
measure which its agents could adopt to keep 
in check their Christian subjects in the provinces 
which had not risen. Now the Greeks of Cyprus 
had remained entirely aloof from the national 
movement which had stirred the other islands 
and the Greek mainland. " It was not they who 
were crying out against tyranny, and thought of 
taking up arms : it was the Turks, who were 
impatient of the bondage in which the bishops 
had kept them for fifty years past : it was for 
them that reaction and liberation were on foot."

In fact Kuchuk Mehmed, under pretext of keeping 
down the Greek population, which only wanted 
to remain quiet, and in reality to snatch back 
the reins of power, brought over from the moun- 
tains of the Anti Libanus bands of Arabs, Bedouins 
and Ansariya brigands, and scattered them about 
the island. The Greeks, terror-struck, allowed 
themselves to be disarmed to avoid all excuse for 
suspicion. The Archbishop Kyprianos protests 
his love of peace, his submission to the government 
of the Grand Signor. Kuchuk Mehmed persists 
in inventing a plot, persuades the Grand Vezir 
of its reality : he, being perhaps a party to the 
stratagem, allows the Governor to make an ex- 
ample by the severe punishment of the leaders.

Free to act, Kuchuk Mehmed on July 9, 1821, 
orders the arrest of the Archbishop and the other 
three bishops. They were taken to the Serai, 
and were scarcely inside before they were mur- 
dered by the janissaries. The Greek notables, 
who were summoned later, before the news of 
the slaughter of the prelates had spread, met the 
same fate. The gates of the palace were then 
opened, and the bleeding corpses thrown into 
the square. This was the signal for a general 
massacre. The convent of Phaneromene was 
at once occupied, and the priests strangled. I 
was told, says M. de Mas Latrie, that before killing 
them the Turks, with a wild refinement of 
vengeance, saddled the priests, as they would 
their horses, breaking their teeth to force the bits 
into their mouths, and making them caper ilnder 
their spurs. The Greek houses were given over 
to pillage, massacres began again, in all the dis- 
tricts of the island, and confiscation followed 
massacre. For six months universal terror

01- affairs of Cyprus, much of the Consular corre- 
[es, spondence of the early years of the nineteenth 
i century reveak glimpses of Napoleon's activities 
[\t in the Near East.' A curious file of February, 
1806, contains a lengthy accusation formulated 
by L. A. Corancez, then French Commissaire 
General at Aleppo, against the English Consul, 
John Barker, for having procured the assassination 
I of a French General named Romieu somewhere 
east of the Euphrates, together with Consul 
Barker's indignant refutation of the charge. In 
the same year Sebastiani, subsequently Marshal 
of France and Ambassador in London, was 
despatched by Napoleon to Turkey in order to 
break up the alliance of the Porte with England 
^ and Russia, a mission in which he was suc- 
j cessful.*

On July 5 Pisani writes as follows to Vondiziano 
from Constantinople : 

* Honoured Sir, (I) 

* You will have learned by now of the 
occupation of Ragusa by I3,cx)0 Frenchmen, 
whose numbers will, I fear, increase. On the 
one hand they act thus, on the other they are 
making great preparations in their Palace here 
for the reception of Sebastiani, appointed Am- 
bassador Extraordinary. Everything is obscure. 
Nevertheless, all is peaceful here, and an army on 
the New System of 40,000 men has arrived under 
Caady Pasha, incredibly well-disciplined. . . .' 

Correspondence between Vondiziano and Isaac 
Morier, a member of the distinguished family 
of diplomatists and father of the author of the 
immortal Haji Baba^ indicates the status of the 
Levant Company with regard to Consular busi- 
ness, as well as the importance attached by 
rayahs to the privilege of European Consular 
protection :

A letter dated June 12, 1807, addressed to 



138 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

Vondiziano by a Cypriote merchant named 
Calimeri,^ resident in Tripoli in Syria, casts 
an unpleasing side-light on conditions in the 
Lebanon, which since 1697 had been a feudal 
principality, tributary to the Porte, under the 
Druse dynasty of Shehab : 

* . . . leur lettre du 23 passe annonce la mort 
tragique des 2 Ministres operee par les Princes 
Bechir " & Hassan regnant aujourdhui, lesquels 
ont fait crever les yeux aux trois fils de I'Emir 
Youssef, leurs debiteurs. Comme les Princes 
Bechir & Hassan sont mes amis je me propose de 
leur ecrire p' tacher de recevoir le payement des 
2 m. p"^ Je me flatte de reussir, mais je ne 
saurais pourtant I'assurer ; par mes prem"^ 
vous saurez le resultat de mes demarches.' 

In September, i8io, a Firman was issued by 
the Sultan, protecting by rigorous orders the 
monopoly which the Turkish Government exer- 
cised over the sale of wheat. The following is 
the official French translation which accompanied 
the copy of the Firman despatched to Cyprus : 

^ Traduction d'un Commandement Imperial 

^ The Larnaca family known by the sobriquet of Calimeri is 
in reality a branch of the ancient family of De Nores and perhaps 
the only survivor in the island of the feudal Frankish nobility 
of mediaeval Cyprus ; cf . Mas Latrie, UiU de Chyfrey Sa situation 
fresente, &c., p. 363.

banished to Malta.

Turquie aux Batimens etrangers et francs, ainsi 
qu'aux Bateaux des lies de PArchipel ; et cette 
prohibition a ete de temps k autres confirmee par

emanes a cet effet. Neanmoins il a ete verifie 
et assure que quelques personnes perverses 
poussees par une extreme avidite, ammassent le 
ble dans leurs magasins, et bien loin de Pexpedier 
a Constantinople, ils Penvoient secretement des

^ A la reception du present Ordre Imperiale 
vous Vezirs, Miri-Mirans, Pachas, Juges et autres

In the same year (1810) we find Vondiziano 
complaining to Pisani of the pretensions advanced 
by his subordinate Francoudes, British Consular 
Agent at Limasol, to official independence of the 
Larnaca Vice-Consulate. Vondiziano describes 
Francoudes as a Greek who had ingratiated 
himself with British Naval Officers by provision- 
ing, in 1799, the Squadron which called at 
Limasol under Commodore Sir Samuel Hood 
on its way to blockade Alexandria. Limasol was 
at that time an insignificant place as compared 
with Larnaca, which is described by Vondiziano 
as ^ il centro di tutto Cipro.' He continues : 
* E sempre stato I'antico uso di Cipro di tutte le 
nazione di nominare li Consoli di Larnaca ' ; a 
usage which continues to the present day. 

Most travellers who visited Cyprus in Turkish 
times remarked on the ceremony which was 
maintained by the Consular Corps at Larnaca. 
Thus Light observes : * I was often amused by 
the assumed dignity of the different representa* 
tives of European nations at Larnaca, where the 
Austrian, Neapolitan, French, and Spanish Consuls 
had their residence, arid where etiquette of pre- 
cedency was pushed to a degree not known in our 
own country ; all except the French Consul were 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 147 

engaged in trade.' * Every year, with unfailing 
regularity, the Consuls advised their colleagues 
in pompous language of the birthdays of their 
respective Sovereigns, whom they generally de- 
scribed as ^ mon Auguste Maitre,' so that the 
auspicious anniversary should meet with due 
observance. Of this class of correspondence the 
following letter is an example, more interesting 
than most because of the special circumstances 
that provoked it : 

* Relations Exterieures.

148 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

On July 26, 1 8 14, Vondiziano writes as follows 
to Pisani : 

^ Honoured Sir, (I) 

^ Your esteemed letter of April 27 only 
reached me yesterday, by way of Nicosia. Before 
referring to its contents, I must advise you of the 
arrival in Cyprus of the Commandant of Antioch, 
Haji Bekir Agha, an excellent person, who was 
protected in 1800 by Sir Sidney Smith from the 
persecution of the Grand Vizier, He is a great 
friend of Consul Barker of Aleppo, also of my own 
and of all the English travellers ; and he is now 
being persecuted by the Pasha (Basci^) of Aleppo, 
who has gone to Antioch and made an inventory 
of his possessions. After leaving Antioch, Haji 
Bekir Agha was invited by the Pasha to return, 
with the promise that no harm would come to 
him ; but, distrusting the invitation, he decided 
to proceed to Cyprus, whence he will shortly 
depart for Rhodes. From Rhodes he will travel 
at once to the capital, where he has some powerful 
protectors among the members of the Divan. 

* Seeing that he is a person who merits every 
help and protection, I take the liberty of recom- 
mending him to your well-known goodness and 
kindness to those in trouble. . . .' 

In the postscript to a letter of March 10, 18 15, 
from Vondiziano to Isaac Morier, the name of 
Lady Hester Stanhope, Pitt's eccentric niece, 
who eventually established herself in feudal state 
in the Lebanon, appears for the first time in these 
archives :

The following are extracts from letters written 
by Pisani to Vondiziano from Constantinople in 
the course of 1816-17 :

' . . . I have now to ask of you a personal 
favour, which I beg that you will carry out with 
caution and with your customary discretion. 
A month ago the Government unexpectedly 
ordered the arrest of two of the principal Armen- 
ian bankers one named Manuk Hudaverdi, the
other Kilji Oglu Khoja Anton— an event which 
has caused the utmost astonishment, as both 
persons enjoy an excellent reputation and are 
most usefiJ to the public service. It is all a 
question of jealousy and spite. Both gentlemen, 
however — they are great friends of mine — have 
to-day been sent into exile, Khoja Anton to 
Cyprus and Manuk to Rhodes. 

' The favour I ask of you is to send some one 
to comfort Khoja Anton, and to extend to him 
such help and good oflfices as it is customary to 
offer to exUes. . . ,'

at the end of the autumn. . . . The new Russian 
Envoy, Count Strogonow, has not yet arrived. 
He is, however, expected daily from Odessa. The 
Chevalier ItalinsH, a man genuinely respected, 
is destined for the appointment of Minister in 
Rome. 

^ I am very obliged to you for the information 
you gave me about the Princess of Wales. We 
had her here for eleven days. But I am surprised 
at what you say about the behaviour of Soliman 
Pasha ; the more so as H.R.H. had a letter of 
recommendation to him. There must have been 
a special motive. 

* Four weeks ago an Algerine Ambassador 
arrived here, escorted as far as the Dardanelles 
by His Majesty's Frigate Tagus, Captain Dun- 
dass. He has brought presents valued at over a 
million piastres Turkish, which are much appre- 
ciated at the Porte and in the Seraglio. In two 
months' time the said Frigate is to return to 
fetch him. The plague has broken out in various 
parts of the city, but with little violence. . . .'

On August 3, 1 8 19, an act of piracy was com- 
mitted off Cape Gata (south of Limasol), on the 
English brig Helen, The Chief Secretary to the 
Government of Malta, in enclosing a brief report 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 155 

on the case, writes as follows to the British Vice- 
Consul in Cyprus : 

' Chief Secretary's Office, 

* Valletta, 

* September 14, 1819. 

' Sir, 

* I have the honor to transmit for your 
information Copy of a letter addressed by the 
British Consul at Alicant to His Excellency 
General Don, Lieutenant Governor of Gibraltar, 
detailing an act of most atrocious piracy com- 
mitted on the English Brig Helen from Liverpool, 
bound to Genoa while off Cape de Gatt — by 
a vessel supposed to be British. 

* I have further to acquaint you, that since the 
receipt of the above communication at Malta, a 
variety of Reports have been made to this Govern- 
ment tending in the strongest manner to attach 
suspicion on a vessel which arrived in this Island 
on the 29th ultimo, and which sailed again from 
hence for Smyrna on the 2nd instant. 

^ This vessel is the William^ Christopher Delano 
Master, of and from Liverpool — and from her 
perfectly answering the description given of the 
pirate — and from the conduct of the Master, who 
is an American, and of the crew thereof, during 
her stay here, as stated by a variety of persons 
upon oath before a Magistrate, there is every 
reason to suppose that she is the very same vessel 
which committed the said piracy. 

* The whole of this information will be im- 
mediately transmitted to the Command in Chief

of His Majesty's Naval Forces. In the meantime 
a vessel h^ been taken up here by the Merchants 
and some additional hands put on board of her, 
belonging to His Majesty's Ship Spey — and she 
was despatched on the 12th inst. for Smyrna in 
search of the William.

On February 21, 1820, Pisani writes as follows 
to Vondiziano (I) : 

* Well knowing your friendly zeal in all matters 
appertaining to the service of Lady Hester 
Stanhope, I am taking the liberty to address to 
your care a small box for her Ladyship, which 
I beg that you will forward to her by whatever 
means you may judge expedient. 

* The box merely contains some sealing wax, 
paper, pens, and simUar trifles. . . .' 

In the spring of 1821 began the War of Greek 
Independence, but it was not until the Treaty of 
July 6, 1827, that Great Britain, France, and 
Russia recognized Greece as a belligerent State. 
Until that date Great Britain remained officially 
neutral ; and a circular despatch of June 7, 1823, 
from His Majesty's Consul-General in Constan- 
tinople to the Consular Ofiicers within his juris- 
diction enjoins on them carefully to abstain 
from all action tending * to offend against the 
principles of neutrality, which the British Govern- 
ment desires its Agents and subjects to observe 



iS8 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

in the present War between the Sublime Ottoman 
Porte and the Insurgents.' 

The warning appears to have been needed, 
for on October 6, 1823, Vondiziano received a 
reprimand from the Vice-Admiral Commander- 
in-Chief for having, on April 6 of that year, 
* freighted the British Merchant Vessel Nancy 
for a voyage to Jaffa to carry thither 10,000 
Dollars and 600 Cannon Balls for the Pasha.' 
The Nancy was stopped on her way ^ by a Greek 
Schooner, which took her into St. Jean d'Acre, 
seized the Money and landed the Cannon Balls ' : 
and the Admiral complained that by his action 
the Consul had ' exposed the British Merchant 
Flag to insult.' 

In 1825 the Levant Company surrendered its 
Charter to the King ; and henceforth the powers 
it had hitherto exercised were vested in the 
Crown. The Company thus notified the change 
to its representative and Vice-Consul in Cyprus : 

* London, May 19, 1825. 

' Sir, 

* We have now to apprize you that our 
Authority is, this day, transferred to the Crown. 

* It being part of the arrangement with His 
Majesty's Government, that our Officers in 
Turkey are to be taken into the King's Service, 
you will on receipt of this letter, consider yourself 
released from your engagement with Us, and 
follow only the instructions which you may 
receive from His Majesty^s Secretary of State 
for Foreign Affairs.

prosperity, 

' We are, Sir, 

*Your sincere Friends, 

* The Governor and Company of Merchants 
OF England trading into the Levant Seas. 

* Mr. Antonio Vondiziano, 

* Agent in Cyprus.' 

A despatch from the Foreign Secretary to the 
Consul-General in Constantinople explains in 
greater detail the changes involved by the transfer: 

* Foreign Office, May 30, 1825. 
^SlR, 

* The Levant Company having petitioned 
The King that they might be permitted to 
surrender their Charter into His Majesty's hands, 
and His Majesty having been graciously pleased 
to accept the same, I have to acquaint you that 
the Charters have accordingly been surrendered 
to His Majesty and that the authority of the 
Company over the Consuls and other subordinate 
Officers in the Levant is consequently vested in 
the Crown. 

* In acquainting you with this circumstance, 
I have at the same time to inform you, that Bills 
are now in progress through Parliament to confirm 
the transfer of the Levant Company and also for 
the better regulation of His Majesty's Consuls 
abroad, and that so soon as these acts shall have 
passed the Legislature, full and detailed Instruc- 



i6o THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

tions will be forwarded to His Majesty's Consuls 
in the Levant, for the future guidance of their 
conduct. 

* In the meantime I have to desire that you, 
as well as the several Consuls and other Officers 
in the Levant, will consider the Instructions you 
have heretofore received from the Company as 
the rule of your conduct in so far as the same arc 
applicable to the present circumstances. The 
Consuls in the Levant wiU report to the Consul 
General for the information of His Majesty's 
Minister at the Sublime Porte all occurrences 
connected with their Consulate and they will 
apply through the same channel to him upon 
all occasion, wherein they may require his assist- 
ance and information ; and they will not fail 
to obey such Instrucdons as they shaU from time 
to time receive from him for the guidance of 
their conduct in their official situation. 

' With the surrender of the Charters, the 
property and Funds of the Company have been 
transferred to the Crown ; and it has been deter- 
mined, in order to afford time to bring the new 
Consular arrangement to maturity, that the whole 
: Establishment in the Levant shall be con- 
i on its present footing, in point of Emolu- 
, until the 5th of January, 1826. In conse- 
:e, however, of the Consuls having been 
:ed by the Company to desist from collecting 
Lities and consulages subsequently to the ist 
irch last, Mr. Daubuz the late Treasurer has 
requested to defray the amount of Bills 
I may be drawn for the payment of the whole

of such salaries up to the 25 th of June next. 
I shall not fail to acquaint you for the information 
of the Parties interested, with the* arrangement 
which may be made for the future payment of 
those salaries from the 25th of June, 1825. 

^ You will communicate a Copy of this De- 
spatch to the several Consuls and to such of the 
other officers of the late Company in the Levant 
as may be necessary (sending me a list thereof), 
and you will direct them, to act in conformity 
with the instructions contained in it.

The battle of Navarino on October 20, 1827, 
although disavowed in the King's Speech as 
an " untoward event,'* led to the departure 
of the Ambassadors of the three Powers 
from Constantinople. Of the Powers Russia 
alone declared war on Turkey ; but the 
following despatch from the Ambassador shows 
how strained were the relations for a time between 
the Porte and Great Britain :

Ultimo, and to the Postscript accompanying it

i6a - THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

that in the event of your choosing to remain at 
your post under the present circumstances, and 
notwithstanding my departure and that of the 
French and Russian Representatives from Con- 
stantinople, you can remain only as a private 
individual. As it is possible, however, that if 
you were to discontinue the exercise of your 
Consular functions too suddenly, some incon- 
venience, not to say prejudice might result there- 
from to the interests of our Merchants, I have 
agreed with the French Ambassador since our 
arrival here to authorize you and yo»xr Colleague 
the French Consul to defer taking that step until 
the 15th of January next, provided you have no 
reason to apprehend any interference from the 
local government in the meantime. On that 
Day, if not before, you will close your Chancery 
and take down your Flag, availing yourself of 
the interval to make His Majesty's subjects in 
your Consulship fully aware of the critical state 
of affairs, and to provide by all means in your 
power for the security of their persons and 
property, against the contingency of a more 
decided rupture unfortunately taking place 
between the Porte and the three aUied Powers. 

' I have requested the Senior Officer on this 
Bt-^finn to send one of the vessels under his com- 
or the protection and eventual embarka- 
yourself and others of His Majesty's sub- 
your place of residence. The smallness 
¦orce and the number of demands upon

do whatever he can in concert with the 


French Admiral to send either a British or a 
French man of war for your protection in leaving 
the Country. 

^ After the cessation of your Consular Func- 
tions, the Chancery of the Dutch Consulship, 
agreeable to what I stated in the Postscript of 
my last Circular, will be open to the Transactions 
of any of our Merchants who may remain in the 
Country. 

* The French Consul will receive an instruction 
similar in substance to this, and you will act in 
concert with him on the subject, observing that 
the object of this instruction must be carried into 
eflfect at latest on the 15 th of January.

' His Britannic Majesty's Consul, 
' Larnaca, Cyprus.' 

f- During the interruption of diplomatic relations 
between Great Britain and Turkey Vondiziano 
remained in Cyprus, but, in accordance with the 
terms of the above despatch, his Consular func- 
tions were suspended until 1829, when by a letter 
from Consul- General Cartwright, dated Septem- 
ber 12 of that year, he was instructed to resume 
them. He describes his resumption of office in 
a letter of October 17, 1829, to the Consul- 
General (I) : 

^ On the loth of this month, invested in my 
honourable Consular functions, I caused His 
Majesty's flag to be hoisted at 9 a.m. It was 
saluted with 21 guns 'from the mortar of the 
Consulate, by 21 guns from the fort \sc. of 
Larnaca], and by various Ionian vessels that 
happened to be in port. All the foreign Consuls 
hoisted their flags and paid me visits of con- 
gratulation on the same day. . . . His Ex- 
cellency the Governor of the Island, Ali Ruki 
Effendi, who had been notified by me through my 
Dragoman, sent expressly to his residence, Nicosia, 
not only wrote to me a letter full of friendly 
expressions, but despatched here one of his high 
officials to congratulate me. This officer attended 
all the festivities and ordered the fort to give the 
above-mentioned salute, an honour hitherto 
conferred on no other Consul. He has also 
granted me a second Dragoman, rendered neces- 
sary by the desirability of expediting shipping 
affairs. 

* On the same day the flag was also hoisted 
at Limasol by the Consular Agent there, Signor 
Nicola Francudi, being saluted by the fort with 
7 guns in accordance with a Buyuruldu (decree) 
of the Governor. 

* I must here express my satisfaction with the 
zeal displayed by the Dutch Consul, Signor 
Marco Antonio Santi, in taking* charge of the 
interests of the English nation during the time 
that my consular functions were in abeyance.' 

In 183 1 the reforming Sultan Mahmud II, 
whose reign witnessed the loss of many Christian 
provinces, had also to face a revolt of his Moslem

subjects in Bosnia and Albania. The leader of 
this movement, one Husein Agha of Gradishka, 
* the Dragon of Bosnia,' gathered round his green 
standard at Banjaluka an army of Mohammedan 
Serbs and Arnauts, who resented the innovations 
of the * Giaour Sultan.' The Porte, in the course 
of the campaign which ensued, declared a blockade 
of the Albanian coast, which was announced to 
the Cyprus Consulate by the Consul-General 
in Constantinople in the following despatch : 

* April 28, 1 83 1 (I). 

*SlR, 

* I have to inform you that the Sublime 
Porte has officially notified His Excellency the 
Ambassador of a blockade which it proposes to 
establish against the portion of the Albanian 
coast which lies within the confines of the Pashalik 
of Scutari. 

' The blockade takes effect from the date of 
its notification, that is to say, from the 24th 
instant. 

* On the arrival of the Ottoman Squadron off 
the coasts of Albania, Frank vessels will be given 
24 hours' grace, after which the blockade 
will be enforced, the ports of Preveza and Arta 
being excluded from its operation. The blockade 
will extend from Durazzo to the extremity of the 
Ottoman dominions in the Gulf of Venice. All 
ports and harbours within these limits will be 
blockaded, and no vessel will be allowed to enter 
them. 

' You will be good enough to bring the blockade

to the notice of all British and Ionian subjects in 
your district.

* Mr. Antonio Vondiziano, ' 

' British Consular Agent in Cyprus.' 

One of the results of the recognition of the 
Greek Kingdom by the Powers was that many- 
Orthodox Cypriotes, anxious to emancipate them- 
selves from the status of rayahs, proceeded to 
Greece in order to acquire Hellenic citizenship. 
They would appear to have had little diflSculty 
in obtaining the privilege; for already in 183 1 
the number of Cypriotes who had returned to 
their native island with Greek passports was so 
considerable 'as to alarm the Turks, who were 
compelled to decree that persons thus naturalized, 
unless they had obtained the sanction of the 
Porte to their abandonment of Ottoman nation- 
ality, would resume that nationality should they 
return to Turkey. 

The Cypriotes of Larnaca affected by this order 
thereupon despatched the following appeal to 
the Russian Consul in Cyprus, as representing 
the Protecting Powers of Greece : 

* Marina (Larnaca), 

' December 3, 1831 (G). 

* To Mr. Constantine Peristiani, Consul of 
His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, 

* We have just learned with the utmost surprise 
that yesterday, following upon the reading of the 
orders of the Sublime Porte, His Beatitude the 
Archbishop, having summoned all Greek subjects 
in Nicosia in accordance with the instructions of 
the Governor of the island, made use of the most 
terrible threats in order to induce them to 
abandon their right to Hellenic protection and to 
remain in Cyprus in the condition of rayahs. 
This method having failed, for the Greeks were 
unanimous in wishing to depart after having 
settled their affairs, violence, with its accustomed 
barbarities, came to the aid of threats. 

* Our fellow-nationals, some dragged through 
the streets of Nicosia by the Governor's satellites, 
brutally beaten, and cast into prison, the others in 
hiding from the persecution of the Government, are 
unable through your mediation to seek the protec- 
tion of His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias. 

* The unparalleled abuses of the Governors of 
this wretched island have reduced a part of its 
inhabitants to flight ; and these, favoured by the 
article of the Protocol of London dealing with 
emigration, have obtained Greek nationality, 
prepared to leave their native land in order to 
escape from the vexations and depredations of an 
insatiable greed, which, having reached its height, 
has become unbearable. 

The boundless greed of the Governors, which 
always finds for its instruments certain individuals 
whose interest lies in pandering to it, has been 
the cause of the island's depopulation. 
' * It will be they who, by persisting in their 
diabolical methods, will reduce the island to total 
ruin, if the watchful eye of the Sublime Porte 
does not light upon them in time. 



i68 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

* It is not out of place, Sir, to point out to you 
here that among those who, by virtue of the 
article as to emigration in the Protocol of London, 
are in possession of Greek passports, are many who 
have lived in Greece since the beginning of the 
revolution, and have fought for its independence. 
Others, who hold public offices in Greece, have 
returned here by leave of the Government in 
order to settle their private affairs. The local 
Authorities, who are especially animated against 
the latter, will probably resort to acts of violence 
and aggression, if you, in your solicitude, do 
not take in this matter such st^P^ ^^ ^^7 ^^ 
opportune. 

^ In the meantime the undersigned Greek 
subjects at present in this town by this petition 
invoke in the names of the Greek Government 
and of the three Protecting Powers, your protec- 
tion. Sir, both for themselves and for all Greek 
subjects in this island, demanding full satisfaction 
for the acts of aggression lately committed in 
Nicosia against their fellow-nationals, and pro- 
testing formally against the local Authorities, who, 
by conduct so reprehensible and so hostile, are 
compromising their personal safety, their property, 
and their honour. 

^ In requesting you. Sir, to transmit true copies 
of this document to the two other Consulates of 
the allied and Protecting Powers of Greece, whose 
help we also solicit in this matter, 

* We have the honour to be with much respect,

THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 169 

In his report to the Consul-General in Con- 
stantinople, likewise dated December, 1831, 
Vondiziano describes the position from a some- 
what different point of view to that of the 
petitioners (I) : 

* . . . The object of this letter is to report to 
you the arrival of Hihsat Bey, who has been 
appointed Inspector- General, in order to take 
steps for the well-being of the Island. 

* He has made his official entry into Nicosia, 
and it appears, after the reading of his Firmans, 
that his principal object is to suppress the sedi- 
tious Hellenes, who are increasing daily in the 
Island, and have begun to give umbrage to the 
Turks. 

' In several of my reports I have called your 
attention to the emigration of these islanders ; 
the bulk of them go to Greece and return to their 
native country with Greek passports, which are 
accorded easily and without delay. Thus they
enter again into possession of their goods and 
their houses, exempt from all tribute and with the 
privileges of the Franks. To such an extent has 
this process been adopted by peasants and £ersons 
of all conditions, that, were it to continue, the 
island would shortly become a Greek colony, 
and the Sultan be left with nothing but the empty 
title of suzerain {padrone). An order has there- 
fore been issued that these, persons must revert 
to the category of rayah ; several have already 
been arrested, and it appears that rigorous meas- 
ures will be taken to check this practice.' 

Mehmed 'Ali, Pasha of Egypt, was now 
together with his son Ibrahim, in revolt against 
his suzerain ; and Vondiziano continues in the 
same despatch : 

* You will have heard that the expedition of 
the Viceroy of Egypt has at last moved toward 
the coast of Syria. Ibrahim Pasha is before Acre ; 
and has announced to the rebel Satrap the 
surrender of the town. It seems that the town 
wishes to resist, but it will be obliged to surrender 
to superior forces. 

^ Jaffa, Haifa, and Jerusalem are in the hands 
of the conqueror ; and the other ports of the 
Syrian coast have made their submission. In 
Damascus the revolution is in full swing. . . .' 

At the beginning of the following year the 
Porte made up its mind publicly to denounce 
Mehmed 'Ali and Ibrahim as rebels, and to 
deprive them of their offices. On May 4, 1832, 
the Reis Eflendi informs Stratford Canning that 
the Porte requests the subjects of all Friendly 
Powers to abstain from acts likelv to assist the 
outlaws. ^ His Majesty the Grand Signor' (I), 
he adds, ^ has been pleased to confer the Govern- 
ments' of Jeddah, of Egypt, and of Candia on 
Sirdar Ekrem of Natolia ; the Firmans containing 
the sentence of death on the rebels Mehmet Ali 
and his son Ibrahim have been published in all 
places.' In the struggle between the Sultan and 
his ambitious vassal, which was not definitely at 
an end until 1841, the fate of Cyprus was for a 
time involved. The quotation that follows is. 




THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 171 

from Engel, whose book/ published in 1841, has 
already been referred to : 

* When the Ptolemys wanted to found in Egypt 
a first-class state, the possession of Syria and 
Cyprus was an indispensable condition. To this 
end 3trove the Arabian conquerors of Egypt ; 
and Mohammad Ali, the founder of the latest 
Egyptian kingdom, holds the possession of these 
countries also a necessity, without which he cannot 
assure the independence and stability of his 
realm. Without these countries Egypt cannot 
have a fleet : without a fleet it is continually open 
to attack. . . . Mohammad Ali could not be 
content to found in Egypt a subordinate state, 
and insisted, after his victories over the Porte in 
the summer of 1832, on including in the conditions 
of peace the cession of Egypt, Syria, Crete and 
Cyprus as well. But the Porte offered to leave 
the two islands in pawn to England as the price 
of negotiating peace.^ England, indeed, declined 
to intervene, but the Viceroy of Egypt was never- 
theless obliged, in the peace concluded through 
the mediation of Russia on May 5, 1833, to 
abandon his claims on Cyprus, though he kept 
Crete. An exchange might have suited him 
better, but he was perhaps satisfied with the hope 
that the possession of Cyprus also could not much 
longer escape him, and at a cheaper price.' *

* Also as security for a loan desired by the Porte. Mytilene, 
too, was included in the offer, for the details of which cf. Ross, 
of, cit., p. 6j, ^ Excerfta, p. 462.

And Cobham adds : 

^ While Engel was still writing, the Sublime 
Porte was preparing a fresh surprise for the long- 
suffering Cypriots. Lord Malmesbury {Memoirs^ 
i., 125) under date of October 5, 1840, writes : 
" It is reported that the terms oflFered by the 
Sultan to the leaders of Mehemet Ali are as follows : 
To Soliman Pasha (Colonel Seves) and his son 
the island of Cyprus for inheritance as a Pashalik ; 
to Mahmoud Pasha the Pashalik of Tripoli . . . 
but that they have all refused, and acquainted 
Mehemet with the proposals made to them." ' * 

« 

Towards the end of the decade the energies 

which Mahmud II, despite the ceaseless dis- 
turbances of his reign, devoted to the reform of 
the internal administration of the Empire began to 
bear fruit in Cyprus. In 1 837 Mahmud granted to 
a deputation sent to the capital by the Archbishop, 
Panaretos, a decree fixing the total annual tribute 
of the island, exclusive of local expenses and the 
pay of certain officials, at 3,179,082 piastres.* 
In 1838 he issued a Firman establishing an uniform 
system of provincial government. Mahmud died 
on July I, 1839; but his son, 'Abdu'l Mejid, 
continued his work by the promulgation, on 
i November 3 of the same year, of the Khatt-i- 

Sherif (lit. August Rescript) of Giil-Khane, 
otherwise known as the Tanzimat, a charter

which guaranteed the lives and property of all 
Ottoman subjects, irrespective of race or religion, 
and regulated the incidence and collection of the 
taxes. As regards Cyprus, the practice of leasing 
the island to the highest bidder was abolished, 
and a salaried governor was appointed instead/ 
The Governor of Cyprus, whose emoluments 
were now fixed at 1 20,000 piastres per annum,* 
received tfie title of Qaimaqam, and a Council, 
known as the Divan, was formed to assist him. 
The Divan at first comprised eight members 
besides the Qaimaqam, namely four Turkish 
officials, the Archbishop, an elder of the Orthodox 
community, and representatives of the Armenians 
and the Maronites. Its membership was sub- 
sequently increased to thirteen.' With justice 
does Engel remark : * Among the important 
innovations introduced in the last few years 
into the Ottoman Empire with a view of main- 
taining its integrity, and especially among those 
which it owes to the activity and intelligence 
of Rashid Pasha, we must mention a reorganiza- 
tion of Cyprus.' * 

Among the signs of the times was the institu- 
tion at Larnaca of a Sanitary Department for 
Cyprus, under the direction of a Frenchman, 
Dr. Michaud. The Department furnished 
regular weekly bulletins, and generally seemed

active and energetic in dealing with Quarantine 
regxdations, an important matter in the Eastern 
Mediterranean. 

The central Government began, moreover, to 
exercise closer control over its local representatives, 
as is shown by the following communication from 
the Grand Vizier to the Governor of Cyprus (T^ : 

' Some time ago you complained » that the 
English merchants in Cyprus were not paying 
the nine per cent, on merchandise which they 
exported. Thereupon the English Ambassador 
asked for a report on the matter from the British 
Consul in Cyprus, who replied that the English 
merchants are only called upon to pay an export 
duty of three per cent, on goods purchased at 
a Port that have already paid import duty. 

' His Excellency the English Ambassador, hav- 
ing brought this reply to the notice of the Porte 
by means of a Diplomatic Note (Takrir), has 
asked that the Porte may direct that the stipula- 
tions of the commercial Convention ' be executed

' Indeed, it is not permissible to exact from the 
aglish merchants dues which the treaty does not 
tthorize. You will therefore demand from 
lem on goods bought in a Port, which have 
ready paid import duty, no more than an export 
ity of three per cent., in accordance with the 
riff. You will further take care not to hinder 
le English merchants in this respect, and to 
oid all further cause for complaint. That is 
' Concluded in 1838.

The flag in question, azure a cross potent 
between four crosses crosslet gules, was inherited 
by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, together 
with other privileges, from the mediaeval Cusios 
Terrae Sanctae, whose successor he was considered' 
to be, the Ottoman Government expressly recog- 
nizing his right to maintain a merchant marine.' 
Owing to the French Protectorate over the 
exercise of the Latin rite in the Levant, the 
French Consul would naturally be concerned in 
any question as to the misuse. of the Patriarchal 
ensign, which continued in use among Cypriote 
caiques owned by Latins until the early days of^

Consul, de vouloir bien assister k cette triste 



ceremome. 



In 1843 Dr. Lilburn died, and was succeeded 
by Mr. Niven Kerr. 

After the capture of Famagusta by the Turks in 
1571, this celebrated fortress, even now one of 
the finest examples of mediaeval military architec- 
ture that survive, fell rapidly from its previous 
splendour. The fortifications remained, and still 
remain, intact ; but the city within the walls, 
which once rivalled Venice in wealth and magnifi- 
cence, dwindled to the coixdition of a Turkish 
village, from which the Gothic churches, one 
for every day of the year, reared their delicate^ 
arches and their slender shafts. 

In view. of Famagusta's distinguished p^st and 
historical importance, a report on its condition 
in 1843, written by the British Consular Agent,; 
Brunohi, for the information of the new Consul 
at Larnaca, is of some interest: 

* Famagusta, 
' November 20, 1843 (I). 
^SlR, 

* I have the honour to forward to you a 
description of the present state of the city and 
harbour of Famagusta. 

^ The city of Famagusta is the principal fortress 
of the island of Cyprus, and of the present Otto- 
man dominions, notwithstanding its neglected 
condition and its partial abandonment. 



i8o THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

^ Its harbour, the only one, is the best of the 
thirty-six anchorages on the coasts of the said 
island, although choked with mud and ill-kept. . 

* This city was once celebrated for the countless 
assaults of the enemy which it withstood, but it 
is now inhabited by a miserable population of 
500 Turks of both sexes. The town is small, long 
rather than circular, with strong walls built on 
the solid rock, many bastions and counter-scarps 
which are in bad condition. The deep fosse 
still exists around the town, excavated from rock 
partly hard, partly sandstone ; it was made in 
olden days by the Venetians, who had not time, 
however, to complete it by connecting it with the 
sea. There are also outer walls around the moat. 
At the present day two town gates are in iise,. 
one on the land side with a draw- bridge, the 
other at the harbour. There are two forts, 
one, on the land side, facing the gardens of 
Marashia (Varosha), the other, the bigger one, 
on the sea side ; the latter is a regular citadel, 
surrounded by the water of the sea, which enters 
by a canal under the walls and is crossed by a 
bridge. This citadel not only defends the har- 
bour, but, if necessary, could also command the 
town. Although now in bad repair, lacking 
cannon, ammunition, supplies, and troops to 
defend it in case of a surprise attack, Famagusta 
could readily be rendered strong and impregnable 
by a European Power. 

* Its harbour, although not large, wgtdd be 
capable of accon\modating a number of men-of- 
war and merchantmen, were it dredged and put 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES i8i 

in repair. At present only small vessels enter 
the harbour, and occasionally large ones if entipty. 
The depth of water at the entrance, and in some 
parts of the harbour itself, is not more than 
12 or 12^ Venetian feet. In the anchorage 
outside the harbour is a reef, of which vessels 
entering must beware. 

* On the city walls and in the forts only very 
few cannon of heavy calibre remain; such as 
there are date from Venetian times and are for 
the most part useless. 

* The town has more than three hundred 
churches, of which the majority are now ruinous. 
The most important are S. Sophia and S. Nicholas, 
which' are in good condition. The ruined Royal 
Palace, the great Square of S. Sophia, and many 
other edifices dating from the glorious days of 
Christian rule, bear testimony to the bygone 
splendour and riches of Famagusta. 

* There are a Civil Vice-Governor, a Qadi or 
Justice of the Peace, a Commandant of the Place, 
and a Commandant of the troops, consisting of 
200 artillery-men. 

* Formerly the garrison consisted of a thousand 
Sipahis, not including the Timariots, who lived 
on the tithes of the villages granted to them 
ab antiquo by the Porte, and who were obliged in 
time of war to come into the town and take part 
in its defence. 

The Governor of Famagusta is paid a salary 
of 500 piastres Turkish a month from the public 
Treasury, and also enjoys certain other emolu- 
ments. His jurisdiction extends over 8 villages 



1 82 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

of the District of Famagusta, and over 37 
villages of the District of the Karpass where he 
has an Agent. 

* The Qadi or Judge has no fixed salary, but 
receives Court fees and other fees customary 
among the Turks, which he shares with the Grand 
Qadi of Nicosia. His jurisdiction extends like- 
wise over the Districts of the Karpass and Fama- 
gusta. 

 The Commandant of artillery and the Com- 
mandant of the Place have jurisdiction over 
their troops, who are scattered over the Dis- 
tricts of the Mesaoria, the Karpass, and Fama- 
gusta. 

The suburbs of the citadel are known as Mara- 
shia, and are thickly populated. The inhabitants 
are rich, and derive their wealth from the countless 
gardens which are irrigated by sweet well-water, 
and from their potteries. In the potteries they 
produce earthenware, made of a certain whitish- 
yellow clay, which has a large sale within the 
island and on the neighbouring coasts. 

* The bulk of the madder root of Cyprus comes 
from the lands around Famagusta and the sur- 
rounding villages. There is abundance of onions,- 
melons, cucumbers, pomegranates and every 
kind of fruit, which are sent inland and also 
exported from the island. 

* If the harbour were dredged and the city 
restored, then the cereals of the Mesaoria and 
its neighbourhood, its abundance of yellow and 
white silk, its cotton, wool, liquorice, sesame, 
barley, beans, vetches, and other products would 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 183 

render life in Famagusta most pleasant, would 
enrich the commercial houses and the public 
Treasury, and would greatly benefit the coasts 
of Syria and Karamania.

A letter to the Consul from the Bishop of 
Gibraltar discusses what was probably the first 
proposal for an English school in Cyprus : 

•  

* Cairo, 
* January 4, 1845. 

- ^ My dear Sir, 

* Your letter on behalf of the Education 
of the Greek population of Cyprus reached me 
before I left Malta, but I was prevented from 
answering it immediately partly by pressure 
of business and partly from the difficulty which 
I feel in answering it as I wish. I will most 
readily use my influence with one or two of the 
societies in London, but in the present state of 
their operations with regard to the Mediter- 
ranean I fear I shall find some difficulty in in- 
ducing them to afford assistance. The only way 
in which it seems likely that they might be pre- 
vailed upon to act, would be to establish a School 
or Schools upon the same principles as those 
which have been established for the Greeks at 
Syra by Mr. Hildner of the Church Missionary
Society. 

^ He has now carried on those Schools (contain- 
ing about 600 children) for several years without 
any complaint of proselytism, and when I was 
at Syra the Greek Bishop expressed his obligation 
for the education which they were giving to his 
people, 

* If these are the kind of Schools which you 
think would be acceptable at Cyprus I will do my 
best to induce that Society to establish one or 
more. But I am sure that it would be made 
a nepessary condition that the School should 
be placed under English Direction, On this 
point perhaps I may have misunderstood your 
views. 

* I shall therefore be glad to hear from you 
again on my return to Malta, which will be in 
about five or six weeks. 

^ Believe me, dear Sir, 

* Yours faithfully, 

^ G. Gibraltar.' 

In the remarkable correspondence which follows 
will be found a tale truly typical of Levantine 
life, as it has not ceased to be even now. The 
statements of the monk Nicodemus and of the 
Patriarch of Antioch were forwarded by the 
British Consul at Beirut to the Consul in Cyprus, 
accompanied by a letter which will bcj quoted at 
the end of the correspondence. 

The letter of the monk Nicodemus is its follows ; 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 185 

* Beirut, 
' October 19, 1846. (I) 

* To Her Britannic Majesty's Consul at Beirut. 

^Illustrious Sir, 

* I, the respectfully undersigned Nico- 
demus Pilarino, Ionian subject, have the honour 
humbly to represent as follows : 

* From the attached certificate of baptism, 
recognized by divers Consular Authorities, you 
will see that I am a native of Cephalonia, and 
that my name was Nicholas Pilarino. From my 
icarliest youth a sailor, in due course I became 
a Captain, and for a long time commanded a 
vessel of my own. Having conceived, however, 
a distaste for a calling so fiill of perils, I had long 
decided upon abandoning it for ever in order 
to spend the remainder of my life in peace and 
tranquillity. Thus chancing to find myself in 
the island of Cyprus, having with me my whole 
fortune of more than thirty thousand piastres, 
the price of my vessel and of my other property, 
I proceeded straightway to the monastery of 
Cyprus dedicated to the Virgin of Kykkos,* 
where I made my profession and became a monk 
under the name of Nicodemus. Both the Abbot 
as well as the other brethren of this monastery 
knew that I possessed money, for at their request 
I gave to the monastery a certain sum, keeping 

^ A piastre at this time was worth about id, 

* The monastery of Kykkos, in the Paphos Mountains, b 
the principal monastery in the island. It was founded about 
lioo. 

he rest for my own needs. After I had dwelt 
in the monastery for some time, the Abbot 
despatched me on several journeys into. Asia on 
the business of the convent, and later transferred 
me to Tripoli in Syria in order to watch over its 
interests in those parts. 

* On this voyage from the monastery to Tripoli, 
where I was to remain for a long time, I took my 
money with me, so that it might serve me in all 
circumstances. For seven years I 'dwelt in the 
town of Tripoli, and in that time I was able to 
collect and remit to the monastery a sum of sixty 
thousand piastres, as may be seen from my book 
and from the receipts in my hands. But as 
regards my private fortune, which I had with me, 
since I feared that it might be stolen, I deter- 
mined to ' render it safe ; and therefore, four 
years ago, I bought with it a house in Tripoli, 
which I caused to be repaired, arranged, and 
enlarged. 

* According to the bills, the house cost me in 
all more than twenty-five thousand piastres. 
I lived in one of the rooms, and let the remainder, 
whereby I barely covered my expenses. While 
I was living quietly in this manner, peacefully 
and harmlessly, as befitted a churchman, suddenly 
and without cause there arose against me His 
Holiness the Patriarch of Antioch and his suffra- 
gan, the Bishop of Tripoli, who commanded me 
to leave Tripoli and abandon my house, and to 
return to my monastery of Kykkos. And for the 
last two years the said prelates have prevented me 
from working either for myself or for the mojaasr 
ery, to the considerable detriment of the 
latter. 

^ I have therefore, as an Ionian subject, come 
here to solicit your protection against the wrong 
which His Holiness the Patriarch and his Bishop 
are doing me in compelling me to abandon and 
lose my house in Tripoli, bought and restored 
with the money earned by the sweat of my brow 
amid the perils of the sea. I am a poor monk, 
having nothing in this world except my house 
to keep me in my old age and to support me in 
case of sickness. 

* If His Holiness the Patriarch and his Bishop 
insist on my leaving Tripoli, I am ready to go 
and to withdraw to my monastery ; but in that 
case, on the grounds of law and of justice I ask 
that, they should either pay me the value of my 
house, amounting to twenty-five thousand pias- 
tres, or should allow me to stay in Tripoli until I 
have found a purchaser at that sum, on which I 
could live in my monastery. I believe, Illustrious 
Sir, thalt this is a reasonable request, and I am 
sure that you will not abandon a poor Ionian sub- 
ject to be the victim of injustice and persecution. 
- * I humbly beg you, therefore, to request your 
worthy Consular Agent in Tripoli, Mr. Catziflis, 
to lend me his help and protection, and to make 
the Patriarch and his Bishop to see the justice 
of my cause. ... 

, * I have the honour to be, 

* With prof ound -respect, 

, ' Youi: humble and devoted servant, 

, 'N. PiLARINO.' 



The Patriarch's version, as given to the Consul, 
is as follows : 


Beirut, 
February 2, 1847 (G), 

Sir, 

* We have received your letter by the monk 
Nicodemus Pilarino, and understand all that you 
are pleased to say about his claim. 

^ In consequence of the verbal communicatioil 
which, through your Interpreter, you had mad^ 
to us respecting this monk, and in order to con- 
firm the friendship existing between us and your- 
self, we have done everything in our power to 
effect a suitable arrangement for him, that he 
may return to his monastery and perform his 
duty by obeying or submitting to the discipline 
of the Order and of his superiors. 

* For these reasons we held a meeting of the 
clergy and Notables of our nation (at Beirut), 
in order to discuss and settle the affair of the 
monk in question, who was present at the meeting. 
We asked him about the house at Tripoli ; he 
replied that the house was his, he having bought 
it with his own money. Those present at the 
meeting then stated that the house was the 
property of the monastery, having been bought 
with the money which the monk Nicodemus had 
collected from the charity of the Christians ; 
and that it was not, therefore, his own property, 
as he pretended, and that he was not a merchant, 
who could gain money and thereby buy property. 
They observed, also, that when he bought the 
house in question he paid a part of the price in 
ready money, which he had collected, and that 
the other part was paid afterwards from the same 
money. 

* The monk Nicodemus then replied that what 
the members had said was perfectly true ; but 
that he was now without money and could not 
return to his monastery in Cyprus. 

* On learning this I, for the sake of Your 
Seigneury's friendship, ordered the Wakil (trustee) 
of the monastery to pay him 4,500 piastres for 
his travelling and other expenses. The monk 
consented to this arrangement and agreed to 
receive the money and to consign to the Wakil 
the Ho jet (title-deeds) of the house and the other 
papers belonging to the monastery. Thereupon 
the monk Nicodemus kissed our hands in the 
presence of the members of the meeting, and we 
ordered the Wakil to borrow the sum of Prs. 
4,500, to pay it to the plaintiff, to enable him to 
go to his monastery, and be replaced by the newly 
appointed monk. 

* The next day the money was ready, and yester-- 
day we sent him a notice to come and receive 
the same, and consign the Ho jet and other papers 
to the monk who has been appointed to fill his 
place. He refused to come, alleging that he had 
nothing to do with us ; we sent for him a second 
time ; he answered as before ; we then sent

last he came to us. There were at our house our 
Brothers the Bishops and several notables of the 
communion. We told him that the money was 
ready, and that he ought to receive it and tf aasfer' 
the title-deeds of the house in question and atheri 
papers, and then proceed to his mondsteryl^

a rebellious man, disobedient to his -Patriarchy

nothing to him which might hurt his feelings. 

* We beg leave to request that you will send to

Here is the comment made on the affair by 
the Consul in Beirut, in sending the papers to 
the Consul in Cyprus : 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 191 

' ' Beyrout, 

^ March 8, 1847. 

* My dear Sir, 

* The bearer of the present, Nicodemus 
Pilarino, a Greek monk, an Ionian subject, pre- 
sented a memorial to Colonel Rose * in October 
last, of which I enclose a copy for your informa-. 
tion, . as well as of the reply of the Greek Patriarch 
to a letter addressed to him by Colonel Rose on 
the subject of the monk's claim. 

* Both Colonel Rose and myself were of opinion 
that as the immediate Superiors of the monk 
Nicodemus reside at Cyprus, and as, in fact, the 
Greek Patriarch in Syria has no authority over 
the religious establishments at that Island, the 
proper course to be pursued in the matter was 
that Nicodemus should go to Cyprus, where his 
claim might be investigated. 

* Allow me, therefore, to recommend his case 
to your kind attention. It, certainly, does seem 
extraordinary to me that the Ecclesiastical 
Authority here should have offered him four- 
thousand five hundred piastres if all the money 
with which he purchased the house at Tripoli 
had been collected in the name of his Convent.' 

, On September 17, 1847, Pietro Loiso, British 
Consular Agent at Limasolj reports the arrival 
at that port of two Egyptian men-of-war, convey- 
ing Mehmed 'Ali, the Viceroy, on a visit of 
pleasure to the island he had hoped at one time 
to possess.

In somewhat curious juxtaposition are the two 
documents next in order. In the first, which 
is dated November 30, 1847, Consul Kerr is 
invited to attend at the Catholic Church in 
Larnaca a Te Deum in honour of Pope Pius IX, 
the ceremony being followed hy fireworks ; in, 
the second, of June 30, 1848, the Sardinian^ 
Consul informs his British colleague that he has 
* received orders from his Government to sub- 
stitute for the blue flag the Italian tricolor, 
symbol of unity and independence for which 
Charles Albert of Savoy is now fighting on the 
fields of Lombardy.' 

The relations between the Governor of Cyprus 
and the British Consular representative were 
generally friendly, and even cordial, as may be 
seen from these letters, written by the Pasha 
to Consul Kerr in 1 848 : 

* Most Illustrious Friend, (G) 

^ We are infinitely grateful to you for 
having informed us of the act of the Molla of 
this town, who accepted a female apostate from 
Christianity without our knowledge and without 
presenting her, according to the Imperial intent, 
first to us and afterwards to the Council. This 
could only be done when, in the presence of the 
primates of her nation, the necessary questions 
had been put to her, and she then voluntarily 
embraced Islam. 

* This step on the part of the Molla has caused 
us no small degree of dissatisfaction ; it must be 
attributed, however, to his fanatical sentiments. 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 193 

We shall not fail to make the necessary observa* 
tions on this subject to him, that in future he may 
not do things contrary to the orders of the Sultan. 

* With the expression of our particular and 
cordial friendship and love, we remain, 

* The Governor of Cyprus, 

* Isma'il Adil Pasha. 

* Seraglio (Satrapeion) of Nicosia,

* Most Illustrious and Revered Friend, (G) 

^ I received with unutterable joy your 
friendly letter, and saw, to my soul's delight, 
what you had written in my favour to your 
August Embassy, a copy of the answer to which 
I found enclosed. This is a striking proof of 
your peculiar friendship and love towards me, 
for which I offer you the tribute of my inexpres- 
sible gratitude. I beg also that you will be 
pleased to convey to your August Embassy my 
copious respects and the expression of my un- 
bounded gratitude. 

' I avail myself of this opportunity to confirm 
to you the most distinguished feelings of my 
high consideration.

Embassy to the effect that all slaves in the posses- 
sion of British subjects in the Levant were hence- 
forth free, and that in future any British subject in 
Turkey trafficking in slaves would render himself 
Uable, under the provisions of 6 & 7 Victoria, 
cap. 98, to be sent to Malta for trial. 

The legal procedure to be adopted in the 
Consular Courts with regard to Ionian subjects 
is set forth in a despatch from the Britbh Consul 
in ^Jiodes to the Vice-Consul at Larnaca, Cyprus 
having become a Vice-Consulate subordinate 
to Rhodes in 1849 :

A despatch from Rhodes to the Vice-Consul, 
of August 24, 1852, refers to an issue of revolu- 
tionary paper money in Sicily : 

^ A la suite de la demande que le Prince Carini, 
Ministre Napolitain pres de la Cour de Londres, 
a faite au Comte Malmesbury, Ministre des 
Affaires Etrangeres, je vous previens que le 
papier- monnaie, ou assignats nommes " Aliquoti " 
mis en circulation pendant la Revolution de 
Sicile, n'est pas reconnu par le Gouvernement 
Napolitain, et je dois vous inviter de donner a ce 
fait la publicite que vous croirez necessaire dans 
votre jurisdiction Vice-Consulaire.' 

In. 185 3 the name of Lady Hester Stanhope 
appears once more, and for the last time, in these 
papers, in the melancholy connexion of a meeting 
of her many creditors held in Beirut after her 
death. 

The Russo-Turkish conflict of 1854, which 
developed into the Crimean War, had serioue 
results in Greece. King Otho and Queen 
Amalia, who, it has been said, loved their adopted 
country not always wisely, but too well, considered 
that the time had come for the incorporation of ^ 
Epirus and Thessaly within the Greek Kingdom. t 
Revolutionary bands of Greek * Antartis ' on 
the Turkish frontier were financed from Athens 
and led by ofiicers of the Greek Army who re- 
signed their Commissions for the purpose ; while 1 
Otho broke off diplomatic relations with the 
Sultan, and would have gone to war but for the 
occupation of the Piraeus by Great Britain and 
France from 1854 until 1857. Throughout the 
negotiations preceding the war Stratford Canning, 
who had now become Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, \ 
provided Turkish statesmen with the necessary 
^ stiffening,' and in the following circular, ad- \ 
dressed to his Consuls, the ^ Great Elchi ' gave . 
formal denial to certain rumours which had been I 

circulated by the war party in Greece : j

Even Cyprus was to some extent involved in 
the general ferment, for early in 1854 there was 
issued in Athens an anonymous pamphlet urging 
the Orthodox subjects of the Porte to rebellion, 
which was reputed to have been written by one 
Francoudes, then head master of the High School 
in Nicosia and a resident in the Archbishop's 
palace.^ The authorship of the pamphlet was 
never proved, but the suspicions of the leading 
Turks in Cyprus were aroused against the Chris- 
tians, and there was talk of their being disarmed* 

^ cf. Hackett, p. 23^^. 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 199 

On February 24, 1854, the Governor of Cyprus 
wrote to the British Vice-Consul (T) : 

^ I beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of 
your letter concerning a small pamphlet contain- 
ing treasonable matter, which was handed to me 
by Mr. Laffon, and which you desire to have 
sent to you, as well as of your kind expressions of 
friendship. It is needless to say that this is but 
another proof of the strong bonds of friendship 
which unite our two countries. The pamphlet 
in question was handed to me some days ago by 
Mr. Laflfon, an action most creditable to that 
gentleman. I must state that the pamphlet con- 
tains some very inflammable matter, the publica- 
tion of which might cause trouble both now and 
in the future. Whoever published it should be 
punished. As this question might lead to trouble 
and misunderstanding among the people, as a 
measure of precaution I at once summoned a 
meeting of the principal Moslems and Christians, 
the officials and members of the Administrative 
Council, and placed the whole matter before 
them. After grave deliberations it was arranged 
that by the instrumentality of the Archbishop the 
pamphlets should be collected, and they have now 
been handed over to me, and private and public 
investigations are taking place. I am sending 
one copy of the pamphlet by the first mail steamer 
to His Excellency the Vali of the Archipelago, 
and another copy herewith to you. A third copy 
has been handed to Mr. Laflfon for the French 
Consul, The Mudir of Tuzla (Larnaca) has 



200 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

been instructed to make private and public 
investigations concerning the publisher of the 
pamphlet, and I venture to beg you and the 
French Consul to render all assistance possible. 
^ The Governor of the Island of Cyprus, 

^Mehmed Sherif.' 

On April 2 the Consul in Rhodes wrote to the 
Vice-Consul at Larnaca : 

^ J'ai Phonneur de vous informer que j'ai 
transmis k Son Excellence PAmbassadeur a Con- 
stantinople une copie de votre office No. 8 en 
date 7 du mois passe relativement k la distribution 
des brochures en langue Grecque que derniere- 
ment a eu lieu k Cypfe. 

^ Son Excellence Ismail Pasha, Gouverneur 
General de PArchipel, m'a inf orme que le Pasha de 
Cypre ne lui ecrit rien au sujet du disarmement 
des Chretiens residents dans cette ile, et que 
telle mesure ne pent pas avoir lieu sans que les 
Autorites locales soient ad hoc autorisees par la 
Sublime Porte de la mettre en execution.' 

A canard published at about this time in Greece 
to the effect that Austria and Prussia were con- 
templating an alliance with Russia against Eng- 
land, Turkey, and France provoked, on April 9, 
a further letter from the Pasha to the Vice-Consul 
(T): 

^ I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 
concerning the announcement made by certain 
persons of a so-called alliance concluded by Aus-

tria and Prussia with Russia to combat Turkey, 
England, and France, the incorrectness of this 
announcement, and the copy of an article from 
the Athenian Press together with some observa- 
tions on your part. The article from the Press 
clearly shows the falseness of the announcement, 
and I should certainly attach no importance to it, 
but I am much obliged to you for your kindness in 
pointing it out to me. In a special letter from 
the Mudir of Tuzla I have been informed that 
the Swedish Consul brought to light this false 
piece of news, and I have been asked whether he 
should be pressed for details. I have to-day sent 
to the Mudir an official letter for the Swedish 
Consul, asking where this news came from, in 
what paper it was written, and how he obtained 
the information. On receiving an answer I will 
at once inform you of its purport.

'Mehmed Sherif.' 

On October 2, 1855, the Pasha writes to the 
Vice-Consul to inform him that he has com- 
manded three days of illumination and feasting 
to celebrate the capture of Sebastopol. 

In a despatch dated November 24 of the same 
year, the Consul in Rhodes desires the Cyprus 
Consulate to make inquiry into the landing at 
Larnaca of a number of black female slaves, 
rumours of which had recently reached him, and 
to ascertain * if the Consular Agent of Prussia 
is he who furnishes the capital for this shameful 
commerce/ 



202 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

On April 7, 1856^ the French Consul invites 
his colleagues to attend a Te Deum ^ en action 
de grace de Pheureuse delivrance de Sa Majeste 
PImperatrice Eugenie, qui a donne k la France 
un Prince Imperial.' 

In a despatch of April 26, 1856, the Consul in 
Rhodes transmitted to Cyprus copies of two 
important documents. The first was the Khatt- 
i-Humayun (^ Illustrious Rescript '), issued by 
'Abdu'l Mejid on February 18 ; the second, the 
Treaty of Paris, signed on March 30. The two 
documents are not without relation to one another; 
for article 9 of the Treaty, which aimed at 
settling the issues raised by the Crimean War, 
declared that the Powers were so strongly im- 
pressed by ^ the high value of this communica- 
tion ' {sc. the Khatt-i-Humayun) that they 
disclaimed the right to intervene between the 
Sultan and his subjects. 

A translation of the text of the Khatt-i-Huma- 
yun was laid before Parliament in 1856, and 
illustrates the theoretical excellence of Turkish 
edicts and laws. Its primary object was to con- 
firm the provisions of the Khatt-i-Sherif of Giil- 
Khane, a charter that had long ceased to be 
respected ; but as regards the majority of its 
enactments, it was put into practice almost as 
little as its predecessor. One of the abuses 
abolished by the Khatt-i-SherJf of Giil-Khane 
in 1839 was the farming of taxes ; in 1841 that 
system was avowedly reintroduced. In 1856, 
tax-farming was again disavowed in theory, 
but largely maintained in practice. It is well 
to remember, however, that the opposition to 
the abolition of tax- farming, both in 1839 and 
1856, came from the Christian sarrafsj or money- 
changers, of Constantinople ;  and that the 
system is still considered by many European 
economists to be that best suited at all events 
as regards the tithe, to certain portions of the 
Ottoman Empire. Further the Khatt, in the 
words of Turkey in Europe^ * proclaimed perfect 
toleration and the absolute equality of all reli- 
gions, and enumerated a whole catalogue of 
reforms, administrative, financial, ecclesiastical, 
and judicial. Many of these, however, came into 
collision with Greek interests, notably the pro- 
visions which assigned fixed stipends to the 
clergy instead of allowing them to take what 
dues they could from their flocks. It is said that 
when the Archbishop of Ismidt, after hearing the 
imperial rescript read, saw it replaced in its silken 
envelope, he ejaculated, " Pray God that it may 
stay there !

The extent to which, in the opinion of the 
Ottoman Government, the Khatt was applied 
was indicated in a Memorandum furnished by 
{{wi:Fuad_Pasha}} to {{wi:Lord_Lyons}} in 1867, and sub- 
sequently laid before Parliament. 

In the year 1859 Sultan 'Abdu'l Mejid con- 
templated a tour of his dominions, which was to 
include a visit to Cyprus. On the occasion of 
this anticipated visit, the Orthodox population 
of the island prepared an address for presentation 

1 cf. Sir C. Eliot, Turkey in Eurofe, 2n4 edition, 19081 





to the Sultan, for the text of which I am indebted 
to the kindness of the present Archbishop of 
Cyprus, His Beatitude Kyrillos HI, and of his 
archivist, Mr. K. Myrianthopoulos. The document, which I translate in full, is the only direct 
communication between the Cypriote Christians 
and the Sultan which we have on record ; and 
it is instructive as illustrating the relations sub- 
sisting between them. When due allowance 
is made for the obsequiousness of diction which 
would be expected by the Sovereign from his 
subjects in a memorial of this kind, the Address 
does not disclose that the Christians of Cyprus 
were labouring under very serious misgovernment. 
With one exception, the grievances of the 
islanders have to do with agricultural pests, and 
in the case of the exception the memorialists 
are not intimidated from complaining against 
a harsh tax-gatherer. 

In the event, 'Abdu'l Mejid did not visit 
Cyprus, and the address was delivered to him in 
Constantinople through the Oecumenical Patri- 
arch, Kyrillos VII. The text is as follows (G) : 

<p style="white-space:pre">
Your Majesty ! 

Fortunate and thrice happy to-day is 
to be considered this island, which so gladly re- 
ceives her august Sovereign. 

 We, too, are happy and fortunate in being 
judged worthy of the favour of an Imperial 
visit, and in enjoying the sight of our most be- 
loved, most gracious, and most serene monarch. 
Thrilled with infinite joy and gratitude, we first 
return from the depths of our hearts and souls 
prayers and supplications to Almighty God to 
safeguard and protect your Imperial Majesty as 
the apple of His eye, to lavish on your Majesty 
many happy years, and to bring your Majesty 
auspiciously and safely back to the brilliant Queen 
of cities. 

Secondly, we humbly bow down before your 
sublime Majesty, and oifer, in the name of the 
whole island, our most humble devotion, expressing 
with the deepest respect our cordial faith and 
aflfection, and our gratitude for the royal boons 
which your Majesty has graciously bestowed on 
us as on the remainder of your Majesty's faithful 
subjects. 

The new regulations, salutary for the people,^ 
whic^i by your most philanthropic Majesty's 
subliine desire and intention have been promul- 
gated through the whole of the immense Empire 
for the weal of your Majesty's faithful subjects 
have also acted in this our fatherland in an 
advantageous manner, and have conferred many 
great benefits. 

* We confess, most august King, the favour, we 
declare the royal mercy, we loudly proclaim the 
beneficence ; for, if we kept silence, the very 
stones would cry out. 

* But our country, most merciful King, has 
painful wounds, wounds by which she is con- 
tinually scourged, from which she groans and 
suffers pain. She can hope to be cured of these 
wounds by none other, after God, but by her 

^ i.e. the Khatt-i-Humayun» 



2o6 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

powerful and most merciful King. And as we 
know that your Majesty not only rejoices at 
seeing the progress and prosperity of your sub- 
jects, but, like a celestial angel, pours healing 
balm on wounds and sores and accords kingly 
kindness to the sufferer, we therefore venture 
with anxious hearts to place our great suflPerings 
before your Majesty. 

* The principal and greatest evil of this country, 
your Majesty, is the locust, the accursed insect 
which from the earliest times has yearly laid the 
island desolate, and has caused myriads of poor 
people to grieve and to lament. Yearly it devours 
the fruit of our labour, devours the wheat and 
the barley and the vineyards, and oftentimes 
even the olive groves and every plant and tree. 
And owing to this havoc thousands of farmers 
are ruined and become destitute, while their 
laments and groans resound from one end of the 
island to the other. 

^ In vain have our central Council and the 
leaders of the people and the inhabitants striven 
year by year, and spent unsparingly, for its 
extermination. In vain have some of our 
Governors laboured, through the farmers and 
others, to destroy the monster, many times even 
oppressing the farmers thereby. The present 
administrator of the island, our dearly beloved 
Governor, has indeed striven, with the members 
of the Council and the leaders of the people, for 
the destruction of the locust in a more measured 
and considerate manner. Unfortunately, at the 
time when the locust campaign must of necessity 
be proceeded with, the farmers are engaged either 
in sowing their lands or with the harvest. And 
if they come out to destroy locusts, either the 
lands remain unsown or the crops that the locust 
has spared remain unreaped and ungathered. 

* Together with this great locust plague there 
has also appeared in our country for some years 
past, tormenting the uiffortunate inhabitants, 
the vine disease and the silkworm disease. And 
thus our condition has become so hard, pitiful, 
and miserable owing to these scourges, especially 
to the locust, that we have not the means to erect 
school buildings and to maintain decent and 
suitable educational establishments such as 
others, in other provinces under your Majesty's 
august sway, are happy to enjoy. 

* These matters, most merciful and beneficent 
King, we submit with tears in our eyes and with 
humble hearts to your most philanthropic Majesty, 
invoking your mercy, because none else on earth 
but a powerful kingly arm can exterminate the 
disastrous insect from the island and bring joy 
and happiness to thousands of people now in 
distress. 

^ Another misfortune now hangs over the island, 
that of the arrears of taxes. Five months ago 
an envoy from Constantinople arrived in Cyprus 
in order to collect and bring in the arrears of 
revenue, a reasonable and just thing. It is the 
duty of every faithful subject to pay conscien- 
tiously whatever he owes to the Imperial Treas- 
ury. But the hard, heavy, and unjust manner, 
inconsistent with his high instructions, with 



<!-page 2o8 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES --> 

which this envoy behaved, has brought many 
people into deep embarrassment. We. are quite 
willing, if need be, to give the necessary informa- 
tion in evidence of our just complaint against him, 

Yea, most excellent Monarch ! We have 
the firm conviction that your royal presence in 
our country will leave beneficial traces ; and this 
conviction is so deeply impressed upon us, that 
not only we, but the generations after us, will 
bless your Majesty's august name, and will with 
enthusiasm remember this blessed hour and day, 
on which your Majesty has been pleased to set 
foot on the soil of Cyprus. 

Long live his Majesty our most serene Em- 
peror and King ! Long live the most revered 
monarch. Sultan Abdul Mejid our master! 
May his glory and fame increase ! May the 
might of his beneficent Majesty be exalted by the 
All-Highest ! 

^ In Cyprus, the 22nd October, 1859.' 

</p>
In October 1861, the Vice-Consul had to 
complain to the Ambassador, Bulwer, of the 
inertia of Khairu'Uah Pasha, the Governor of 
Cyprus : 

* I have the honour to report to Your Excellency 
that Hairullah Pasha, the Governor of this 
Island, has of late neglected public business to 
such an extent as to cause great confusion in the 
administration and severe pecuniary losses and 
inconvenience to several of Her Majesty's sub- 
jects. 


' This Pasha is now in such an enfeebled state 
both of mind and body, owing to his dissipated 
habits, that he is utterly unfit for the important 
post he occupies, and unless speedily removed, 
the consequences are likely to be very serious, 
both Christians and Turks being equally dis- 
satisfied with his administration.' 

From a despatch addressed by the Vice-Consul 
to the Ambassador on November 18, 1861, it 
appears that a change in the Constitution of 
Cyprus took place in that year. By the change 
in question the island was withdrawn from the 
Pashalik of Rhodes and created an independent 
Mutessariflik under the immediate jurisdiction 
of the Porte, an arrangement which, as we shall 
see, was reversed in 1868, to be reverted to in 
1870. 

In December 1861, in consequence of this 
change, the Cyprus Vice-Consulate became in- 
dependent of the jurisdiction of the Consulate 
in Rhodes. 

The Vice-Consul's annual report for 1862 
contains the following interesting sketch of the 
Cypriote people : 

' The Cypriots are of a quiet and inoffensive 
disposition — they are sociable and hospitable, and 
remarkably fond of pleasure. But they are 
naturally lazy and given to idleness — they waste 
much of their time in their cafes and are great 
frequenters of the fairs which are held at short 
intervals in different parts of the island — they are 



2IO THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

frugal and temperate in their living, coarse 
bread, cheese, olives, and vegetables forming the 
ordinary food of the peasantry — ^yet owing to 
the abundance and cheapness of wine drunkenness 
is not uncommon amongst them. Brigandage, 
burglaries, and assassinations are so rare as to 
be almost unknown in Cyprus — political agitation 
or opposition on the part of the people to the 
constituted authority is equally unknown. The 
Christians are less false than Greeks are generally 
reputed to be — they are also less active and 
enterprising — yet they have a reputation in the 
Levant for cunning and keenness in business 
which is perhaps not altogether undeserved. 
The Musulmans have little of the fanatical spirit 
and bigotry which characterizes the Arab Musul- 
man — they live in harmony with their Christian 
neighbours in town and country — but at Nicosia 
where they form the majority of the population 
they are more inclined to assert their superiority.' 

In 1864 the Imperial Ottoman Bank established 
a brancji in Cyprus, this being the first appear- 
ance of a bank in the island. 

The following letter owes its interest not so 
much to its contents as to the identity of the 
writer, who was destined to become one of the 
most distinguished Turkish statesmen of modern 
times, and was throughout his long life an ardent 
friend of England. Mehmed Kiamil was a 
native of Nicosia, and perhaps the greatest 
Cypriote since Zeno of Citium, the Founder of 
the Stoics ; the tragic couf d^etat of January 23, 
^9^39 which brought about the fall of his last 
Ministry and the murder by Enver Bey of his War 
Minister, Nazim, at the Council table, is within 
recent memory. In May 191 3, Kiamil Pasha re- 
turned to Cyprus tp end his days in his beloved 
native island, and there died, at the age of 
eighty- two, •on November 14 of that year* :

Majesty the Sultan, as is customary, in all the

night preceding Sunday to the time of afternoon 
prayer on the following day, there will be fired 
five salvos on five successive occasions. Also 
those who are so disposed will illuminate their 
shops and house fronts to celebrate the happy 
occasion. On the following day, Sunday, the 
Members of the Administrative Council and

in all the Government centres of the Island and 
will present their felicitations. As a token of the 
bonds of friendship which unite the Ottoman 
Empire to your Country, I beg that you will be so 
good as to hoist the flag on your Consulate, and

^ To THE British Vice-Co nsul (T^, 

* In each of the towns of Nicosia, Tuzla, 
and Scala, coffee is pounded in only one place, 
and the tax on pounding is collected. As the 
result of the sale of the right of pounding, the 
tax was adjudged this year to Mehmed, son of 
Haji Ibrahim of Scala, for a total of Piastres 
4,200, and the auction ratified by the Governor. 
According to the terms of the sale, the pounding 
of coffee elsewhere is prohibited, and coflEee 
must be bought by the keepers of cafes from the 
official pounding house. It seems, however, that 
one of your subjects, named Michael Melikian, 
pounds his coffee in his own cafe, and the above 
farmer of the tax has sent us a petition on the 
subject. As his complaint appears well founded, 
and as in this way the revenue is being made to 
suffer, we beg you to see that the said Michael 
desists from this practice and buys his coffee 
ready pounded from the official pounding house. 
I take the occasion to renew my expressions of 
regard.

the principal destinations of the more favoured 
class of TurKsh exile, that is to say, of the Otto-. 
man officials who, while temporarily in disgrace, 
owing, perhaps, to the eclipse of their patrons 
at headquarters, were Ukely to be restored to 
favour at some later date. In the course of my 
travels in Turkey I have met at least two Valis 
who spent their early youth in Famagusta, where 
their fathers. Pashas of importance, had been 
exiled, and who looked back almost with affection 
on their place of banishment. At the British 
Occupation in 1878, there was found at Fama- 
gusta a number of political exiles, of whom the 
most interesting was the Babi leader Subh-i- 
Ezel, who survived until 191 2,* and among the 
Consular documents are many petitions from 
exiles, asking the British authorities to help 
them to obtain their release. The following 
is an example :

jurisdiction of the Consulate of Beirut. 

We now come to what is probably the most 
valuable and informative of the documents 
preserved among these archives. On March 6, 
1867, the Hou9e of Commons presented an 



2i6 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

Address to the Queen, praying * that there be laid 
before this House a copy of any papers or De- 
spatches from Her Majesty's Diplomatic or 
Consular Agents in any part of the Turkish Em- 
pire or of Greece, which show how the stipulations 
agreed on by the British Government and that 
of Turkey with regard to the Treatment of the 
Christian and of the Greek subjects of the Sultan 
have been observed.' In due course there was 
issued one of the most important of the Parlia- 
mentary Papers relating to Turkey, wherein are 
collected the twenty-six Consular reports pre- 
pared in compliance with the Address. The 
report of the Vice- Consul in Cyprus is as follows : 

* Larnaca, Cyprus, 

* Afril 15, 1867. 

' My Lord, 

* I have the honour to acknowledge the 
receipt of your Excellency's circular of the i6th 
ultimo (to which was subjoined a copy of an 
Address to Her Majesty from the House of 
Commons), requesting certain information rela- 
tive to the treatment of the Greek and other 
Christian subjects of the Sultan. 

* It is necessary to premise that out of a total 
population of 200,000 souls, which it is roughly cal- 
culated that this island contains, more than three- 
quarters are Christians professing the orthodox 
Greek faith, the remainder being Mussulmans. 
The former hold an inferior position to the 
itter in two important respects ; first, that in 
tie legal tribunals they are very inadequately 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 217 

represented ; and secondly, that, with two 
exceptions to be mentioned hereafter, their 
evidence is refused in all the tribunals when given 
against Mussulmans. 

^ It is to the composition of the Courts of 
Justice, indeed, that almost all the grievances of 
which the Christians have to complain may be 
traced, with the exception of those which they 
suffer in common with Mussulmans from the 
incapacity of the Government ; and on this 
account I think it important to give a brief 
description of the character and functions of 
these bodies. 

^ Each of the sixteen districts into which Cyprus 
is divided has its Medjlis or Municipal Council, 
which holds its sittings at the chief town of 
the, district, and consists of about six members. 
Taking that sitting at this town of Larnaca as 
a specimen of the rest, it is composed of four 
Mussulmans and two Christians, and is presided 
over by the Mudir or local Governor. The 
Mussulman members consist of the Cadi or Judge, 
who sits ex officio^ and three members representing 
the Mahometan population ; the two Christian 
members represent, and are elected by, their 
coreligionists. This Court tries both civil and 
criminal cases, and its decisions are given by the 
majority of votes, but Christian testimony is 
held inadmissible. 

* From these District Courts appeals are made 
to the Provincial Court, which holds its sittings 
at the capital, and which takes cognizance of 
jn^tters of ^n administrative or financial character 



2i8 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

connected with taxes, tithes, Customs duties, 
and such civil suits as do not immediately concern 
questions of inheritance, which fall within the 
domain of the Cadi's jurisdiction, or in the case of 
Christians are managed by their own ecclesiastics. 
Its constitution is framed with the same disregard 
to the interests it ought to represent and protect, 
as characterizes that of the minor Courts. It is 
composed of thirteen members, exclusive of the 
Pasha of Cyprus, who presides at its sittings ; 
and of these, nine are Mussulmans and four Chris- 
tians. Of the former, six sit in virtue of their 
office, viz. the Cadi, the Mufti, the Treasurer, 
the Administrator of Mortmain Property, the 
Administrator of Crown Lands, and the Public 
Registrar, while the remaining three represent 
the Mahometan inhabitants of the town. The 
four Christian members consist of the Archbishop 
of Cyprus, who sits ex officio^ and three others, who 
are elected by their fellow Christian townsmen ; 
but if any of them— and this remark applies 
equally to the three Mahometan members — 
have rendered themselves obnoxious to the 
Governor, he signifies his dissatisfaction with the 
choice, and others are substituted in their place. 
It is manifestly impossible, therefore, for any of 
the elected members to maintain an independent 
attitude by checking abuses, for he would thereby 
incur the displeasure of the Pasha and official 
Turkish. members, who collectively are as strong 
as the Pasha, and lose his seat. Their subservience 
to Government is further increased by the salaries 
which they draw — salaries contributed by the 

Christians for the payment of their delegates, 
but distributed by the Pasha. Thus, in the 
Council where questions affecting the most im- 
portant interests of the island are adjudicated, 
and which is the tribunal at which all appeals 
from inferior Courts are finally decided, there 
are nine members to represent less than one-fourth 
of the population and one-sixth of the property, 
and only four members to represent the remaining 
important majority, and over these a Mussulman 
functionary holding the highest rank in the 
island exercises the influence of his powerful 
authority. A just and capable Governor can 
often do much to mitigate the evils of the vicious 
system he is called on to administer ; an incapable 
one has it in his power to aggravate them. 

* It would not, however, be a fair conclusion 
to draw from the above descriptions of the 
provincial and sixteen district Councils that 
justice is always denied to Christians. The 
constitution of these Courts would certainly 
justify such a conclusion, especially as the rejec- 
tion of Christians' evidence is one of their 
fundamental laws. But it must not be forgotten 
that all their members are open to bribery, and 
the rich Christian suitor is often more than a 
match for his poor Mussulman adversary. The 
civil disabilities, too, under which the Christians 
lie are materially mitigated by the important 
circumstance that they are the wealthiest class 
in : the island, being the principal landowners, 
and, in trade, no less than in agriculture, possess 
a pre-eminence over the Mahomedans. Enjoying 



220 THE CONSUJLAR ARCHIVES 

thus the many advantages which accrue from the 
possession of superior wealth as well as intelligence, 
they are not unfrequently able to induce the 
local Councils to accept their evidence against 
Mahomedans. This is especially the case in 
places where the latter are few and poor, and 
dependent, it may be, on the Christians for their 
means of living. In such cases it may truly 
be said that the Christians get justice for them- 
selves, and in spite of the spirit of the institutions 
provided for that purpose by Government. It 
is in the capital, where the most important causes 
are heard, that they labour under the greatest 
disadvantages, for there alone is observable any 
spirit of Mussulman fanaticism, the rest of the 
country being singularly free from its baneful 
influence. The Mussulmans having there been 
long in the ascendancy, in the possession of 
considerable property, and their exclusive spirit 
kept alive by the presence of the Government, 
which is always more or less animated by jealousy 
of Christian influence, and the members of which 
are constantly recruited from Constantinople, 
a certain hostility to the Greek population displays 
itself, the more remarkable from its absence else- 
where. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, 
that the Med j lis which holds its sittings there 
should fairly represent the interests of all parties 
in the island, its members being chosen from its 
several districts, instead of, as at present, from the 
town itself, and provision should be particularly 
made that it is not overweighted by the presence of 
50 many as seven irremovable Turkish functionari^, 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 221 

'The two Courts where Christian evidence is 
received, to which reference was made above, are, 
first, the Med] lis el Tahkik, where the more 
important criminal and poKce cases are tried, 
the members of which are both Christians and 
Mussulmans, and which holds its sittings at 
Nicosia the capital of Cyprus ; and, secondly, 
the Mejlis el Tijaret, sitting at Larnaca where 
commercial suits are heard, the members of which 
consist of equal numbers of Europeans and natives, 
each important Consulate sending a delegate, 
and the natives being half Christian and half 
Mussulman, making a total of twelve. Thus 
fair guarantees of justice are afforded to the 
population of this commercial town, where, too, 
the several Consulates are able to watch the pro- 
ceedings of the Court. At the capital the Medjlis 
el Tahkik cannot adequately attend to the criminal 
jurisdiction of the whole island, the majority 
of cases being disposed of by the District Courts 
where Christian testimony is inadmissible. 

* Another grievance of which the Greeks have 
to complain is the unequal distribution of the 
personal tax called " verghi," of which they pay 
in most villages more than their fair share ; but 
this is an evil which would be quickly remedied 
could they make themselves heard in the Central 
Medjlis. 

* Though they have just cause then to complain 
of the inferior position which they hold in the 
eye of the law in the instances already mentioned, 
both Mussulmans and Christians have equal cause 
to be dissatisfied with the maladministration

ration in the condition of the prisons and prison 
discipline, while next to nothing has been done 
to render the common gaols fit receptacles for 
human beings, still less as a means of discipline 
for the different classes of criminals. 

^ Finally, the prospect held out by the Hatt, 
that certain sums should be devoted to public 
works, has not been realized. With a surplus 
revenue of 200,000 /. it might be expected that 
something would be done towards carrying out 
public works of utility. An abortive attempt 
was indeed made three or four years ago to con- 
struct a carriage-road between this port and the 
capital, a distance of but twenty-five miles. But 
instead of devoting any of the usual revenue of 
the island to this purpose, a tax was imposed on 
that part of the country which was to have 
benefited by the undertaking, and its labouring 
population forced to work gratuitously. After 
3,000 /. had been expended in the payment of 
salaries to an engineer and his staff and prelimin- 
ary expenses, at the end of a year the work came 
to a close, the only result being the cutting of a 
ditch for five miles on either side of the intended 
road. 

* The present Governor has since recommended 
the abandonment of the undertaking ; but 
travelling myself in that district only last week, 
I was surprised to find that Government still 
continued to collect the road tax, one village 
where I stayed having just paid 130 /. for that 
object. Many of the inhabitants being very poor, 
they offered to work without remuneration.

* 2. Jre there any special taxes peculiar to 
the district ? 

* 2. There are two taxes, or, at least, burdens 
on the people equivalent to taxes not included 
in the above list, which, if not peculiar to this 
Island, do not obtain throughout the Empire 
generally ; these are the locust tax and the road 
tax. 

^ First. The locust tax is an obligation laid 
on each peasant to collect every year thirty okes 
of locusts' eggs, locusts being a scourge fronr which 
the Island is never free. In those districts in 
which the eggs are abundant the tale of thirty okes 
of eggs will represent four days' labour ; in other 
districts where they are more sparsely laid, it 
will require ten days' labour to collect them ; while 
in those where they are not found at all, the 
peasantry are obliged to buy them from other 
parts of the country at a cost of two piastres an 
oke. It is generally estimated that this measure 
is a tax on each village of sixty piastres a year. 

* Second, The road tax was imposed in 1865 
for the purpose of making a carriage-road between 
the port of Larnaca and the capital, Nicosia. It 
was arranged that the villages living within a 
short distance from the line traced out for the 
road should contribute their labour gratis, while 
such as lived at a distance should pay a sum of 
money. ^^4,000 was collected towards this 
object the first year, but scarcely anything could 
be shown for such an expenditure. The whole 
plan has now been abandoned for upwards of 
a year by official instructions from Constantinople, 
but so late as last April money was being collected 
ostensibly for the above object, one village 
through which I happened to be then passing 
having just paid 130 Turkish pounds in the name 
of the road tax, not one farthing of which can 
have been applied to that purpose. 

* 3. // you have the re fort of Mr. Foster and 
Lord Hohart of December 7, 1861, give any 
comments which may suggest themselves on 
the same^ particularly in reference to taxes.

Hobart's Report does not exist in the Archives

* 4. What modifications have been effected since 

the date of that report of H.MJs Com- 
missioners ? 

* 4. The following modifications have been 
effected since the date of the report of H.M/s 
Commissioners : 

* (i) An increase of the tax on sheep and goats 
from twenty to sixty paras. 

* (2) An increase of the duty on salt from four 
paras the oke to one piastre. The latter duty 
now applies only to towns, the salt for consump- 
tion in the country being just reduced to twenty 
paras. 

* (3) An increase of the duty on tobacco to 
twelve piastres the oke. 

* (4) The tax on the repairing of buildings. 

* (5) The tax on fish. 

* 5. What is the mode of collection now em- 

ployedy that of farming taxes or " en regie '* f 

^5. The tithes, the Rousoumat, the sheep-tax, 
and the fish-tax are farmed, the rest are collected 
" en regie.^^ 

* The tithes were collected on account of 
Government in 1863 and the two following years, 
at the expiration of which period a return to 
the old system of farming them out took place. 
It would naturally be supposed that the peasantry 
would have preferred the method of making their 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 229 

payments direct to Government, who only raised 
the same revenue from the tithes as they now 
receive from those who farm them. The profits 
made by these latter, which are generally con- 
siderable, should have been reaped by the villagers, 
but it was found in many villages that two or 
three of the headmen who kept the accounts 
with the Government enriched themselves at 
the expense of the rest, who from their ignorance 
of reading and writing were unable to check 
the frauds practised on them, and who, though 
they had tamely submitted to be plundered by 
the former tithe-farmers, could not bear to see 
their fellow-villagers make a profit out of them. 
The dissatisfaction thus created, though by no 
means universal, was fostered by the influential 
members of the Mejlis sitting at the capital, 
who through their creatures had been in the 
habit of farming the tithes, and who caused 
Mazbattas expressive of a desire for a return to 
the old system of farming to be circulated amongst 
the villages for signature, a method which pro- 
duced the desired result. 

* 6. What is the effect of the present system 
on any f articular branches of industry ? 

^ 6. The system as at present practised of levy- 
ing the taxes on the manufacture of wine and 
spirits, which is the most important branch of 
industry in the Island, has a most injurious eflFect 
on the production of those articles. 

* In the first place, the grapes are liable to the 
usual tithe of 10 per cent, levied on all agricul-

tural produce. When they have been converted 
into wine and spirits, the latter are subjected 
to another tax of lo per cent, imposed in a most 
vexatious and arbitrary manner. Government 
officers are sent down from the capital of the Island 
to the wine-growing districts about the month 
of November, where, going from village to village, 
they proceed to value the stock of wine belonging 
to each proprietor, none of whom, on pain of a 
heavy fine, are allowed to dispose of their stocks 
before they have been measured and valued.

As many of these employes are ignorant of the 
value of the several kinds of wine, the law provides 
that the prices, purporting to be the market- 
prices, on the basis of which the duty is levied, 
shall be annually fixed at a meeting of the local 
Mejlises to which should be invited two wine- 
merchants, two vine-growers, and the tax-gather- 
ers. This legal provision is not carried out, 
the vine-growers never being summoned to give 
their opinion, and that of the merchants being 
often overruled by the tax-gatherers, so that it 
not infrequently happens that the tax is based 
on a price which the grower cannot afterwards 
realize. In deciding too on the value of the 
different qualities of wines, a function which a 
connoisseur in native growths is alone capable 
of performing, the Government employes are 
often grievously at fault through over-estimating 
their values. 

* Finally, the wine, which has already paid the 
tithe of 10 per cent, while in the grape, and then 
a tax of 10 per cent, after its conversion into 
wine, is further subjected to the export duty of 
8 per cent, on its shipment to other parts of 
Turkey. For many years subsequent to 1854 the 
Cyprus vineyards were ravaged by the same de- 
structive disease which desolated the vine-growing 
countries of Europe, from the eflPects of which 
they have never recovered. Even since the 
abatement of that malady, however, the wine 
trade has not been more prosperous, owing to 
the heavy taxation it is subjected to, no less 
than to the unpopular manner in which tnat 
taxation is raised. The common black wine of 
the Island, which is extremely cheap, and I am 
bound to say nasty, is largely consumed in Egypt 
and in the Levant generally. In 1854 the ex- 
portation of this wine amounted to 3,840,000 
okes, and of the more palatable Commanderia 
to 512,000 okes, while no less than a million okes 
of Raki also left the Island. At the present time 
the exportation of these wines has fallen off by 
exactly one-half and that of Raki to 300,000 okes, 
the latter being even undersold by spirits imported 
from Trieste. 

* Tobacco-culture is another species of agricul- 
tural industry which has been gradually languish- 
ing under the heavy hand of taxation, and which 
were it not for the extensive system of smuggling 
carried on would have still further declined. At 
present Government derives a revenue of less than 
P. 30,000 a year from the duty on this narcotic. 

* 7. What reforms seem to be most called for ? 
• * 7. In order to raise the wine trade from the 



232 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

state of depression into which it has fallen two 
teforms are greatly needed, first a reduction of 
duty, and secondly a less arbitrary mode of 
levying that duty. The simple method of raising 
the tithes on grapes from lo to 15 per cent, 
and aboUshing the duty on wine would remove all 
ground for complaint. I should add that the 
present system has been in operation since 1858, 
and though the vine-growers have doubtless 
suffered chiefly from the grape disease, this 
extensive branch of industry would probably 
have rallied from its destructive effects, as it has 
elsewhere, if a less onerous and more equitable 
system of taxation prevailed. 

- ^ Similarly a reduction of duty on the common 
kinds iof tobacco would diminish the temptation 
to smuggling, and also by putting it in the power 
iof the poor to indulge more freely in the habit 
of smoking, the privation from which is a real 
hardship, the consumption of tobacco would 
perhaps be so far increased as to cover the loss 
incurred by the proposed remission of part of 
the duty. 

^ 8. Has any attempt been made to establish 
a cadastre of real property F 

* 8. An Agent arrived here last winter from 
Constantinople with a staff of sixteen clerks 
charged wdth the mission of establishing a cadastre 
of real property in the Island. He has been 
engaged in this occupation ever since, but his 
proceedings are viewed with dislike by the land-* 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 233 

owners, who are aware that a new system of taxa- 
tion, the burden of which is to be borne by them- 
selves, will be the result of his visit. A temporary 
consequence of this state of feeling is a fall in the 
value of land and a difficulty in eflPecting sales 
of real property, which is likely to last until the 
intentions of Government are officially declared. 
Complaints are general that the estimates already 
made of the value of landed property are too 
high, but it is difficult to know how far such 
complaints are well-founded. 

* In order to meet the expenses attending the 
making of this cadastre a tax of 4 per mille 
on the assessed value of the property is to be 
raised, and 3 per cent, on its annual value is 
said to be the amount of the taxation hereafter 
to be imposed. 

* 9. On what basis is the " Verghi " assessed ? 

' 9. The Verghi is assessed in the following 
manner. The central Mejlis of Nicosia fixes 
every four years the amount to be paid by the 
several districts (Kazas) , regard being had to their 
population rather than to their prosperity ; the 
district Mejlises decide the part to be borne by 
each village, and the chief men of a village levy 
a sum on every able-bodied man from eighteen 
years old and upwards in their village. The 
basis on which they assess the Verghi seems to 
be that as much as possible should be squeezed 
out of the poor who contribute out of all propor- 
tion to their means, a farmer possessed of land 
and making his ;^ioo a year assessing himself at 



234 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

P, 150 and the poor day-labourer barely earning 
j^20 a year at seventy or eighty Piastres. 

* 10. What is the result of the working of the 
Anglo-Turkish Commercial treaty of April 
29, 1861 /^ What reforms seem to he called 
for in the interest of British trade ? 

^ 10. The result of the working of the Anglo- 
Turkish Commercial treaty of 1861 may be 
considered under two heads, first as it affects 
Turkey, and secondly as it affects Great Britain. 

^ First. The working of the treaty is probably 
as advantageous to Turkey in general as it has 
been to Cyprus, the diminishing export duty 
encouraging the trade in all those raw materials 
which constitute the great bulk of her exports. 
In this Island the staple articles of export to 
Europe consist in cotton, madder roots, and 
caroubs, and though the operation of more 
important and well-known causes have in recent 
years stimulated the trade in the first of these 
commodities, the small export duty has no doubt 
had its part in extending its cultivation. 

' As regards the Import Duty the difference 
between 5 and 8 per cent, has not had any 
perceptible effect in discouraging the demand 
for British fabrics. In Cyprus the country 
people have long been in the habit of weaving 
their own clothing, the material of which consists 
chiefly of cotton grown by themselves, the women 
of each family supplying the clothing required 
for their own households. The townspeople 
on the contrary wear exclusively stuffs of foreign 
manufacture imported for the most part from 
England. 

* The duty of 8 per cent, levied on the transit 
from one Turkish port to another of all goods, 
whether manufactured or in the raw material, 
though forming no part of the Treaty under 
consideration, should yet be viewed in connexion 
with it, as it has a fatal effect in discouraging 
native industrial enterprise, which, but for this 
tax, the above Treaty was calculated to foster. 
There are no manufactures of importance in this 
Island, silk, cotton, and leather being manufactured 
only in sufficient quantities to meet local wants. 
The chief items of exports to Turkey, consisting 
in grain, wine, dairy produce, and articles of raw 
material, all suffer from the high duty imposed 
on them. 

* The Customs in Cyprus, which are derived 
chiefly from exports, are annually diminishing, 
a result which can excite no surprise. 

* Secondly. The working of the Treaty as 
it regards England has been, I conceive, entirely 
to its advantage, the extra 3 per cent, of 
Import Duty being naturally paid by the foreign 
consumer, and the reduction in the export 
duties being manifestly in favour of the inhabitants 
of both countries. 

' Owing to the uncertainty attending all 
estimates of the annual importations of British 
goods at small ports like that of Larnaca, where 
they are imported under a foreign flag, and 
in considerable quantities at a time, by native 



236 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

iiierchants residing in Beyrout, Smyrna, and Syra, 
instead of direct from England, it is impossible 
to state with the necessary exactitude what 
variations have taken place in the trade in British 
manufactured goods, and hence the difficulty 
of estimating the effect produced in that trade 
by the increased duty. It is not generally sup- 
posed, however, that the demand for British- 
manufactured goods in Cyprus has fallen oflF in 
consequence of the extra duty, nor is this an 
unreasonable conclusion seeing that no native 
manufacture .has been called into competition, 
and the centres of population continue as before 
dependent for their supply of cotton stuffs on 
foreign markets. 

^ The diminution of the duty on exports has 
doubtless greatly benefited British trade, par- 
ticularly at a crisis when the demand for cotton 
in England was unprecedented. The stimulus 
then given to the cultivation of that staple was 
prodigious, and the profits accruing from the 
remission of so much duty were reaped mainly 
by England. In spite of the fall in prices the 
demand for cotton is still active, but the profits 
to be made by the native grower have now reached 
a point such that if 12 per cent, were still the 
duty levied, the cultivation would probably begin 
to suffer a decline. 

* I cannot suggest any reforms which wovdd be 
for the interest of British trade, the trade carried 
on between this Island and Great Britain furnish- 
ing no grounds for dissatisfaction to those en- 
gaged in it.' 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 237 

In November 1867, ^^^ Vice-Consul reports 
to Constantinople that a Staff Ofl&cer of the 
MUitary Train has arrived in Cyprus to buy 
mules for the Abyssinian Campaign, and has 
purchased 800 animals, 700 at j^20 a head and 
100 at j^i8 los. He adds that the Director of 
the Transport Service in Egypt pronounced the 
mules the finest and most serviceable yet supplied. 

This despatch recalls the fact that the mules 
of Cyprus are well known for their excellent 
quality. Cypriote mules had previously been 
used by the British Army in the Crimean War, 
and proved their usefulness in the Egyptian Cam- 
paign of 1882 and in the Great War of 1914-18. 

In 1868, as has been stated, the arrangement, 
whereby in 1861 Cyprus was created an indepen- 
dent Mutessariflik, was temporarily reversed by 
the inclusion of the island in the Vilayet of the 
Dardanelles ; and in his despatch of May 26, 
1868, the Acting Vice-Consul informs the Em- 
bassy in Constantinople of a visit paid by the 
Vali, whose headquarters were at Chanaq, to 
his new dependency : 

* Referring to despatch No. 6 under date 8 th 
ulto. of Mr. T. B. Sandwith, advising Your 
Excellency that this Island was in future to form 
part of the Vilayet of the Dardanelles, I have 
the honour to communicate for the information 
of Your Excellency that His Excellency Ahmet 
Klaiserli Pasha, Head of the Vilayet, has just made 
a visit of five weeks to this Island, leaving this for 
Rhodes on the 19th instant. His Excellency 



238 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

while here made most strenuous eflForts for the 
destruction of locusts — a scourge from which 
the Island has suffered for many years — and I 
have much pleasure in stating that these exertions 
were crowned with very considerable success. It 
is the opinion of His Excellency and competent 
judges here that with persevering effort in August 
of this year and May and June of next the de- 
struction of locusts would be so far attained as to 
prevent their doing any harm to the crops of 
the Island. 

^ Throughout the Island there is for the present 
considerable confusion from the introduction of 
the new Vilayet system, and the necessary re- 
construction of the local Medjlisses. The country 
population are scarcely able, from ignorance and 
ineptitude, to carry out many of the new reforms, 
and at the first much difficulty will be felt ; but 
it is to be hoped that a little time will suffice 
to fit them for the more liberal system now intro- 
duced and which may be expected especially to 
have an advantageous influence on the Christian 
population. 

* It is to be regretted, and is most inconvenient, 
that the capital of the Vilayet to which Cyprus is 
attached (Dardanelles) should be so far removed, 
and this defect will probably counteract many 
of the advantages which the new system promised 
to confer.' 

In 1869 a further questionnaire, dealing with 
taxation, was issued by the Embassy ; it was 
answered as follows by Vice-Consul Sandwith, 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 239 

in his detailed and illuminating despatch of 
June 19, 1869 : 

^ I. What are the amounts of verghi or other 
corresponding tax imposed on your Vilayet 
and its subdivisions as far as can be ascer- 
tained by you ? 

* I. In the Island of Cyprus, which forms part 
of the Vilayet of the Mediterranean Islands under 
Turkish rule exclusive of Candia and Samos, the 
Verghi amounts to 2,950,000 piastres. 

* 2. Have those amounts been permanent since 
1 840, or when and how are they revised ? 

^ 2. This amount has been permanent since 
1840. 

* The amounts payable by each village are re- 
vised every four years by the District Mejlises. 
If complaints are made by certain villages that 
the sums levied on them are excessive on account 
of the decrease of the population either by the 
death or migration of their inhabitants or a 
temporary scarcity, the heads, called Mucktars, 
of such villages present themselves before the 
District Mejlis to establish the truth of their 
assertions, and if the Mejlis is satisfied that they 
have made good their case, a deduction is made 
from their taxes and the difference added to those 
of some other village or villages in the same Sanjak. 
Such is the legal provision devised for keeping 
up an equitable distribution of taxation, but it 
is seldom that it can be put into practice on 



240 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

account of the corrupt composition of the 
Mejlises. 

* 3, How far have the " Cadastre " (takriri- 

emlak) and the new taxes Salyave and 
Timettou been introduced and with what 
general results ? 

* 3. In one only of the sixteen Sanjaks into 
which Cyprus is divided, that in which the 
capital, Nicosia, is situated, has the Cadastre been 
carried out, and the Timettou introduced. The 
general results seem to be a somewhat larger 
return of revenue to the Exchequer than under 
the former system, and a much more equitable 
distribution, the rich and poor paying according 
to their means. 

* 4. ^ome reports state that " the district 

councils allot to each sect and village its 
quota of the tax. The Heads of the several 
Communities are charged with and respon- 
sible for the due collection from their co- 
religionists J^ Is this still so ? If sOy what 
is the mechanism adopted? What are the 
names of the administrative unities in your 
district ? Is Religion or Locality the basis 
of the apportionment? 

' 4. The statement conveyed in this question 
is practically correct. In Cyprus the population 
of the majority of the villages is mixed, divided 
between Mussulmans and Christians of the 
Greek Orthodox rite. Each of the two communi- 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 241 

ties in a village pays its own quota of the Vergh;, 
which is fixed by the District Mejlis, and it is 
collected by the head-man or Mucktar of each 
community, who pays it into the District Treas- 
ury. The Mucktars are looked on as responsible 
for the due collection of the Verghi, but if they 
indicate one or more of the inhabitants who have 
failed to pay their portion of the tax, they can 
procure its levy by distress or have the defaulters 
imprisoned. It more usually happens, however, 
when a village is in arrears, that a zaptieh is sent 
to exact the sum due, who lives at the expense 
of the village till it is paid up, and then the 
money is quickly got together by loan or other 
means, in order to get rid of the unwelcome guest. 
The administrative unities in Cyprus are : 

^ A Pasha of the lowest rank, or Mir- Mir an. 

^ Five Kaimakams. 

^ Ten Mudirs. 

* Locality is the basis of apportionment. 

* 5. ^he new Verghi {Salyave and Titnettou)^ 
being taxes of a certain proportion of each 
marCs property and income, would seem to 
he no longer an " impot de repartition.^^ 
Does the new system prevail in some Kazas 
and the old system of repartition in other or 
parts of others? 

* 5. The new system of Timettou prevails as 
yet in only one of the sixteen administrative 
Districts of this Island, as already mentioned in 
my answer to question 3. The " Cadastre *'

officials consisting of a chief and twelve assistants \ i 
have been engaged in their work since the begin- ri 
ning of 1867, but a great part of it has had to be ! ^ 
cancelled by the Governor in consequence of its ':i 
unsatisfactory execution, a secret system of 
valuing property having been resorted to, without 
the knowledge, that is, of the owners, whose own 
estimates of the value of their property ought 
at least to be compared with the official estimates 
before being fixed by law. The dissatisfaction 
with such a system was so great as to lead to a 
general revision of the work already executed. 
All the other districts in Cyprus continue to pay 
the Verghi as before. 

^ 6. Jre Government officials^ members of 
Medjlis^ y^., exempt from Verghi or from 
any other tax ? 

^ 6. Government officials are exempted from 
taxation only so far as their salaries are concerned. 
For real property they pay like other subjects 
of the Sultan.

data that may he easily procurable ; es-

ing data.

to obtain from oflScial sources, represents the

^ If 100,000 piastres be allowed for incidental

ing this Island amounts to 2,512,936 piastres a 
year. Deducting this sum from the total annual 

revenue — ^ o r o 

VIZ. 16,836,874 

2,512,936 

there remains the sum of 1 4,323,9 3 8 

available for the Treasury at the capital. 

* In calculating the amount of taxation per 
head of population, deduction must be made from 
the total revenue of the sum of 2,929,550 piastres, 
the produce of the salt lakes, due to the bounty 
of nature. On the other hand, in addition to 
the items of normal revenue enumerated above, 
a pretext is aflForded every year for some extra- 
ordinary call on the peasantry. One year it is a 
forced loan, another year a road tax, now a con- 
tribution for the formation of an agricultural 
Bank, and now for the destruction of locusts. 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 247 

The road' tax was levied for four successive years, 
and no work was done to show for it ; the last 
year the contributions for the agricultural Bank 
and the destruction of locusts were both collected, 
the latter tax being an annual charge. The sums 
collected for the formation of an agricultural 
Bank, the proceeds of which have never been 
accounted for, though its intention was to aid 
cultivators in the purchase of stock, amount to 
about 300,000 piastres, being the value of a kilo 
of wheat and a kilo of barley from the owner of 
every pair of bullocks used in ploughing. The 
locust tax is a much more onerous burden, and 
amounted last year to 4,000,000 piastres, con- 
siderably more than the total amount of the 
Verghi. If these two sums be added to the 
normal revenue above stated, and the proceeds 
of the salt monopoly eliminated, as not being 
a contribution by the peasantry, there remains 
the sum of 18,207,324 piastres, collected from a 
population estimated at 180,000, giving loi 
piastres, or eighteen shillings sterling, as the 
taxation per head. 

' The sums of 4,000,000 piastres of locust tax 
and 300,000 piastres for the agricultural Bank 
I have not calculated in the surplus available for 
the Treasury at Constantinople, because the 
former amount was actually expended in carrying 
out the object for which it was raised ; and if the 
same cannot be said for the latter sum, it has 
certainly not gone to fill the Imperial coffers.' 

As the Acting Vice-Consul had foretold in his 



248 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

despatch of May 26, 1868, quoted above, the 
distance of Cyprus from the headquarters of the 
Vilayet, of which it was now a part, proved 
detrimental to the good government of the island ; 
and Vice-Consul Sandwith, writing to the Em- 
bassy on April 9, 1870, two years after the appli- 
cation of the Vilayet system to Cyprus, was 
compelled to urge that its administrative inde- 
pendence should be restored : • 

*The system of government known as the 
Vilayet system recently established in Turkey 
has now been on its trial in this Island for a 
period of two years. As I cannot but think its 
working in the small sphere brought under my 
notice to be unsatisfactory, I will venture to 
point out one or two of its capital defects. 

* The most serious defect seems to me to be the 
withdrawal of power from the local authorities 
and its concentration at the headquarters of the 
Vilayet. Were Cyprus within easy reach of its 
governmental capital at the Dardanelles, or 
connected with it by telegraph, reference to head- 
quarters being then easily practicable, the evil 
of divided authority might not be felt. As it is, 
the Island has communication with the Dar- 
danelles only once a fortnight, and the delays 
consequent on this isolation are serious and 
manifest. The limitation of the Governor's 
power renders it especially necessary that reference 
to his immediate superior should be rapid and 
frequent. The ends of justice too often fail of 
attainment by the tardy and costly communica- 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 249 

tion, as may be readily conceived when it is taken 
into account that the Governor's power of 
punishment in criminal plaints is Umited to three 
months' imprisonment. Cases of a graver nature 
are carried for judgment to the Dardanelles ; and 
as it is precisely in such cases that the greatest 
difficulty is found in procuring witnesses willing 
to give evidence, on account of the necessity 
of their attendance at a distant tribunal, impunity 
is thus enjoyed by the worst class of criminals. 
The law obliging heinous offences to be carried 
to a higher court implies that the members of 
such court are of superior intelligence to those 
composing the lower tribunal. Now I will 
venture to say, from what I can learn, that the 
members composing the Me j lis of the Dar- 
danelles, before which grave cases are tried, are 
not a whit superior, in point of education and 
general intelligence, to the members of local 
Mejlis here. Cases of administration affecting 
the interests of the Island are submitted to the 
appreciation of a body of men for the most part 
indifferent to the questions proposed to them, 
and generally ignorant, from the want of local 
knowledge, of the merits of those questions. 

^ In the internal administration, the action of 
the Governor is further trammelled by the slender 
authority he possesses over the subordinate 
Governors, who hold their appointments direct 
from the Vali at the Dardanelles, are in some cases 
his creatures, and, as long as they can keep in 
favour with him, are indifferent to the good 
opinion of the local Pasha, 



2SO THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

^ The dissatisfaction throughout the Island 
with the new order of things is so general that I 
am informed that an effort is being made by the 
most influential inhabitants to have Cyprus 
erected into a separate Vilayet. They argue that 
Cyprus is in itself more important than all the 
rest of the Vilayet, embracing the Turkish Archi- 
pelago, put together, and contributes more to the 
Imperial Treasury. The extra experiditure in- 
volved in the change proposed would be trifling, 
as it would not be necessary to raise the Pasha^s 
salary, and whatever that expenditure might 
amount to, the Island is quite ready to take the 
additional burden upon itself. 

' I have been requested to make representations 
to you in favour of the formation of this Island 
into a separate Vilayet, and as I am persuaded 
that this is no party movement, but is based on 
rational grounds, arid am aware also that most 
pf my colleagues have written or intend writing 
to their respective Embassies in the same sense, 
I have thought it my duty to bring the subject 
befcre you as more competent to judge of its 
merits than mvself.' 

In the same year, 1870, Cyprus, already afflicted 
by the ravages of locusts, which the local Governor j 
Said Pasha, had done much to combat, suffered 
an additional misfortune through drought and 
its attendant famine. Relief works, in the 
shape of the Larnaca- Nicosia road, were under- 
taken, taxation was remitted, and in April th$ 
Vali of the Dardanelles, Ahmed Pasha, paid a 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 251 

visit of two weeks' duration to the island. From 
a despatch, dated M^y ip, from Vice-Consul 
Sandwith to the Embassy in Constantinople, 
we learn that the Vali's recommendations were 
the sinking of artesian wells and the dredging 
of the old harbour of Famagusta, where, appar- 
ently, Ahmed Pasha hoped to discover a Venetian 
treasure.^ * In consequence,' says Hackett, ^ of 
the misery and losses sustained by the islanders 
through these two crushing misfortunes it was 
resolved to petition the supreme Government 
for some measures of relief. A deputation 
composed of four members, two Christians and 
two Moslems, and headed by the Archbishop, 
was accordingly despatched to Constantinople. 
So well did it plead the cause of the distressed 
islanders, ably seconded by the advocacy of the 
Cypriot Qibrisli Mehmed Pasha,* that in the 
short space of one month and a half it succeeded 
iii obtaining the two concessions for which it 
asked. A firman was issued withdrawing Cyprus 
from the Vilayet of the Islands and constituting 
Tt ah independent Mutessariflik, while the 
necessary seed for the following year was author- 
ized to be drawn from the Government granaries 
in the island.' ^ 

This, the last constitutional change in Cyprus 

* The only treasure discovered when the harbour was actually^ 
dredged in 1903-6 was one of the nineteen cannon presented by 
Henry VIII to L'lsle Adam for the recapture of Rhodes.

prior to the British occupation, was announced 
by the Governor in a letter to the Vice-Consul, 
dated August i, 1870 : 

* To THE British Vice-Consul {Tl), 

^ His Imperial Majesty, having heard that 
the inhabitants of the island of Cyprus experience 
difficulties in the transaction of their business and 
in their dealings with the Government owing 
to its distance from the capital of the Vilayet, 
has been graciously pleased to consider the means 
thereby this difficulty may be removed, and has 
decided to detach the island and erect it into 
an independent Mutessariflik. . . . 

^ The Governor of Cyprus, 

*Mehmed Said.' 

In reporting, on October 24, 1871, the arrival 
in Cyprus of the first Governor-General of the 
island under the new regime, the Acting Consul " 
gives the Ambassador a pleasing, and, as regards 
the last paragraph at any rate, a characteristic 
glimpse of Turkish administration : 

* I have the honour to inform Your Excellency 
of the arrival here of an Ottoman steamer on 
the 1 6th instant with H. E. Aziz Pasha, newly 
appointed Governor-General of this island, and 
superseding Mehmet Said Pasha. After per- 
forming quarantine in the Lazzaretto here H. E.

status of a Consulate. 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 253 

proceeded on the 22nd instant to Nicosia to 
assume his post of Governor- General. 

* I feel it to be a conscientious duty to bring 
to the knowledge of Your Excellency the very 
general though not wholly unanimous regret 
felt throughout this island at the departure of 
H. E. Said Pasha. Whatever may have been 
the defects of his administrative government, 
none of his predecessors has ever effected so much 
as. he has done for the material interests of the 
island — in the construction of roads — building 
bridges — clearing and repairing water-courses-3- 
and, greatest of all, the entire destruction of the 
locusts, which for a long previous period con- 
stituted the greatest scourge of this island, whilst 
his zealous and benevolent solicitude for the 
poor during the misery and distress of last winter 
through the failure of the grain crops cannot be 
forgotten by the many who were the recipient of 
his bounty and who owe their means of existence 
during that hard period to his care and assistance. 

^ I have further to report to Your Excellency 
the arrival yesterday of the Ottoman steamer 
Izeditij which is reported to have brought here 
Husni Pasha, ex-Minister of Police, and Emin 
Bey Effendi, ex- First Secretary of the Palace of 
His Majesty the Sultan, who, as I am informed, 
have been exiled to this island.' 

A despatch of January 26, 1872, from Consul 
R. H. Lang to the Ambassador, Sir Henry Elliot, 
refers to an attempt to revive the importation 
of slaves into Cyprus : 



254 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

* For some time past, in this Island, an increase 
has been observable in the trafficking in slaves ; 
and quite recently these operations assumed a new 
phase by the importation of negresses from the 
coast of Barbary. Upon receiving reliable iix-: 
formation in regard to one of these importations 
I thought it my duty to bring the matter to th^ 
notice of His Excellency the Governor -General 
of this Island and urge him to take such measures 
as might put an end to this illegal commerce. .- . . 

* I have pleasure in bearing testifeiony tb the 
^--ptompt and energetic manner in which His 

Excellency Aziz Pasha has acted in this matter. 
The guilt of the native captain against whom 
I informed was clearly proved. He has been 
sent to Nicosia for trial and I understand will be 
condemned to one year's imprisonment. Thi| 
signal punishment will doubtless suffice to arrest 
the inhuman trade which would certainly, with- 
out this example, have assumed considerable 
proportions. 

* It is extremely gratifying to find the laws of 
the Empire so loyally carried out, both in their 
letter and spirit, even upon a question which 
is looked upon with indifference by the large 
majority of Orientals.' ^

^ This letter tends to refute, if refutation were necessary, the 
totally unfounded allegation of Frau Ohnefalsch-Richter on 
p. i8i of Griechische Sitten und Gebrduche auf Cypem (Berlin,

the slave traffic so as to keep on good terms with the Pashas ;

THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 255 

was celebrated for the extent and beauty of its 
forests. The beauty of the forests that survive 
is unimpaired ; but their extent was sadly 
reduced by the ravages of mediaeval and Venetian 
shipbuilders, followed by reckless and improvident 
felling for fuel by the peasantry during the 
Turkish administration. Since 1879 so much has 
had to be done by the British Government, both 
in preserving and in reafforesting, in order to 
arrest the damage caused through its predecessor's 
remissness, that the existence of Turkish regula- 
tions for the protection of the forests of Cyprus 
is somewhat surprising. That they existed, 
however, is proved by the following document : 



* To THE British Consul (1^, 

* The local Government having learned 
that, notwithstanding the small number of 
forests in Cyprus, trees continue to be felled as 
before both for fuel to drive engines as well as 
for export, and that if this state of things does not 
cease the forests will soon disappear, thereby 
reducing the rainfall, the Central Mejlis Idard 
has decreed as follows : 

* " It is forbidden henceforth to export wood 
or to use it to drive engines ; he who is found 
disobeying this order will be fined, and the wood 
will be confiscated by the Municipality." 

* His Excellency the Governor-General having 
applied the above regulation to all the Qaimaqam- 
liks, I have to request that you will be good enough 
to notify your nation also that henceforth they 



256 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

must neither export wood nor use it for thdr 
engines.

The year 1876 was an eventful one in Turkish 
history, for it witnessed within the space of three 
months the deposition and murder of Sultan 
'Abdu'l 'Aziz, the brief reign and deposition 
of his successor, Murad V,^ and the accession of 
the latter's brother, 'Abdu'l Hamid II. These 
dramatic events were officially announced to the 
British Consulate in Cyprus in the following 
laconic missives from the Qaimaqam of Larnaca : 

* To THE British Consul (T), 

' I have just received a telegram, dated 
May 18, Old Style, wherein His Excellency the 
lutessarif states that he has received a telegram

* Yesterday, at one o'clock in the evening, 
I received a telegram from His Excellency the 
Mutessarif, informing me that the Grand Vizier 
had telegraphed to him to announce that, as 
Sultan Murad could not recover from the malady 
from which he has suffered since his accession to 
the throne, therefore, in accordance with the 
Sheri' Law, he has been dethroned and the heir, 
Sultan 'Abdu'l Hamid Khan H, has, in accordance 
with the Ottoman Nizam, ascended the throne 
on the nth Sha'ban, 1292 (Thursday).

On December 23, 1876, the first Ottoman 
Parliament came into being; and it transpires 
incidentally from a letter dealing with other 
matters that to this short-lived Assembly, with 
which the name of Midhat Pasha is generally 

17 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

associated, Cyprus returned one member, a 
Turk of the name of Mehmed Eflfendi Sofuzade. 
Four months after the constitution of * Midhat's 
Parliament, there broke out the fourth war of 
the nineteenth century between Russia and 
Turkey. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-8 
was destined to have the most profound effect 
on the fate of Cyprus ; its more immediate 
result, however, so far as the island was concerned, 
was a month of panic on the part of the Christian 
population. In consequence of the Russian 
conquests in Armenia and the Caucasus, large 
numbers of Moslem Circassians, unwilling to live 
under Russian rule, left their homes in the con- 
quered districts and migrated into Turkish 
territory. The Ottoman Government, while 
establishing the bulk of these recruits to their 
Mohammedan population on the marches of 
Persia and Kurdistan, where it was hoped that 
they might intimidate the lawless Kurdish and 
Beduin tribes, distributed the remainder in small 
colonies in the more settled portions of the 
Empire, and in March 1878 allocated some 600 
Circassians to Cyprus. The Orthodox Cypriotes 
received the announcement with dismay. In 
the first place, they objected to any increase in 
the Moslem element of the population ; secondly, 
the unenviable reputation of the Circassians led 
them to fear that the new colonists would en- 
deavour to live by brigandage and marauding. 
Meetings of protest against their landing were 
held in all the towns ; petitions were addressed 
to the European Consuls, praying that the Porte 
might be dissuaded from its purpose. In the 
midst of the excitement a steamer conveying 
3,000 Circassians destined for Latakia ran aground 
on the Karpass peninsula, and the landing of 
these people in the island aroused such agitation 
among the Christians that not only were they 
speediy removed, but the colony intended for
Cyprus was diverted to Adalia. 

Hostilities between Russia and Turkey came to 
an end with the signature, on March 3, 1878, 
of the Treaty of San Stefano ; but this instrument, 
whose principal feature was the creation of a vast 
Bulgaria, with a frontage both on the Black Sea 
and the Aegean, and extending very nearly to 
the Adriatic, provoked opposition from so many 
quarters that an international conference for its 
revision was summoned to meet at Berlin. 

The Congress of Berlin opened on June 13 
and concluded its labours precisely one month 
later ; in the meantime, however, on June .4, 
1878, a * Convention of defensive alliance,' 
negotiated by Lord Beaconsfield, had been 
signed between Great Britain and Turkey, 
* with the object of securing for the future the 
territories in Asia of His Imperial Majesty the 
Sultan.' The principal article of the Convention, 
whereby the Sultan assigned Cyprus to be ad- 
ministered by Great Britain, is as follows : 

^ If Batoum, Ardahan, Kars, or any of them 
shall be retained by Russia, and if any attempt 
shall be made at any future time by Russia to take 
possession of any further territories of His Im- 



26o THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

perial Majesty the Sultan in Asia, as fixed by 
the Defensive Treaty of Peace, England engages 
to join His Imperial Majesty the Sultan in de- 
fending them by force of arms. 

* In return, His Imperial Majesty the Sultan 
promises to England to introduce necessary re- 
forms, to be agreed upon later between the two 
Powers, into the Government, and for the pro- 
tection of the Christian and other subjects of 
the Porte in these territories ; and in order to 
enable England to make necessary provision for 
executing her engagement. His Imperial Majesty 
the Sultan further consents to assign the Island 
of Cyprus to be occupied and administered by 
England.' 

In an Annex to the Convention, and in two 
Supplementary Agreements, were regulated the 
circumstances in which Cyprus was to be ad- 
ministered by Great Britain. The Annex is as 
follows : 

^ The Right Honourable Sir A. H. Layard, 
G.C.B., and his Highness Safvet Pasha, now the 
Grand Vizier of His Majesty the Sultan, hav6 
agreed to the following Annex to the Convention 
signed by them as Plenipotentiaries of their re- 
spective Governments on the 4th June, 1878 : 

* " It is understood between the two High 
Contracting Parties that England agrees to the 
following conditions relating to her occupation 
and administration of the Island of Cyprus : 

* " I. That a Mussulman religious Tribunal

Island, which will take exclusive cognizance of 
religious matters, and of no others, concerning 
the Mussulman population of the Island. 

* " II. That a Mussulman resident in the 
Island shall be named by the Board of Pious 
Foundations in Turkey (Evqaf) to superintend, 
in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed 
by the British "Authorities, the administration 
of the property, funds, and lands belonging 
to mosques, cemeteries, Mussulman schools, 
and other religious establishments existing in 
Cyprus. 

' " III. That England will pay to the Porte 
whatever is the present excess of revenue over 
expenditure in the Island; this excess to be 
calculated upon and determined by the average 
of the last five years, stated to be 22,936 purses, 
to be duly verified hereafter, and to the exclusion 
of the produce of State and Crown lands let or 
sold during that period. 

^ " IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely 
sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus 
belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State 
(Arazi-i-Mirie ve Emlaq-i-Humayun), the produce 
of which does not form part of the revenue of the 
Island referred to in Article III.

their competent authorities, may purchase com- 
pulsorily, at a fair price, land required for public 
improvements, or for other public purposes, and 
land which is not cultivated.

Convention of the 4th June, 1878, signed by 
them as Plenipotentiaries of their respective 
Governments. 

^ It is understood between the High Contract- 
ing Parties, without prejudice to the express 
provisions of the Articles I, II, and IV of the 
Annex of the ist of July, 1878, that His Imperial 
Majesty the Sultan, in assigning the Island of 
Cyprus to be occupied and administered by 
England, has thereby transferred to and vested 
in Her Majesty the Queen, for the term of the 
occupation and no longer, full powers for making

Although, aa we have seen, the Convention, 
whereby the administration of Cyprus was 
entrusted to Great Britain was signed on June 4, 
no intimation of this fact reached the Island until 
more than a month later. On the other hand, a 
sudden influx into the island of speculators from 
Constantinople gave rise to rumours of the 
change which was impending. On July 5 Consul 
WatHns telegraphed to Sir Henry Layard of the 
existence of these rumours, and five days later 
addressed to him the following despatch : 

' Lakhaca, 

'July 10, ''°''° 
' Sir, 

' . , . The rumours to which my tel 
alluded had their origin in the fact that ! 
Agents of Banking houses in Constantinop] 
had arrived here on the 26th ult., ostensit 



268 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

the purpose of bidding for the Dimes of the Island, 
began about the ist instant to purchase house- 
property and land. These purchases still con- 
tinue, the sums invested up to the present amount- 
ing to about j^.40,000, and the prices paid 
exceeding by three times and more those which 
would have been given under ordinary circum- 
stances before. 

* The presence of the fleet under Vice- Admiral 
Lord John Hay gave more consistence to the 
rumours about a British occupation of Cyprus. 
H.M.S. Raleigh anchored off Larnaca on the 
3rd instant and was followed next day by the 
Invincible. The Admiral was descried opposite 
" Dades " point towards sunset on the 4th 
instant ; but the fleet kept cruising outside the 
Bay (with the exception of the Raleigh) until 
Monday the 8th, when they all anchored in our 
Roads. 

* I feel it my duty moreover to telegraph the 
news to Your Excellency as the local Government, 
somewhat uneasy on account of these rumours 
and occurrences, sent from Nicosia the Secretary 
of the Vilayet to see what was going on, with the 
intention of telegraphing to Constantinople, 
and representing matters in an excited point 
of view.' 

Two days after the above despatch was written 
an end was put to rumour by the following 
announcement, conveyed to the Consul by direc- 
tion of Vice- Admiral (afterwards Admiral of the 
Fleet) Lord John Hay: 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 269 

* Larnaca, 

'July 12, 1878.. 

^SlR, 

* I am directed by Vice- Admiral Lord 
John. Hay, C.B., to inform you that His Lordship 
has, in accordance with a Convention between 
Her Majesty the Queen and His Majesty the 
Sultan, and under the authority of a Firman by 
the Sultan, been commanded by Her Majesty's 
Government to assume the temporary Govern- 
ment of the Island of Cyprus in the name of Her 
Majesty; that he has, this day, accordingly 
assumed the temporary administration of the 
Government, and has hoisted the British Flag at 
Nicosia, the capital of the Island. 

* I have the honor to be. Sir, 

^ Your obedient Servant, 

^Jno. T. Sueter, 
* Secretary to Vice- Admiral 

^Lord John Hay, C.B. 

* To C. Watkins, Esqre., 
' H.B.M. Consul, Larnaca.' 

« * 

At five p.m. on Friday, July 12, the British 
flag was duly hoisted in Nicosia in the presence 
of Lord John Hay, and of Mr. Walter Baring and 
Sami Pasha, the bearers respectively of a copy 
of the Convention and of the Imperial Ottoman 
Firman; and Lord John Hay assumed the 
administration from Bessim Pasha, the last Turkish 
Governor. On the same day a Commission was 
issued by the Queen, appointing Lieutenant- 
General Sir Garnet (afterwards Viscount) Wolseley 



270 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

to be Her Majesty's High Commissioner and 
Commander-in-Chief in and over the island of 
Cyprus. Sir Garnet, with a force of British and 
Indian troops, landed at Larnaca on July 22, and 
took over from Lord John Hay the government 
of the island. 

With a letter of July 13, wherein Consul 
Watkins acknowledges the receipt of Lord John 
Hay's communication of the previous day, the 
series of archives of the British Consiilates in 
Cyprus comes to an end. Perhaps,' however, 
it will not be out of place to conclude this volume 
with a document which, although well outside 
the period embraced by Ottoman rule in the 
island, bears to that epoch no slight relation. On 
November 5, 19 14, the entry of Turkey into the 
war on the side of the Central Powers severed the 
slender link whereby Cyprus was still attached 
to her Suzerain ; and by an Order in Council, 
issued by the King on that day, the island was 
definitely annexed to the British Dominions : 

'BY THE KING 

* Whereas, by virtue of the Convention of d^ 
fen^ive alliance between Her Majesty Queen 
Victoria and His Imperial Majesty the Sultan 
signed on June the fourth, 1878, the Annex to 
the said Convention signed on July the first, 
1878, and the Agreement signed on behalf of 
Her Majesty and His Imperial Majesty the 
Sultan on August the fourteenth, 1878, His Im- 
perial Majesty the Sultan assigned the Island of 



THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES . 271 

Cyprus to be occupied and administered by 
England upon the terms and conditions specified 
in the said Convention, Annex and Agreement : 

^And whereas, by reason of the outbreak of 
war between His Majesty and His Imperial 
Majesty the Svdtan, the said convention, Annex 
and Agreement have become annulled and are 
no longer of any force or effect : 

'And whereas it has, for the reasons herein- 
before appearing, seemed expedient to His 
Majesty that the said Island should be annexed 
to and should form part of His Majesty's Domin- 
ions, in order that proper provision may be made 
for the government and protection of the said 
Island : 

*Now THEREFORE, His Majesty is pleased by 
and with the advice of His Privy Council, to order 
and it is hereby ordered as follows : 

* I. From and after the date hereof the said 
Island shall be annexed to and form part of His 
Majesty's Dominions and the said Island is 
annexed accordingly. 

' 2. Nothing in this Order* shall affect the 
validity of any instruction issued by His Majesty 
under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet to the 
High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of 
Cyprus, or of any Order in Council affecting 
Cyprus or of any law or proclamation passed or 
issued under any such instructions or order, 
or of any act or thing done under any such 
instructions or order, law, or proclamation, save 
in so far as any provision of any such Order in 
Council, law, or proclamation may be repugnant 



272 THE CONSULAR ARCHIVES 

to the provisions of any Act of Parliament which 
may, by reason of the annexation hereby declared, 
become extended to Cyprus, or to any order or 
regulation made under the authority of any such 
act or having in Cyprus the force and eflPect of 
any such act. 

* 3. His Majesty may from time to time revoke, 
alter, add to, or amend this Order. 

^ 4. This Order may be cited as the Cyprus 
(Annexation) Order in Coimcil, 19 14. 

^ And the Right Honourable Lewis Harcourt, 
one of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of 
State, is to give the necessary directions herein 
accordingly.'
