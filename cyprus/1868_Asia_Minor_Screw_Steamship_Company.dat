\chapter{1868 The Asia Minor Screw Steamship Company}

Captain Bell's Asia Minor Screw Steamship Company operated from Smyrna. This was a British enterprise. 
(Captain John W. Bell resided at Prestwick near Ayr in Scotland.)

The Company conveyed letters between various seaports in the Levant at which the ships touched, 
thus providing a British counterpart to the Russian navigation and Commerce Company and the official  Imperial Ottoman Admiralty Steamship Postal Service. 

The Asia Minor Company seems to have had a special interest in Cyprus, and like the other two it provided its own
adhesive stamps or rather, labels from 1868 onwards.

These labels were cancelled with a straight line Agency hand stamps.

Letters sent from cyprus during the 1860's are rare. However, a fair amount of correspondence exists
from Larnaca and to a lesser extend of Limassol, chiefly connected with the trade of terra-umbra, wines and carobs (or caroubs0.

Occassionally English steamers came from Liverpool or London and these may have brought 'ship letters'.

These labels are extremely rare and Castle notes (page 35), 25 examples of the 1 piastre and 14 of the 2 piastre value were known to exist. The 1 piastre included a vertical pair; of the 2, two are on covers.

These labels come on auction perhaps once every five-ten years. so grab one when you find them.

(The use of the labels at Larnaca is conjectural).
