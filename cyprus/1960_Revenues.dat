##The 1960 Revenues

With the independence the Cyprus republic reverted to the practice, almost universal in mainland Europe of separating
postage and revenue duties. A distinctive series of revenue stamps was produced. These featured the a dove
with a circlet of olive branches and the year of the inauguration of the Republic: 1960.

The Greek lettering reads __hartosimon__ meaning __stamp__ with a fiscal rather than a postal connotation and also the Turkish 'PUL' meaning any kind of stamp and simply
'STAMP' in English. 

The use of __fiscal stamps__ for postage was not sanctioned by the Post Office, but these can sometimes be found.[^1]
