##The 1960 Revenues

With the independence the Cyprus republic reverted to the practice, almost universal in mainland Europe of separating
postage and revenue duties. A distinctive series of revenue stamps was produced. These featured the a dove
with a circlet of olive branches and the year of the inauguration of the Republic: 1960.

The Greek lettering reads __hartosimon__ meaning __stamp__ with a fiscal rather than a postal connotation and also the Turkish 'PUL' meaning any kind of stamp and simply
'STAMP' in English. The Englisht inscription is simply "stamp", but should have probably been written "revenue", but would have probably not fitted in. 

The use of __fiscal stamps__ for postage was not sanctioned by the Post Office, but these can sometimes be found used postally.
