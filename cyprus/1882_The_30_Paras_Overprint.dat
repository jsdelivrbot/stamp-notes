Most used copies appear to have been used at Larnaca or Nicosia.
The remainders were used for accountancy purposes and maybe found (often in quite large blocks) initialed __J.A.B.__
(Mr. J. A.Bulmer was Islnad Postmaster) with or without __Postal Surcharge__ overprint and cancelled at Larnaca in either red or black.
