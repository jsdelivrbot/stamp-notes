\section{The 1880 Overprints}

In 1880 six values of the then current British stamps were overprinted \textsc{CYPRUS} in black, the \halfd. value in a smaller size than the other values.

When these values were replaced by the key-plate issue in 1881, 
the Cyprus Government sold the remainders to Stanley Gibbons.
