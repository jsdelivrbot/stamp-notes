##The Aphrodite Collection

The "Aphrodite" Collection of Cyprus stamps & covers was sold at Spink Auctions in London. The sale realised a fantastic total of &pounds;628,411 with 372 lots coming under the hammer throughout the course of the day.  In a packed room the audience  witnessed the setting of a new world record when the Queen Elizabeth II 1960 Republic Issue stamp, a used 30m. with overprint double, came up for sale.  A bidding war for the item ensued and the hammer fell at &pounds;31,000 (&pounds;35,750 with Buyer's Premium), a world record price for a British Commonwealth Queen Elizabeth II stamp sold at auction.

The sale was a truly global event with bidders participating over the phone, over the internet and in the sale room, including numerous collectors from Cyprus.
The fact that such a high amount has been achieved for a QEII commonwealth stamp is a major breakthrough for QEII Commonwealth stamps
