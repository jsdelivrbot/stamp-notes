##1868 The Asia Minor Screw Steamship Company test

Captain Bel's Asia Minor Screw Steamship Company operated from Smyrna. This was a British enterprise. 
(Captain John W. Bell reside at Prestwick near Ayr in Scotland.)

The Company conveyed letters between various seaports in the Levant at which the ships touched, 
thus providing a British counterpart to the Russian navigation and Commerce Company and the official 
Imperial Ottoman Admiralty Steamship Postal Service. 

The Asia Minor Company seems to have had a special interest in Cyprus, and like the other two it provided its own
adhesive stamps or rather, labels from 1868 onwards.

These labels were cancelled with a straight line Agency hand stamps.

Letters sent from cyprus during the 1860's are rare. However, a fair amount of correspondence exists
from Larnaca and to a lesser extend of Limassol, chiefly connected with the trade of terra-umbra, wines and carobs (or caroubs0.

Occassionally English steamers came from Liverpool or London and these may have brought 'ship letters'.

##Rarity

Castle notes (page 35), used or unused labels are extremely rare. 25 examples of the 1 piastre and 14 of the 2 piastre value were known to exist.
The 1 piastre included a vertical pair; of the 2, two are on covers.

These labels come on auction perhaps once every five-ten years. so grab one when you find them.

(The use of the labels at Larnaca is conjectural).
