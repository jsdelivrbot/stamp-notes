##The Postage Stamps of King Edward VII

King edward VII was enthroned early in 1901. The first Cyprus stamps with the new design did not make an
appearance until 1902 and then only by a few modifications to the key-plate design 
which by now had served for over 22 years.

On the 15th May 1900 the key plate having given 83,000 impressions, De La Rue offered to make a new one at a reduced price. The cost was 
shared between Cyprus, Natal and St.Lucia, but Cyprus alone used it.

There were two definitive series, marked by differences in primarily watermark paper. 
The first issue (1902-1904) used the __Crown CA__ watermark, whereas the second series issue used the __Multiple
Crown C.A.__ watermark.
