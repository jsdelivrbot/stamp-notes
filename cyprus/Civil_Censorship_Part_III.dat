# Cyprus Civil Censorship World War II, 1939-1945 - Part III

###Third Period : February 1942 to August 1945

By the beginning of 1942 the majority of overseas mail was censored and a new type of censorship
handstamp and resealing label was produced in conformity with the British
Empire Censorship System. The earliest recorded date is February 28, 1942.

The new handstamp is the familiar 'tompstone' type, being and Octagonal handstamp, 25x43 struck
in red and occassionally in purplish red, and rarely in black. These are numbered from 1 to 17 and appear to have been used primarily on items where full censorship was necessary.

The resealing label, commonly known to collectors as P.C.90 was issued to conform
with the British Empire Censorship system with the letter 'M' allocated to Cyprus. They number from 1 to 67. The high numbers introduced in 1944. A number of them remain still unrecorded. These are numbers 29, 42, 48 50 and 65. many varieties of these labels exist.



## Unopened Mail
Unopened mail received only the double ring circular censor's handstamp with the number in the middle. At times when a letter was returned to the sender it would receive a second censor's handstamp. The censor mark can be found on all types of letters sometimes with publicity handstamps appearing on the same cover.

###Opened Mail, the resealing-labels.

Together with the handstamp, three types of resealing labels were used on both outgoing and incoming
mail. These labels were:

|Code|Description|
|----|------------|
|L-1 |Normal serified 'R' pre-war resealing label 9same as 1st Period; 72-75 mm height|
|L-2 |re-print of normal serified 'R' L-1 but on narrower strip of paper; width varies, often trimmed to fit th envelope and not to interfere with the writing; The height is 25 mm approximately. It is printed on various types of paper or on obsolete government forms. The text is 75 mm long.
|L-3|Unequal Arms of letter 'E' resealing label. The width varies and is also found trimmed to fit the envelope. The height is 25 mm. Heavier lettering was used than the previous printing. There are two distinct settings of the Royal Crest.

When measuring and examining these resealing labels care should be taken to bear in mind that paper expands when moistened and when glue is applied to it, or when dried glue on paper is moistened for adhesion. bear this in mind when measuring these labels. Due to war conditions and paper shortages all types of paper available were used to make the resealing labels.
