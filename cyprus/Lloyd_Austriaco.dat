\chapter{The Austrian Levant Post Office}

\section{The Lloyd Austriaco}

In 1833, seven insurance companies of Trieste decided to form the Austrian Lloyd Trieste along the lines of Lloyd's of London. Within a short period of its formation, the administration applied to Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria for the privilege of steam navigation with the Levant. On April 20, 1836, the steam-navigation department was introduced and during its second meeting on August 2 of the same year, the  department decided to build six steamships. For this reason, 1836 is considered the year the company was founded. \footnote{Kramer.}


The articles of Association defined the purpose of the Company as being to Link Triest by steamships with the \textit{scali del levante} (ports of call of the Levant).\footnote{other}.

The six paddle steamships were ordered from England and were delivered early 1837. By this time the Company was building the Triest dockyards for the maintenance and repair of the ships and to create a coaling station at planned ports of call.

Ships of the Austrian Lloyd commenced calling in Larnaca in 1837. According to Keith Tranmer in the Austrian
Post Offices Abroad, the Lloyd Agency was opened and is presumed to have dealt with mail. 

The earliest recorded date of the strike of the straight-line handstamp of the Austrian Post Office at Larnaca
is dated 4th April, 1845.
