The key-plate used for the head and frame of the Cyprus 1881 issue was that prepared for four West Indian Colonies in the Leeward group;
a plate of 60 multiples. (Four panes of 6x10). The plate is known as the "Victorian key-plate type". 
Writing in "_Gibbons Stamp Monthly_"
Mr S.C. Crowther Smith observed that the design is often known as the "Cyprus type" an appelation justified by the fact
that in the Protectorate (sic) and there alone, the design was perpetuauted for the haeds of King Edward VII and George V, and was in 
exclusive use from 1881 to 1924 - arecord for any of the key-types... The only non-West Indian example of the type, apart from
Cyprus, is the solidary 2d. value of Natal, 1887-89{{footnote:1}}".  

###Die One

The die from which these first definitive stamps was produced was subsequently replaced. The original condition of
the die is well known to Empire philatelists as Die I. For a considerable time, only
stamps of Die I, were available, but after the introduction of Die II in 1892, stamps
emanating from both dies seem to have been in fairly general use. What renders the stamps of Cyprus first definitive issue comparatively
scarce is the cimbination of Die I and the Crown CC watermark.

###Blocks and Scarcity

In fine mint condition the stamps are very difficult to find, but the 1/2pi. and 2pi. are quite common used
though the 1/2 pi emerald-green is rare on cover. Mint blocks are also rare, but can be found occassionally. the 1/2 pi. and 2pi. exist with watermark inverted. Shade variations occur but these are not
so much a matter of pigment as of intensity of inking.
