\section{Cyprus Civil Censorship World War II, 1939-1945}

Like most countries in the World during World War II, Cyprus had its own civilian censorship of letters
during the Second World War.The main protagonists, both Allies and Axis all instituted postal censorship of civil mails. The largest organisations were those of United Kingdom and the United States who each employed about 10,000 censor staff.

British censorship was mainly based in Aintree (near Liverpool) with nearly 20 other censor stations around the country. Additionally the British ensured censorship control of colonial and dominion mail by instituting an extensive system of censor stations in the following places:

\begin{itemize}
\item Dominions: Australia, Canada, Newfoundland, New Zealand, South Rhodesia and Union of South Africa
\item Colonies: Aden, Antigua, Ascension Island, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Ceylon, Cyprus, Dominica, Egypt, Falkland Islands, Fiji, Gambia, Gibraltar, Gilbert and Ellice Islands, Gold Coast, Gibraltar, Granada, British Guiana, British Honduras, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaya, Malta, Mauritius, Montserrat, New Hebrides, Nigeria, North Borneo, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Palestine, Penang, St. Helena, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent, Sarawak, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, British Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sudan, Tanganyika, Trinidad, Tonga, Uganda, Virgin Islands and Zanzibar.
\end{itemize}

The USA censor staff count rose to 14,462 by February 1943 in the censor stations they opened in New York, Miami, New Orleans, San Antonio, Laredo, Brownsville, El Paso, Nogales, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, San Juan, Charlotte Amalie, Balboa, Cristobal, David, Panama and Honolulu.

Neutral countries like, Ireland, Portugal and Switzerland also performed postal censorship even though they were not directly associated in the conflict.

The best source for information on Cyprus Civilian censorship is a study by The Cyprus Study Circle, issued in May 2004 and written by Alexander C. Ioannides, FRPSL. The notes described in this series of articles are complimentary to the information found in the Study. All the illustrations are from covers of my own collection, unless mentioned otherwise.

\section{Introduction}

On 30 August 1939, two days before the outbreak of World War II, British authorities imposed formal
civil censorship in Cyprus on both outgoing as well as incoming overseas mail.

All mail was routed through the Censor's Office in Nicosia. The implementation of the censorship process was quick and swift as all the lawas and regulations were already into place and operating.
There are no indications that any domestic mail was censored during WWII, although the Governor's orders
in the Cyprus Gazette No. 2749 of 30 August 1939 were not specific about it.

Ioannides divided the Civil Censorship in Cyprus in three chronological periods based on the type
of censorship performed. The three chronological periods are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Period 1: August 1939 to December 1939
\item Period 2: December 1939 to February 1942
\item Period 3: February 1942 to August 1945
\end{enumerate}

The divisions are based on the type of censor mark and or censor label combination used.




\section{First Period : August 1939 to December 1939}

This period can easily be distinguished from the use of the boxed type rectangular censor.

During this period a boxed rectangular handstamp with the words \textsc{PASSED CENSOR} was produced. The dimensions of this handstamp are \\(32x20\\)mm. Ioannides mentions that approximately ten handstamps were used, however, the variations between the handstamps are too minor to identify easily and they are not listed.

Bears various other markings redirecting the cover to Platres where it was received on the 5 September 39. Notable on this cover is also the Larnaca air mail cancellation, which is considered rare.}

\subsection{Unopened Mail}

Originally only a small percentage of mail was censored using the handstamp and a much smaller amount of mail was opened and resealed using resealing labels. For example under instructions from
London no mail from Great Britain was expected to be opened unless there was strong indications of suspicious content. The earliest recorded usage of handstamp C-1 is August 30 1939 and the latest
date 4 December 1939. For such a short period of use many letters have survived and covers with
the rectangular censor mark are fairly easy to find.


The censor mark can be found on all types of letters sometimes with publicity handstamps appearing
on the same cover. The mail mostly originated fromthe UK and the USA.

\section{Opened Mail}

All opened mail was stamped with the Censor handstamp and resealed using the two resealing labels used prior to WWII. 

\subsection{Monetary Exchange Control}

Besides the Censorship measures under Colonial orders any money flowing in and out of Cyprus to countries outside the British empire was to be controlled. In general for security reasons most
of these transactions were sent by registered post. With this order the Cyprus Government declared that all individuals or Companies wishing to remit funds abroad were required to obtain a permit.

The Government went further, for security reasons to discourage the disappearance of monetary documents during the censorship process and ordered that all such mail should bear a note on the outside indicating the content of money and the attached permit.

At first registered letters with money born notes such as \textit{Exchange Control, Certificate enclosed}, which was soon thereafter followed with a handstamp in red \textsc{FOR EXCHANGE CONTROL}. This handstamp, probably due to wear was later modified by removing the left part of it that contained the word \textsc{FOR}. The handstamp
then reading \textsc{EXCHANGE CONTROL} in  a rectangle with the left vertical side now - having been removed- missing. 

The handstamp can be found on both incoming as well as outgoing correspondence.
