\index{Venturini, Franscesco!letters}

Franscesco Venturini was a merchant, ship owner and banker. We know very little of him, but his death was
reported in 1690. The letters addressed to him cover approximately twenty years (1665-87). One of his
early partners was Segni, probably a son of the executor of Bartholomew Corsini.
