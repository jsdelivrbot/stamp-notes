## The Cyprus Postcard

This series of articles on Cyprus Postcards draws heavily on my brother's book, _The Panorama of Cyprus, Picture Postcards of Cyprus 1899-1930_. I am idebted to him for his permission to include material from his collection and book here.

The Cyprus Postcard collector has both good fortune as well as bad fortune. Cyprus being a small impoverished island at the beginning of the twentieth century did not issue a tremendous amount of
postcards as the counterparts in the america's and europe.

While in many countries of the world the postacrd had already had a history of several
decades, it was practically unknown to people in Cyprus, at least until 1901, with the exception 
of travellers and those that received corrspondence from abroad.
