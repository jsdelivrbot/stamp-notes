## Cyprus Civil Censorship World War II, 1939-1945 - Part IV

###Scarcity and Valuation

Ioannides study did not provide any scarcity tables, but from the list of recorded covers one
can get an idea of scarcity of the handstamps and labels. However, as he notes that is only part of the story.

It is virtually impossible to set a price on a cover when so many other factors are concerned and as he notes the price can vary between ten and a thousand pounds (2004).

One importnat fact to remember is that during this time of War there was destruction, hunger and death going on, living under very bad conditions. This mail should be treated with respect. Only a very small percentage of it has survived the catastrophe of War and hunger, at times people took a big sacrifice to come up with the money to send a piece of mail to their loved ones.
