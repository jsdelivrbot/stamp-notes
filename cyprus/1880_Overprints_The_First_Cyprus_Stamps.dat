\section{The 1880 Overprints}
It took almost two years for Cyprus to have its own stamps. 
In 1880 six values of the then current British stamps were overprinted \textsc{CYPRUS} in black, the 1/2d. value in a smaller size than the other values.

When these values were replaced by the key-plate issue in 1881, 
the Cyprus Government sold the remainders to Stanley Gibbons. \footnote{As per Castle.} They have been changing hands ever since.

The first stamp SG1 only two plates were used in Cyprus the Plate 15 and the Plate 19. The Plate 19 is quite rare with Crutwell recording only 24 mint or unused examples of this stamp. If you look carefully below, you can read the plate number
on the example shown.

Note: In "Cyprus 1353-1986, History, Postal History and Postage Stamps", 3rd. Edition, 
published by Robson Lowe 1987, Chris Crutwell, in a section entitled 
"Notes On Some Examples of Cyprus S.G. 1 - Plate 19", 
only records some twenty-four mint or unused examples of this stamp.
