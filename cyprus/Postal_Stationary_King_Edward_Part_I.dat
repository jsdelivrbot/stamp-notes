###King Edward VII Post Cards - Part I, 1902 Issue

These were issued in 1902. They show the head of King Edward VII, as for all the Colonies at the time.
One characteristic of these cards is that there is no dividing line at the back.

The first issue was that of King Edward VII in green. The post card can be found quite easily both in unused as well as used condition and also marked SPECIMEN.
