##The Postage Stamps of King George V

###The Shield Type Stamps


The reason for this issue was the new combination of postal and revenue duties. The stamps are inscribed 
(POSTAGE & REVENUE) and are sometimes called the postage and revenue key-plate design.

The design was again of the key-plate type but this time the "SHIELD TYPE" was adopted, a sober and unispired
portrait stamp in which King George's head appears in a shield-shaped frame between tablets to the left and right reading "POSTAGE"
and "REVENUE" respectively with the usual duty labels at top and bottom.

__Unlike the previous key-plate design, this was not used in any other Colony.__

Colour Proof trials, took place and some are shown in the images below. They exceedingly rare, but occassionally
show up at auction. I was lucky to obtain one and then waited for almost ten years to buy the set below.

###The Five Pound stamp

When this stamp was issued in 1928 it was a surprise as it was the highest value ever printed in Cyprus. Its postal use before the era of heavy
registered packets by air must have been limited to such an extend that it can hardly ever have been used genuinely
to frank posts. Specimens that have obviously been cancelled by favour do exist. It must be regarded primarily as a revenue stamp.
