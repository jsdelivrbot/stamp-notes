\chapter{Introduction to Cyprus Postal History}

Cyprus is a small island\footnote{Third largest in size.} in the eastern Meditteranean and it happens to be the place where I was born, so I have a particularly soft spot for it. \cite{options} 

The first mails were privately carried and delivered and some have survived form the 1300s. Later mail are to be found from Venetian and other sources. Many of these letters have now disappeared into "Bank Collections." Both Cyprus Bank as well as Laiki have build collections as part of "giving back to the community"  and "social responsibility strategies". The former has invested badly in Greek bonds\footnote{See introduction} and a disastrous investment in Russia, where the latter made similar bad investments. With some luck some bright white knight will sell these collections and the items can get back into the collector's market.


##Lloyds Austriaco

Like many of the Levant countries, the Lloyds Austriaco made a stop at Larnaka and these letters are coveted both by collectors of Cyprus or the Austrian Levant posts. These covers are both expensive and very almost impossible to find unless a major collection appears in the market. During this period two handstamps were used the straight line \textsc{"larnacca"} and the \textsc{"larnaca de cipro"}. 

The British period started on the 12th of July 1878 with Colonel Greaves posting the \url{/cyprus/1878_The_British_Period}.  
Like in many other British Colonies firstly stamps of Great Britain were used. In 1881 a set of provisionals was issued and these were later followed with the first stamps of Cyprus bearing the Queen Victoria portrait.

Luckily for collector's the remainders of most of the provisional stamps were purchased by Stanley Gibbons and some of them have survived in fairly large blocks and are still reasonably priced as compared to similar issued from other Colonies.

During the four Kings period\footnote{King Edward VII, KIng George V, King Edward VIII, King George VI.} there is not much of interest, especially in stamps as the varieties are almost unique and impossible to purchase. 

Some interesting postmarks of this period relate to the Cyprus Government Railway which operated at the time. My first encounter with these was when -- after setting up a small approval business with a friend during our high-school years -- a Mr. Hutchinson wrote to us to inquire if we had any covers with railway marks. We duly wrote back that Cyprus had no railway. As most philatelist do he patiently wrote a letter with some very educational material. We mostly traded in c.t.o stamps that we bought from Rosen \& Sons in sheets and sold them on approval. These were mostly from the Gulf states, Eastern Europe and China. I feel much better now, knowing that who ever bought from us can look forward to making a good profit, especially from the Chinese issues. Even the Gulf States such as Sharjah, Ajman,  Umm al Quain and Qatar and Yemen are trading very well on ebay.

However, the First World and Second World War have resulted is some interesting covers. For a short period after the War II, Jewish "refugees" were interned in Cyprus before being sent to Palestine and a bit of "Jewish Refugee Mail" has survived. There are also interesting array of F.P.O, including the "Indian Forces in Cyprus."

Cyprus only managed to see one set of definitives during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. In this period some mail was censored, which has produced two new marks. As Cyprus was the base station for British and French Forces that invaded Egypt during the Suez crisis, of interest are some covers of this period. 

British FPO have been stationed on the island since 1878 and are still stationed in two sovereign areas (Dekhelia and Akrotiri) and they form an interestinf Postal history section of Cyprus.

During the republic period the intercommunal troubles ended up with the UN sending  a Peace keeping force for what was supposed to be a short period. This short period is currently over 50 years! In this period the UNFICYP has used stamps of their own countries, so Cyprus not only prints its stamps in three official languages, but has covers with stamps of other countries "used abroad" from Sweden, Finalnd, Canada, Ireland and many others which can't remember now.


The modern stamps of Cyprus are beautifully printed and although I disagree with some of the issues that target the "topical" collectors the number of sets printed in any year are reasonable. Some of the maximum cards compete with the best of other countries.

A basic Cyprus Collection can be started with a very low budget and some Postal History areas are inexpensive compared to other Countries. For the serious collector there are so many unique or limited covers, especially from the 19th Century that hunting for them can take  a lifetime. 

In this website we cover many countries and many topics, but you will find very little information on "Northern Cyprus" or "Turkish Cyprus". This is not of disrespect to the Turkish Cypriots and their long history and sufferings. 

I don't wish to get into the polemics of both sides and I wish a solution could be found to-morrow, but until such time that I get a reasonable explanation as to why Turkey has turned the beautiful city of Famagusta into a ghost town and still keeps it as such, I will not spent even one cent on buying anything philatelic from "North Turkey" or encourage you with my writings to do so.

There is a strong Cyprus Study Circle which meets regularly and has produced some outstanding publications and which I encourage you to join. There is also some good philatelic literature relating to Cyprus such as the Rev. Castle's book "The Stamps and Postal History of Cyprus", Podger's Revenues\cite{Podger, R. Cyprus Revenues.} and Frankoudis catalogue and book on Stationary. These are listed in the literature section.

Many of the images and items posted in this section are unique and I have attempted to record in colour the breadth of Cyprus philately. If you happen to have purchased some of the items shown here, I would appreciate your further input to expand the write-up and perhaps provide a few additional images to enhance the articles.
