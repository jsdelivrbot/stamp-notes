1928, started a new era for Cyprus with the arrival of __Sir Ronald Storrs, K.C.M.G., C.B.E.__, as the new Governor.
Storrs arved with H.M.S. _Cornflower_ in Famagusta on the 30th of November, 1926. Although not liked by the Cyprus
population he was by nature a historian and an artist. He had a deep affection for the Island, its history treasures
and its people. He recounted in his book "_Orientations_", determnied to rescue Cyprus from its position as
the "Cinderella of the Colonies", saving it from "short-sighted and uneconomic cheese-paring",
"misfits" and "incompetents", thsu giving Cyprus a prestige which it badly required.

Sir Ronald Storrs took a special interest in teh Postal department. With effect from 1st July, 1927, the title
of "Island Postamster" was abolished and the head of the Postal department became "Postmaster General". Mr L.J.E. Densch
was the First Postmaster General.

As the fifieth anniversary of the second "English" Occupation approached, the Governor determined, after consultation with the
Colonial Office, to extract from the Jubilee something of that publicity which the Colony so sorely needed.

The advent of the commemorative stamps was announced in the "Cyprus Gazette" of the 20th January, 1928, as about
to take place on the 1st of February:

__As Castle points out, the stamps anticipated the actual date of the event commemorated by six months__.
