A Country Post Office that has aroused most interest is Kilani in the Limassol District, the capital of a 
sub-district. Castle notes that two cancellers were sent out from London on the 27th August, 1897 - a brass stamp
for the Rural Service mail - of which more anon- and a circular date stamp (the proof impression shows, only, "KILANI CYPRUS"
within the circle but some "small packets of type" went by the same despatch of stores for Cyprus).
