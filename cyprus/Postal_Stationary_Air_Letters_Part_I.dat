###Air Letters

The first pre-printed {{wi:air_letter}} forms appeared in Cyprus in 1944 with an added 4 1/2 Piastre stamp for the rate. It was only after the War in 1946 that the Cyprus air letters with the imprinted 4 1/2 Piastre value were printed by McCorquodale and available for use.

All air letters with the value imprinted were made by McCorquodale up to the st. Sophia church issue of 1967. It does not appear that the precise dates of issue have been recorded.

The aerogram was largely popularised by its use during the Second World War (1939-45), after Lieutenant Colonel R. E. Evans, Royal Engineers, Assistant Director Army Postal Service Middle East Force (MEF), proposed that a lightweight self-sealing letter card that weighed only 1/10 oz be adopted by the British Army for air mail purposes. He recommended its use to Sir Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War during his visit to the Middle East, in late 1940. By January the following year, General Archibald Percival Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief, MEF was told by Eden that "Your Assistant Director Army Postal Services may forthwith introduce an Air Mail Letter Card Service for the Middle East. Use British stamps from all countries, including Egypt."

On 1 March 1941, the air mail service between the Middle East and the UK was started, using a combination of Imperial Airways seaplanes and military transport. The private nature of the air letter ensured its popularity among its users and that popularity, with its lightness, brought about its continued use as today's civilian air letter (aerograms) and the British military "bluey".

The production of United States aerograms has ceased, and when the stock of aerograms has been depleted, including the current USPS 60\cent Voyageurs National Park aerogram that is still on sale, it will not be reprinted.1 

###Caring for Air Letters

Air letters are fragile items. They tend to tear easily and the paper becomes brittle. Most collectable ones are already 60 years old. If they will last as long as postage stamps from the Victorian times is very unlikely.
