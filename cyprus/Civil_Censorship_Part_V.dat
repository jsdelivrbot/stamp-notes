\section{Scarcity and Valuation}

\lettrine{I}{oannides} study did not provide any scarcity tables, but from the list of recorded covers one
can get an idea of scarcity of the handstamps and labels. However, as he notes that is only part of the story.

One important fact to remember is that during the time that censorship of mail was in place
it was a time of War; there was destruction, hunger and death going on, living under very bad conditions. This mail should be treated with respect. Only a very small percentage of it has survived the catastrophe of War and hunger, at times people took a big sacrifice to come up with the money to send a piece of mail to their loved ones. Many other cherished these letters and kept them until the next generation consented to part with them.
