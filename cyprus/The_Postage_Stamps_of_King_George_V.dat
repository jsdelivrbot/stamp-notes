##The Postage Stamps of King George V

With the death of King Edward, the standard head of the King was substituted for that of his father thus avoiding the preparation
of new fresh duty plates.

The 5 paras value was not repeated in the new set and the 9, 18 and 45 piastre values did not appear until three
years after the others.

The broken 'U' variety on the 9 piastre stamp was not corrected but the two defective 'S' varities of the 
1/2 piastre values were. The repairs were done in 1905. (Castle 171).





###1921-1923 The Second Definitive Georgian key-plate Stamps (multiple script watermark)

The increased rates of postage to the United Kingdom and other areas came into effect in December 1921. To meet these changes new stamps
were issued in new colours during December 1921.

These stamps were issued in very small quantities (3017 for 10 shillings and 1682 for the &pound; 1. They were invalidated on the
1st August, 1951 and it has been stated that the remainders were burned on that day.

The duties to be performed by fiscal stamps were regulated by the Stamp law of 1923. Under this law ordinary postage stamps were available for fiscal use
only when the duty did not exceed two piatsres. In later years, however, high value postage stamps were extensively used for fiscal purposes, and still later exclusively so,
until the end of British rule in 1960.

They were printed on paper with the new watermark - Multiple Crown Script C.A - with three high value exceptions. this
paper was to become standard in all future issues for as long as the island was under British rule.


##The Shield Type Stamps

The reason for this issue was the new combination of postal and revnue duties. The stamps are inscribed 
(POSTAGE & REVENUE) and are sometimes called the postage and revenue key-plate design.

###The Five Pound stamp
When this stamp was issued in 1928 it was a surprise as it was the highest value ever printed in Cyprus. Its postal use before the era of heavy
registered packets by air must have been limited to such an extend that it can hardly ever have been used genuinely
to frank posts. 9cancelled to order specimens do exist though). It must be regarded primarily as a revenue stamp.

Blocks are exceedingly rare. There was one in the V.H.Richardson Sale in 1960 and re-appeared in the market in 2005. I have a feeling that this sort of bock ends up in some "investment portfolio." Predictably paying heavy auctioneers fees to buy it and then sell it most probably ends up in a loss.
