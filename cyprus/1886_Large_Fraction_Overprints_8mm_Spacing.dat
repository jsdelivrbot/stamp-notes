###May 1886: The Large Fractions



__TYPE III__ The overpint fractions are 12mm high and 8mm apart. the overprint was applied by typography locally
and was generally poorly executed. There are many varieties of broken figures in addition to te varieties listed by Stanley
Gibbons. The overprint was applied, to complete panes of 60. The earliest date is 25th May 1886 and examples can be found as late as May 1887. It is noticeable that the earliest
dates appaer on stamps on C.C. paper.

The official reason for the overpint was the Island Postmaster's insistence that the colours being easily changed to blue
and the printed value apt to be obscured by the cancellation, the value should be evident _during the press of work sorting_.

\subsection{Varieties}

(a) Large __1__ in left hand fraction, listed as SG 28a and SG 29a. There are two distinct types of 
this variety; in one the
figure __1__ is taller than usual, in the other the __1__ is much thicker than usual. The R.P.S.
gives certificates for both types.
This has been recorded used 29th May, 1887.

(b) Small __1__ in right-hand fraction, listed as SG 28b and SG 29b. 

(c) Overpint grossly misplaced, resulting in one overprint being omitted or just falling on the perforations.

(d) Overprint double. The left hand fraction has an extra __1/2__ 2mm to the left of it. It is difficult to
see how this variety could have occured.

(e) large two at right

The overprints can be found both on watermark C.C. paper as well as C.A., they are listed by Stanley Gibbons as SG 28 and SG 29 respectively.


##The August 1886 10 mm Spacing

Castle page 117, discusses what _appears to be_ another setting __TYPE IV__. In this _setting_ the fractions appear to
be 10mm apart, rather than the 8mm spacing. Dated copies show August to Novemeber dates. The type is often defective.
The wider spacing was due, states Mr. A.L.Pemberton, to shifting type:

<blockquote>
I had three copies with identical fractions hsowing three different spacings.
</blockquote>

Castle states that a copy exists with A R.P.S. certificate stating that _it is genuine 
but the overprint is not from a different setting_. A similar copy but with a B.P.A. certificate states 
that _the abnormal distance between the fractions is caused by loose type_.

After August, 1886 the use of the unoverprinted 1/2 piastre dull green, first supplied in April 1883,
became general.

__Few forgeries of the surcharge exist on the C.A. paper and virtually all are on the dull 
green shade, for the excellent reason that the emerald shade is quite rare without the overprint. 
Fournier made one poor effort which can easily be spotted.__
