\chapter{The Larnacca de Cipro Cancellation}

The straight line stamp appears to have been replaced sometime in 1865 with the single circle
type. The date is in two lines, struck in reddish 
brown (most common) "blackish brown" and also in black and blue. Most of the times the impression is 'oily'. It can be found both on envelopes with adhesives as well as envelopes with no postage stamps on.

On adhesives the cancellation can be considered as rare, especially 
on multiples like the envelope illustrated above. It is rather more 
easily found on unstamped covers.
