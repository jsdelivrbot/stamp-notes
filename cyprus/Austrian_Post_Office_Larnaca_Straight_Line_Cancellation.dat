\section{The Straight Larnaca cancellation}

The use of adhesives did not commence until 1st June 1864. 
Between 1845 and 1864 covers exist with handstruck
stamps. Such covers are scarce. The earliest recorded date of the strike of the straight-line handstamp of the Austrian Post Office at Larnaca
is dated 4th April, 1845.
