\section{May 1882: The Small Fractions}

A concerned postmaster for his illiterate customers and poor light in the the post office has produced one of the most
interesting issue of the Island. The official reason for the overpint was the Island Postmaster's insistence that the colours being easily changed to blue
and the printed value apt to be obscured by the cancellation, the value should be evident \textit{during the press of work sorting}.

The stamps of this issue are known as the \textit{small fractions} to distinguish them from the ones that followed termed the \textit{large fractions}.

TYPE I The overpint is 7-7 1/2 mm high and 13-13 1/2 mm apart. the overpint was applied
by lithography at the Government Printing Office, Nicosia, on panes of 60 stamps, a horizontal
set-up of 12 fractions (on six stamps) being repeated ten times. There are minor differences in the fractions
which enable any stamp to be positioned within the row. Horizontal strips of six stams exist, showing the
complete setting (illustrated in Castle page 115).

The stamps were overpinted on SG23 and SG25, the difference being the first one was on CC paper and the latter
on CA paper.

A number of varieties exist, from double overprint, double overpint, misplacements and verical pairs 
with the one missing.

I have a double overprint which used to be in Mr. C.G.Constantinides collection that the certificate states that \textit{it is genuine but not a double surcharge}. The left fraction just looks thicker!
