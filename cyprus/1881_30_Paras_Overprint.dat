The internal rate of postage was one penny for a letter of 1/2 ounce. this was proposed to be reduced to 1/2 piastre (2/3d) on the arrival of new stamps.
It was therefore decided to overprint the existing stocks with 30 paras. (40 paras made one piastre).

It was suggested by many authorities on the subject that the 30 PARAS was required for soldier's and sailor's letters

large blocks of plates of 201 and 216 exist unused, and smaller blocks of the other plates are known.

Accoding to V H Richardson, the overprint was applied in two blocks of 120. Slight variations of the type
occur, the most prominent being the closing of the open ends of _3_ in _30_ so that it appears as _80_.
This is recorded on plate 216 FA.
