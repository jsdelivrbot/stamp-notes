\section{1894-96 The Cyprus Postage Stamps of Queen Victoria}
\subsection{1894-96 Colours Changed}

We have mentioned earlier that a colour change became necessary and this anticipated colour change began in 1894. It provided Cyprus with a most attractive definitive issue in two colours.

In stamp catalogues the high values follow the low value bi-coloured stamps but as 
Castle notes the postal historian should place them in chronological order.

Like most Colonial stamps of the times some rare essays survived and were present in the early great collections. They tend to change hands every thirty or so years if not longer and this is the case for the ones shown here. 

The essays expressed in the Sterling currency followed the key-plate design used for the Leeward Islands and Seychelles. Eventually
it was decided to issue the three stamps in piastres rather than the Sterling currency. With the solidary exception
of the King george V 10/- value of the 1922-3 issue piastre denominations remained the rule for all values
under \pound;1 until the intorduction of decimal
currency in 1955.

It must be noted that United Kingdom currency (silver coinage) was still in use. The copper coinage for
Cyprus consisiting of 1/4, 1/2 and 1 piastres pieces, first minted in 1879, was still being supplemented by British coins. Not until 1901 did Cyprus silver coins inscribed in piastre denominations appeared.

The essay shown on the left appaers to be the one originally in the Richardson Collection and subsequently in 
the "Aphrodite Collection."

The set is not difficult to obtain and some minor varieties have been recorded. It always amazes me when people look for minor variations on printing and overprints on something which is almost impossible to plate.
