##The Cyprus Austrian Post Office

Ships of the Austrian Lloyd commenced calling in Larnaca in 1837. According to Keith Tranmer in the Austrian
Post Offices Abroad, the Lloyd Agency was opened and is presumed to have dealt with mail. 

The earliest recorded date of the strike of the straight-line handstamp of the Austrian Post Office at Larnaca
is dated 4th April, 1845.
