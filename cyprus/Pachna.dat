### Pachna

Pachna (Pakhna, &#928;&#940;&#967;&#957;&#945;) is a village in the Limassol District of the Republic of Cyprus. It is situated on the south slopes of the Troodos mountain range at an altitude of 745 m (2447 ft).

The name Pachna is thought to originate from the ancient Greek word &#960;&#940;&#967;&#957;&#951; (pachni) which relates to the morning white frost found on leaves following a chilly night. Another explanation could come from the alternative meaning of &#960;&#940;&#967;&#957;&#951;, a manger, in reference to its protected location amidst the surrounding high hills. During the Frankish and Venetian occupations of Cyprus the village appeared on maps under the name of Padena.

Population 865.
