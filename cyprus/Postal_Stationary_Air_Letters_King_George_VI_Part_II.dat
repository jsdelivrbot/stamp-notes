###Identying the Air Letters

These early air letters are sometimes difficult to identify. Authors such as A.Ioannides and C.Podger use the following identification marks to distinguish the air letters during the reign of King George VI.

- The absence of a pre-printed stamp
- The absence or existence of a watermark
- small differences in the lettering and length of various marks.

Fortunately with better printing techniques Queen elizabeth air letters and those of the Republic can easily be identified with a reference to a catalogue or a specialist publication.

###Caring for Air Letters

Air letters are fragile items. They tend to tear easily and the paper becomes brittle. Most collectable ones are already 60 years old. If they will last as long as postage stamps from the Victorian times is very unlikely.

Magnified stamp on Cyprus air letter. Use the size of the width and height for the stamp to narrow down the type of air-letter.

Although the size of the stamp can vary quite considerably and thus can be used as an identifying mark, one should remember that paper as it ages can shrink considerably when dried.
