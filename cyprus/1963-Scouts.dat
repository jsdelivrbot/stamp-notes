The Scouts Miniature sheet was the first to be issued in Cyprus. This sheet consisted of all the three stamps,
imperforate with simulated perforations. The total face value of the stamps was 173 mils, but the sheets sold for 250 mils, the difference covered a donation to the Boy Scouts of Cyprus. (a donation of stamps to the value
of &pound; 2,000 was also made). 
An interesting fact is that the supply of the miniature sheets was exhausted on the first day of issue.

The miniature sheet can be found fairly easily on FDC.
