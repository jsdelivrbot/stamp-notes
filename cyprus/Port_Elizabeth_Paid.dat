### Port Elizabeth Paid and topay

In December 1852 the Port Elizabeth post office was issued with two datestamps. The format of these datestamps was a single-lined oval with the name of the town on top, a date in the middle and either 'PAID' or 'TO-PAY' at the bottom.

Forgeries are knowm and Goldblatt warns against purchasing covers with strikes showing dates of "August 24" or "May 27".

It is of interest to note that in the whole of the Cape of Good Hope only Cape Town and Port Elizabeth were issued with datestamps at this stage. With the advent of the Cape Triangular Stamps on the 1st of September 1853 the need to use these handstamps fell away.
