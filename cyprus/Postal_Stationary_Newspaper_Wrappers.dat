###Newspaper Wrappers



The Post Office Cyprus started issuing Newspaper Wrappers from 1880. The first wrappers was the Great britain one overprinted with "Cyprus". Although most Cyprus wrappers are found very easily, it is a mystery that this first
wrapper is not known used or maybe only 2-3 have survived used.

These first wrappers were delivered to somerset House on November 10, 1879. The original quote by De La Rue
to print the 1d. Newspaper Warppers was given to the Inland Revenue on July 31, 1879. The wrappers were printed by hand from a small frame and banded in Cyprus bands. 

This first issue has also produced to constant 'boken inner white circle' varieties. You can see
both varieties below and are large ones to be easily seen with the naked eye.
