## Cyprus Civil Censorship World War II, 1939-1945 - Part II

###Second Period : December 1939 to February 1942

The rapidly changing conditions of the War and the entry of Italy a much greater amount of mail
was censored during this period. A new double ring circular handstamp, denoted as __C-2__, with
a censor number in the middle, from 1-41, always impressed in red replaced the previously used
rectangular one.

Certain censor numbers can be found with initials. When a letter was opened a resealing label was used. Four different labels were used and these are discussed a bit later.

{{pinnote:Censor numbers 11, 12, 14, 15, 17 and 37 still remain unrecorded. Please be on the look-out and if you find one, please send us a scan.}}



###Unopened Mail

Unopened mail received only the double ring circular censor's handstamp with the number in the middle. At times when a letter was returned to the sender it would receive a second censor's handstamp. The censor mark can be found on all types of letters sometimes with publicity handstamps appearing on the same cover.

###Opened Mail, the resealing-labels.

Together with the handstamp, three types of resealing labels were used on both outgoing and incoming
mail. These labels were:

|Code|Description|
|----|------------|
|L-1 |Normal serified 'R' pre-war resealing label 9same as 1st Period; 72-75 mm height|
|L-2 |re-print of normal serified 'R' L-1 but on narrower strip of paper; width varies, often trimmed to fit th envelope and not to interfere with the writing; The height is 25 mm approximately. It is printed on various types of paper or on obsolete government forms. The text is 75 mm long.
|L-3|Unequal Arms of letter 'E' resealing label. The width varies and is also found trimmed to fit the envelope. The height is 25 mm. Heavier lettering was used than the previous printing. There are two distinct settings of the Royal Crest.

When measuring and examining these resealing labels care should be taken to bear in mind that paper expands when moistened and when glue is applied to it, or when dried glue on paper is moistened for adhesion. bear this in mind when measuring these labels. Due to war conditions and paper shortages all types of paper available were used to make the resealing labels.
