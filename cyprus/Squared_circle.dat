\subsection{Squared Circle Postmarks}

One of the most popular postmark in Great Britain and its Colonies was the "experimental" squared circle postmarks. The Post Office always looking for ways to save costs introduced them to serve the dual purpose of a datestamp as well as a defacer. The handstamp was issued to all the major towns and a few of the larger villages. It remained in use for many years.
