# An Introduction to the Stamps and Postal Histry of Niue

The Island of Niue (or 'savage Island') is  country in the South Pacific Ocean. It is commonly known as the "Rock of Polynesia", and inhabitants of the island call it "the Rock" for short. Niue is 2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) northeast of New Zealand in a triangle between Tonga to the southwest, the Samoas to the northwest, and the Cook Islands to the southeast. The land area is 260 square kilometres (100 sq mi) with about 1,400 people who are predominantly Polynesian. The Island was also discovered by Captain Cook on his second voyage (20 June 1774). He did not do much exploration, as he thought the inhabitants very savage; In his book \textit{Vikings of the Pacific}, Peter Buck tells about his own years at Niue; one Niuan told him that they were very cross with Captain Cook for the name 'Savage Island', saying 'One of my ancestors really threw a spear from a distance but he never hit anything!' Their body tattoos, however, may have added to the impression of unfriendliness: by ll counts the Niuns, are now known as very friendly people.

The islanders firmly declined to be part of [Cook Islands](../cook-islands/Introduction), and have maintained a separate status under New Zealand supervision since 1902. They acquired self-government status in 1974. Niue's  stamp-issuing policy has not been quite as aggressive as that of Cook Islands, but the later issues can only be described as "wallpaper stamps", if not labels.


\section{First stamps}

The first stamps of Niue, issued on 4 January 1902. They were overprints of then-current New Zealand stamps. The quality of overprinting was extremely poor and resulted in many varieties. Given the limited facilities of New Zealand's government printer at the time and the fact, that they were stamps for an island colony and they felt that getting it done as cheaply and quickly as possible was more important than quality and finish. The stamps were meant to do a job and nothing else.


The first stamps inscribed "Niue" were the 1920 pictorial series.

\subsection{Modern issues}

Niue stamps are now issued on a regular basis.

The Niue Philatelic and Numismatic Company, established by the Niue Philatelic and Numismatic Act 1996, was established "to administer philatelic, numismatic and other revenue earning options and services."[2] Stamps are currently issued on behalf of this company by New Zealand Post, and are sold at face value through the New Zealand Post web site.[3] 

\section{2011 Royal Wedding}

In 2011, Niue was forced to defend a pair of stamps issued for the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton that split the royal couple when the stamps were separated for use.[4] See figure \ref{two}.

Collecting the stamps and postal history of these former dependencies or protectorates (call them what you will) of New Zealand brings much pleasure, perhaps with the exception of modern issues.
