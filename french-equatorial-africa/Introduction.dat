History

Established in 1910, the federation contained five territories : [French Congo](../french-congo/introduction) and Gabon, [Oubangui-Chari](../ubangi-shari/introduction), [Chad](../chad/introduction) and French Cameroon (after World War I), although the last was not organized as a separate entity until 1920. The Governor-General was based in Brazzaville with deputies in each territory.

In 1911, France ceded parts of the territory to German Kamerun as a result of the Agadir Crisis. The territory was returned after Germany's defeat in World War I, while Cameroon proper became a French League of Nations mandate not integrated into the AEF.

During the late 1920s and early 1930s an anti-colonial movement Soci&#233;t&#233; Amicale des Originaires de l'A.E.F. was established by Andr&233; Matsoua,[1] seeking French citizenship for the territory's inhabitants.[2]

During World War II, the federation rallied to the Free French Forces under  F&#233;lix &#201;bou&#233; in August 1940, except for Gabon which was Vichy French between 16 June 1940 and 12 November 1940; the federation became the strategic centre of Free French activities in Africa.

Under the Fourth Republic (1946-58), the federation was represented in the French parliament. When the territories voted in the September 1958 referendum to become autonomous within the French Community, the federation was dissolved. In 1959 the new republics formed an interim association called the Union of Central African Republics, before becoming fully independent in August 1960.
