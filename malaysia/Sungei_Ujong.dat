##Sungei Ujong



Sungei Ujong was a very small State situated on th banks of the Linggi river on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula. Now known as Seremban was originally founded as Sungei Ujong (or Sungai Ujong), named after a nearby river of the same name. While the town was renamed Seremban afterwards, the Sungai Ujong name most prominently persists as a street name for a road adjoining the southern side of town (Sungai Ujong Road, or Jalan Sungai Ujong).
The town is also referred alternately as "Fu Yong" (Chinese: 芙蓉) among the Chinese-speaking community, although the name is not recognised officially.

Sungai Ujong came into existence with the discovery of tin ore in the 1870s like most major towns in Peninsular Malaysia. The discovery of tin in a nearby area called Rasah, saw an influx of Arab, Malay and Chinese immigrants to work on the mines and trade there. Most of the local Malays were farmers.

Renamed to Seremban, the town flourished not only as a mining area but also a business centre. The Linggi River served as the sole outlet to ferry tin and supplies in and out of the town. Revenue came not only from tin trade but also from the large amount of taxes collected, much to the displeasure of the traders and the British colonialists at the neighbouring port of Malacca.

The local chieftains, namely the Dato' Kelana and the Dato' Shahbandar of Sungai Ujong were at odds with each other on the rights to collect taxes and ownership and control of the mines. The rivalry to assert influence and authority opened the door for British intervention in Negeri Sembilan. The British sided with the Dato’ Kelana upon invitation and defeated the forces of the Dato’ Bandar who was later sent into exile to Singapore. In a show of gratitude to the British for helping him win the war, the Dato' Kelana had no choice but to accept a British Resident whose job was to advise him on matters other than religion and Malay customs.

Captain Murray was appointed the first resident and later set-up his residence at Channer Road, now renamed Jalan Dato' Siamang Gagap. Soon after, the people living around Rasah moved to Channer Road for the sake of security and its orderly administration.

On April 21st, 1874, it entered into a Bond the conditions of which were \textit{inter alia} the good government of the territory; the free passage of the river and that taxes put on navigation of teh river are to be "with the sanction and approval of the Government of the Straits Settlements."

In September 1874,  a small  force of European troops and native police entered Sungei Ujong and captured a fort. Captain Tatham, R.A. was let in charge with a guard to "advise" the Dato Klana of Sungei Ujong. In December of the same year a force of Gurghas and light artillery had to be despatched from Penang. These operations were successful and by 1876 a general settlement was reached. 



###1878 Overprints on Straits Settlements Stamps
In 1878 a special stamp was provided for Sungei Ujong for use on letters addressed to the Straits Settlements or other Native Satte. This was the Straits Settlements 2 cents, brown CC, which was overprinted with the device shown in Figure~\ref{SU}.

The first mention of the postage stamp in the philatelic press was in the \textit{Philatelic Record} of March, 1880 (Vol II, p.16), when a letter from teh European Secretary to the Maharajah of Johore was quoted as stating that Johore, Perak and some other Malay native States had used for a short period the 2 cents surcharged with a Star and Crescent. The magazine followed up the story in their February 1881 edition (Vol. III, p.6), stating that:

\begin{quotation}
In March 1880, we referred to a stamp of which we have heard, but never seen at that time; viz., the 2 cents Straits Settlements, surcharged with a Star and Crescent, for use in the states of the neighbouring potentates. This stamp, of the surcharge on which we annex an engaving, appears to have been obsolete for some time. It was sent to us by one of the BRitish official as a curiosity; but our correspondent, with the charming \textit{insouciance} so characteristic of the unphilatlic; did not deign to say whether it was used in Johore, Perak, Elswhere, or in all three places. Can the latter "S.U." have anything to do with Sunda? The surcharge is in black.
\end{quotation}

The mystery was solved in the issue for September 1881, page 147, when it was stated on good authority that the surcharge stood for---Sungei Ujong.

The overprint has teh letters "S.U." in large thick capitals, surmounted by a Crescent and Star, the whole being enclosed in a broad lined oval measuring 18x15.25mm. It was applied by mens of a handstamp to one stamp at a time. It is found occassionally on stamps with the wing margin. It is unclear how the stamps were sold or cancelled, but copies of the stamp with manuscript cancellations exist (see Figure~\ref{SUcancelled}), as well as with the Malacca B/172 obliterator. The latter appeared in a Spinks auction 8013 and described  Fine Stamps & Covers of South East Asia 
as  lightly cancelled with Malacca "B/172" obliterator; top right corner defective. The stamp had  R.P.S. certificate dated (1917) and a B.P.A. (2002) Certificates. S.G. 1, £3250. Photo Estimate S$ 1,000-1,200 Sold for SG$800. 

P. C. Pratti writing in the London Philatelist (LP0893) noted: `that he have never seen or recorded even a pair of Sungei Ujong. This is important because, of the many specimens and photographs I have been able to
study, only two had precisely the same measurements. To a great extent, of course, this is
due to varied inking and pressure of the handstamp; but some copies differ noticeably in
the shape, size and relative position of the symbols. Here we must recall the words of Douglas
Garth stating, as one who knew, that a double die was used, resulting in two impressions
would certainly differ from each other. Can one imagine Mr Garth making so definite a
claim if he had no reason to believe it true? Though he seems to have been wrong in the case
of Perak, if these overprints were made by the individual States, it is not surprising that the
idea of a time- and labour-saving device should not have occurred to the first producer but
might well do so to those who followed. The number of very similar, but not identical, prints
one meets with in the case of Sungei Ujong, certainly tends to bear out his assertion. All
these are now termed forgeries, only those identical with Wm. Brown's illustration being
accepted as genuine. It is doubtful if any further progress can be made until either a cover or horizontal pair turns up.

\end{marginfigure}

Further confusion is caused by the half anna blue of the East India Company, being
found overprinted with the same device. The Philatelic Record for December, 1882, Vol.
IV, page 207, reports a meeting of the Philatelic Society of London on 16th December of
that year:
'On conclusion of the business,... were shown. Also a •£ anna blue India surcharged
in black for use in Sungei Ujong with a crescent and star and the letters "S.U." within
an oval. The type of surcharge is that illustrated in the Philatelic Record for September
1881, page 147.' (On the 2 cents brown.)
Once more we have an instance of a stamp accepted as genuine a very few years after its
presumed appearance, with no fresh evidence either way, being subsequently termed 'bogus';
a facile description of anything not met with in quantity. Once more, too, it is still accepted
as a genuine emission in some countries. As with the other crescent and star overprints, no
official correspondence has been found, so the verdict can only be based on 'philosophical
probability' and this is very difficult to assess. Wm. Brown gives an illustration of the accepted forgery on the ^ anna; I have a similar
one on the 2 cents brown. I have also two copies of the % anna with this overprint; one, a
used copy which resembles, but is not identical with Wm. Brown's illustration (and of
which I do not much like the cancellation) and the other, unused, resembling fairly closely
the normally accepted overprint, but not exactly. Hence the importance of Douglas Garth's
theory. The used copy is on die II of this stamp, showing the deeply curved crescent of the
accepted forgery whereas the unused copy is on die I and has the shallow crescent of the
generally admitted overprint on the 2 cents brown. This latter appeared in an auction of
part of the collection of the late Dr Tan of Singapore from which also came Dr Wood's
large block of Perak.

Now, while at first sight the 1873 die II with Elephant's Head wmk. would appear more
likely to provide the basis for overprinting in 1876 or later, one must remember that the
East India stamps actually used in the Straits Settlements prior to the arrival of the surcharged
issue of 1867, would necessarily be the unwatermarked issue of 1865 in which the
half anna blue was from die I. Any remainders of this last, therefore, being the nearest
equivalent to 2 cents would naturally be from this die and might possibly have been used
for overprinting by the State for sufficient reason: as an economy measure; for lack of the 2 cents brown; or merely as essay or trial.

There is hardly a scarce nineteenth century stamp that has not, at some time, been
counterfeited; some more than once. Nevertheless, that any stamp should have at least
four forged overprints and that at least three distinct and separate bogus overprints of the
same type should be struck on one other stamp seems rather excessive; particularly as it
must all have occurred within a very few years of the original stamp's appearance. Bearing
in mind the almost wholly unknown nature of this very small country, the length of time
that elapsed before knowledge of the stamp's existence spread abroad and the natural delay
before a forgery could fairly be looked for, still less a wholly bogus item, it seems far from improbable that the half anna was officially overprinted; in which case it may, equally with the 2 cents brown, have been produced from a double die.

It is noteworthy that all the specimens I have seen of the typical deeply indented crescent in the accepted forgery are from die II. This includes the copy in the Tapling Collection at the British Museum and another in the Luff Reference Collection at the Philatelic Foundation in New York. This last is annotated by Mr Luff himself: '1876 Elephant's head India
J^a. blue. . . . This is now understood to be a Benjamin & Sarpy fake.' Also in his handwriting
under the stamp: 'Cft.'

On the other hand, nearly, if not quite all the overprints on die I have the shallow type
of crescent; and this, for the reason given above, while by no means evidence of authenticity, is not without significance.

In such circumstances it is, of course, impossible to make any definite pronouncement or
even to express a strong belief. I will therefore content myself with venturing a considered opinion that the early date at which the half anna was known thus overprinted would seem to point to its having been a first edition of these provisionals, possibly as an essay prior to the use of the 2 cents brown; and may well have been the prototype and model for all three States. However, until the correctness of Mr Douglas Garth's statement can be tested, opinion on the existence of a second type of overprint must be suspended.
