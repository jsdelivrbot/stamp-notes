##Sungei Ujong



Sungei Ujong was a very small State situated on th banks of the Linggi river on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula. Now known as Seremban was originally founded as Sungei Ujong (or Sungai Ujong), named after a nearby river of the same name. While the town was renamed Seremban afterwards, the Sungai Ujong name most prominently persists as a street name for a road adjoining the southern side of town (Sungai Ujong Road, or Jalan Sungai Ujong).
The town is also referred alternately as "Fu Yong" (Chinese: 芙蓉) among the Chinese-speaking community, although the name is not recognised officially.

Sungai Ujong came into existence with the discovery of tin ore in the 1870s like most major towns in Peninsular Malaysia. The discovery of tin in a nearby area called Rasah, saw an influx of Arab, Malay and Chinese immigrants to work on the mines and trade there. Most of the local Malays were farmers.

Renamed to Seremban, the town flourished not only as a mining area but also a business centre. The Linggi River served as the sole outlet to ferry tin and supplies in and out of the town. Revenue came not only from tin trade but also from the large amount of taxes collected, much to the displeasure of the traders and the British colonialists at the neighbouring port of Malacca.

The local chieftains, namely the Dato' Kelana and the Dato' Shahbandar of Sungai Ujong were at odds with each other on the rights to collect taxes and ownership and control of the mines. The rivalry to assert influence and authority opened the door for British intervention in Negeri Sembilan. The British sided with the Dato’ Kelana upon invitation and defeated the forces of the Dato’ Bandar who was later sent into exile to Singapore. In a show of gratitude to the British for helping him win the war, the Dato' Kelana had no choice but to accept a British Resident whose job was to advise him on matters other than religion and Malay customs.

Captain Murray was appointed the first resident and later set-up his residence at Channer Road, now renamed Jalan Dato' Siamang Gagap. Soon after, the people living around Rasah moved to Channer Road for the sake of security and its orderly administration.

On April 21st, 1874, it entered into a Bond the conditions of which were \textit{inter alia} the good government of the territory; the free passage of the river and that taxes put on navigation of teh river are to be "with the sanction and approval of the Government of the Straits Settlements."

In September 1874,  a small  force of European troops and native police entered Sungei Ujong and captured a fort. Captain Tatham, R.A. was let in charge with a guard to "advise" the Dato Klana of Sungei Ujong. In December of the same year a force of Gurghas and light artillery had to be despatched from Penang. These operations were successful and by 1876 a general settlement was reached.

The first mention of the postage stamp in the philatelic press was in the \textit{Philatelic Record} of March, 1880 (Vol II, p.16), when a letter from teh European Secretary to the Maharajah of Johore was quoted as stating that Johore, Perak and some other Malay native States had used for a short period the 2 cents surcharged with a Star and Crescent. The magazine followed up the story in their February 1881 edition (Vol. III, p.6), stating that:

\begin{quotation}
In March 1880, we referred to a stamp of which we have heard, but never seen at that time; viz., the 2 cents Straits Settlements, surcharged with a Star and Crescent, for use in the states of the neighbouring potentates. This stamp, of the surcharge on which we annex an engaving, appears to have been obsolete for some time. It was sent to us by one of the BRitish official as a curiosity; but our correspondent, with the charming \textit{insouciance} so characteristic of the unphilatlic; did not deign to say whether it was used in Johore, Perak, Elswhere, or in all three places. Can the latter "S.U." have anything to do with Sunda? The surcharge is in black.
\end{quotation}

The mystery was solved in the issue for September 1881, page 147, when it was stated on good authority that the surcharge stood for---Sungei Ujong.

The overprint has teh letters "S.U." in large thick capitals, surmounted by a Crescent and Star, the whole being enclosed in a broad lined oval measuring 18x15.25mm. It was applied by mens of a handstamp to one stamp at a time. It is found occassionally on stamps with the wing margin. It is unclear how the stamps were sold or cancelled, but copies of the stamp with manuscript cancellations exist (see Figure~\ref{SUcancelled}), as well as with the Malacca B/172 obliterator. The latter appeared in a Spinks auction 8013 and described  Fine Stamps & Covers of South East Asia
