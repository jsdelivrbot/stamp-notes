\chapter{Lithuania}  

Lithuania. The first primitive stamps were issued in 1918. The Lithuanian SSR was formed in 1940, and in 1941 German stamps overprinted LIETUVA were used. 

From 1944 stamps of the USSR were used, and the first stamps of the independent republic were issued in 1990. Lithuania has used three currencies since 1990, with interesting results, worthless kopeck stamps being twice revalued. Declared in March 1990 that 1918 constitution was still valid; independence was conceded by USSR in September 1991
