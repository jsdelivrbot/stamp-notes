\chapter{Federation of Nigeria}
The Federation of Nigeria was a predecessor to modern-day Nigeria. It existed between 1 October 1960 and 1 October 1963.

When British rule ended in 1960, the Nigerian Federation was given independence under the Nigeria Independence Act.[2] The Federal Republic of Nigeria came into existence on 1 October 1963.[3] During the intervening period, the British monarch remained head of state of Nigeria, while the day-to-day functions of the head of state were performed by a governor-general. Elizabeth II was the monarch, and two people held the office of governor-general:

Sir James Wilson Robertson October 1960 - 16 November 1960

Nnamdi Azikiwe November 16, 1960 â€“ October 1, 1963

Abubakar Tafawa Balewa held office as prime minister (and head of government) of the
Federation of Nigeria during this period.

Following the abolition of the monarchy, former Governor-General Nnamdi Azikiwe became President of the new Federal Republic of Nigeria.
