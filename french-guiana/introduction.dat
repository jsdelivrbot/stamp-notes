###Introduction

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Guinea.

The Republic of Guinea  is a country in West Africa formerly known as French Guinea. Conakry is the capital, the seat of the national government, and the largest city. Guinea forms a crescent by curving from its western border on the Atlantic Ocean toward the east and the south. Its northern border is shared with Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Mali, the southern one with Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Côte d'Ivoire. The Niger River arises in Guinea and runs eastward.

###First stamps

The first stamps of independent Guinea were issued on 5 January 1959. Before that, 
Guinea used general French and French Colonies stamps, the stamps of Senegal and 
stamps of French West Africa.

Of the 212 descriptions in Scott, 130 are valued at <$1-$1+, or 61%. So it should not be difficult to have a representative collection of French Guinea for not much outlay. The classic series have produced some interesting varieties and we detail as many as possible in the pages that follow.

Federation



The French colonial territories federated into French West Africa (AEF) in 1895 issued 
their own postage stamps until 1943. 
In many cases the stamps were inscribed with the name of the federation as well as 
the colony's own name. These included Mauritania, Senegal, French Sudan (now Mali), 
French Guinea (now Guinea), Côte d'Ivoire, Niger, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) 
and Dahomey (now Benin). In 1943 and 1944, stamps of Senegal and 
Mauritania were overprinted with new values and valid throughout French West Africa. 
The first issues printed specifically for the federation were the Eboue 
common design type and a definitive series depicting colonial soldiers, both in 1945.

A series of 1947 featured 19 scenes and people of the various colonies, then during the 1950s there were about 30 various commemoratives. The last issue inscribed "Afrique occidentale française" and "RF" was the Human Rights issue of December 1958. It was followed by a Stamp Day issue on March 21, 1959, which omitted the federation's name and was inscribed "CF" along with "Dakar-Abidjan".
