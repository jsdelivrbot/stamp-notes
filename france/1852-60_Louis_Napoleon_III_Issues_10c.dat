\chapter{The Presidency Issue of 1852}

Maury's most enlightening book records the following incident.
Prince Louis Napoleon with ambitions for power, taking advantage of the political unrest
in France, took control by a coup d'etat on the night of 2nd December, 1851. He dissolved
the National Assembly, and in the plebiscite which he organised, was elected President for a term of ten years.

On 3rd January, 1852, Napoleon had a law passed for his head to replace that of Ceres
on the stamps and coins of France. Barre, who was instructed to design the new head,
decided to keep the original frame of the Ceres issue, just changing the head. Only two
stamps were issued - the 10 and 25 centimes, the values most plentifully used internally.

Within a year they were replaced by a completely new set. Barre incorporated a little personal touch in the design with a B (his initial) beneath the bust of Napoleon.

\section{Printing}
Maury in his book indicates these values were issued on 12th August, 1852. The stamps
were produced by the galvano plastic (electro-chemical) method, and to safeguard the
edges of the plate, Barre introduced metal frames round each pane of 150 stamps, thus
preventing wear to the edges of the pane. These frame lines were 8 mm. from the edge of the
panes, and were printed in the colour of respective stamps. 'Timbres avec lignes d'encadrement'
as the French describe stamps which are found with this adjoining line, command
a large premium.
