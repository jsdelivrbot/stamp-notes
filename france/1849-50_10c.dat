## French Stamps and Postal History
The 10 centimes \tete occurs in bistre, bistre-brun, and bistre-verdatre (where appropriate,
colors are described in italicized French for consistency with standard references), and is somewhat
less scarce due to the large number of 10 centimes stamps printed and the high number of \tete
cliches relative to normal cliches. Of two plates used, one had three \tete cliches at positions 27,
58, and 145, and the other was error-free, so 1\% of the cliches were erroneous. From September 1850
to September 1852, there were 17.1 million stamps of this value printed, so it can be estimated that
170 thousand \tete pairs were issued. Used pairs of this value can also be readily found, since
the 20 centimes stamp was discontinued as of July 1, 1850, and it is not uncommon to see a 10
centimes pair used to make up a 20 centimes rate.
