## French Stamps and Postal History

####1849-50 25c
The blue 25 centimes stamp was issued on July 1, 1850, to reflect an increased domestic letter rate, and remained in use until September 1852. While three plates were prepared, only two plates were used to print 45.2 million stamps. One \tete occurred at position 131 of the second plate.

The second plate was not placed in use until 4.3 million stamps had already been printed using the first
plate, so only about 136 thousand \tete pairs were printed. Since pairs of this stamp were
principally used to pay the domestic double-weight letter rate, many used \tete pairs have
survived. However, only two unused examples are known, one of which is illustrated as Figure 4 and was formerly in the Ferrary collection. Since position 131 is on the left margin of the sheet, all horizontal \tete pairs of this value must be "face-to-face", and any "back-to-back" pairs are forgeries. Figure 5 illustrates a used full-margined vertical \tete pair showing its placement near the lower left-hand corner of the plate
