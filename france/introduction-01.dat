\section{Napoleon III}
A year later, he was crowned Emperor Napoleon III. For helping in a war against
Austria in 1859, he gained from Sardinia Savoy (Savoie) and Nizza (Nice) in 1860,
but intervention in the civil war in Mexico from 1862 to 1867 ended in defeat. The
Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 led to the occupation of large parts of French territory
by the German Armies headed by Prussia and to the defeat of the French armies.

After the siege and capitulation of Paris, it came to an armistice which resulted in
the loss of the provinces of Alsace (Elsass) and Lorraine (Lothringen). Napoleon III,
who had been captured, was deposed, and the Third French RepUblic was created. The
seat of the government was transferred during the siege of Paris to Bordeaux and
had to be transferred again outside of Paris, to Versailles, after the hostilities ended,
because a kind of communist regime, the Commune of Paris, had been established
there in March 1871, which lasted for two months. Only then the republican government
returned to Paris and the National Assembly elected the chief of the provisional
government, Adolphe Thiel's, as president. In a rather short period of years
the damage, caused by war and revolution, was repaired. Thiel's resigned in 1873 and
was succeeded by Marshal MacMahon, whose residency lasted until 1879.


During the 16th and 17th centuries, France had become one of the great colonial powers,
with valuable possessions, especially in the East and West Indies, as well as on the
North American continent. But in the 18th and the early 19th century most of these
colonies were lost, mostly to the British, among them Canada, which was ceded in
1713 and 1763. The island of San Domingo, which had become a French colony in 1677,
acquired independence in 1801 and the Republic of [Haiti](../haiti/introduction) was established there.

Louisiana, the last colony on the North American continent, was sold to the United
States in 1803. During the classic stamp period, France had only a number of rather
small colonies of mediocre importance and only in later decades, by great acquisitions
on the African continent, France again became one of the great colonial powers.

\section{Postal History}

The postal history of France starts in pre-Roman times, but until the Middle Ages,
the mail service was kept for royal, governmental
and ecclesiastical matters only. The
general public had to send their letters by favour of travellers or had to bargain for
the fee with the postholders. The first
attempts to organize private mail services
were made by universities, religious orders
as well ,as large cities, by the latter mainly
for the needs of the merchants. But there
was no general organization and little
coordination. 

Only in 1464, a decree by King
Louis XI laid the foundation for an organized
governmental mail service, to serve the
general pUblic. Fixed mail routes' and
schedules were established gradually throughout
the country and postal stations were
built to sustain them. By a treaty with the
General Postmaster Francis of Taxis in 1504,
mail routes through France for the Taxis
mail service were created and in this way
postal connections with foreign countries
were established. There were still no general
letter rates, the fees to be paid having to be
agreed npon with the individual postmasters.
Only in 1576 was a uniform rate schedule
for letters established by decree and the
office of Controleur General des Postes
creater1 to supervise all mail matters. The
government mail service still had no monopoly
and the mail services of the cities,
universities, etc. provided a competition
which led to continuous conflicts. This problem
was partly solved in 1610 when the
cities were forced to abolish their mail
services. Later in the 17th century, all other
private mail services were abolished and in
1672 the government became the sole operator
of the postal service in the country. But
the government started to lease operation
of the mail service to private contractors,
who paid the king increasing amounts for
the privilege of operating the mails. This
privilege now became a highly valued possession,
which passed from one hand to
another for large sums of money. In turn,
the contractors charged the postmasters big
sums for the privilege of operating the
postal stations as well as the mail routes,
forcing the postmasters to charge high letter
and other rates to the public, to make ends
meet. In this way, the postal service became
one of the means of squeezing large
sums out of the public, especially the merchants,
who needed the mail service for
their business, and it was considered another
form of the heavy taxation by the king
customary at that time. At the same time,
the government also leased the privilege to
establish 100al mail services in the large cities and a number of "Petites Postes",
which provided local mail service only, were
created, the first one in Paris in 1653. The
first postal treaties with foreign governments
were concluded, when in 1664, the
government took over the foreign mail
service. But this was of short duration anll
in 1694, the foreign mail service together
with the domestic one was leased for an
again increased amount to a contractor. 

The
postal privilege eventually fell into the hands
of a clique of a few noble families who, to
make up for the steadily mounting yearly
tribute they had to pay to the king, increasell
the postal rates so high that practically only
the rich people and, for necessity, the businessmen,
could make use of the mails. Nevertheless,
the mail service had developed
steadily and in 1735 there were almost 1000
post offices in the country. 


The mail service to foreign countries also developed and in
1778 for the first time a speeial ship mail service to the colonies was inaugurated,
which extended in 1786 to North America.

In 1780, the first step to re-establish government operated mail service was made, by
taking over all "Petites Postes" in the cities, which in 1786 were consolidated with the
other postal service, when establishment of local mail delivery was considered. One of
the first acts after the revolution of 1789 was to end the leasing of the postal service
and to put its operation again into the hands of the government. 

A Direction Generale des Postes was established in 1789, which
effected a complete reorganization of the postal service and the establishment of
uniform postal rates. For the following years, a large part of the efforts had to be concentrated on the organization of the mail service in the occupied countries, as well
as to and from the French armies, scattered all over Enrope and North Africa. 

In this way, quite a reorganization of the European mail service in general took place, with routes running throughout the whole continent, among them, from 1812, a direct
overland mail route from Paris to Constantinople, where a French post office was
opened in 1813. After the end of the Napoleonic period, the domestic mail service
was improved. Rural mail service was introduced in 1830 and, a few years later, the
first raill'oads and steam boats were used for tmnsporting the mails. The first rather
primitive travelling post offices were estab-lished in 1844 to he made a ennanent
iustitntion on Jan. 1, 1845. 

\section{Uniform Letter Rate and the First Stamps}
A uniform letter rate for the whhole country (including Algeria) was debated for a number of years, fore it was accepted, together with the introduction of the first postage stamps, on Jan. 1, 1849. The postal selTice was now conducted by a Direction de L'Administration
Generale des Postes. For the various wars in which the country was involved between
1815 and 1870, rather elaborate fieldpost organizations ,verI' in operation.

During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, the postal service, went through its most
trying period since the issuance of postage stamps. Paris, the seat of the postal administration, was threatened by encirclement and then the government moved to Bordeaux, the postal administration, which had been consolidated with the telegraph administration,
followed suit. 

Large parts of the country were occupied by the enemy and, after the siege of Paris became complete in September 1870, the postal administration was cut off from its supply of postage stamps and its Paris printing plant. Shortage of stamps soon made itself felt and supplies were shifted from one part of the country to another and from one post office to another.

As there was no suitable government printing
plant outside of Paris which could print
typographed stamps, the original plan to
get the printing plates or matrices from
Paris by balloon was abandoned. As the
Bordeaux Mint had adequate facilities for
manufacturing lithographed stamps, an
emergency issue, lithographed and imperforate,
"was hurriedly" produced there and the
first v,alue issued as early as Nov. 13, 1870.

These emergency" stamps, together with the
available stock of previous issues, served
the post offices in the unoccupied parts of
the country outside Paris. Their further manufacture
was abandoned in :March 1871, when
the Paris Mint again was able to supply
stamps to the whole country. During the
siege, Paris had the facilities of the Paris
~Hnt at its disposal and therefore did not
suffer any shortages of stamps; even the
plates of 10c, 20c .and 40c in the old Ceres
design of 1849 were reactivate(l in October
1870 and were useel for the so-called Paris
Siege issue, which until March 1871 was
used only in Paris. 

\section{Balon Monte}
During the siege, Paris tried first to send mail runners through the
German lines, but when this failed-only few such mail runners re,ached friendly
territory and still fewer returned safely to
the city, a regular service by balloons was
established in September 1870, which functioned
until January 1871. 

This was the
first goverment-organized air mail service
in the world. A similar one, but of much less
importance, was organized in the beleaguered
fortl'ess of Metz until it surrendered to the
el",my, from August to October 1870. The
Paris balloon service carried about 2,500,000
pieces of mail, on 66 flights. 

Mail from outside Paris to the city was successfully delivered
by carrier pigeons. A futile attempt to send mail down the Seine to Paris in
floating containers was also made. Soon after the siege was lifted, the rebellion of
the Paris Commune in March 1871 made the
constitntional government ,again move from
Paris, this time to Versailles, and the postal
and telegraph administration was also established
there. The Paris Commune had
established its own postal administration,
which was restricted to Paris, but had not
only taken possession of the Paris Mint, but
also of all printing material and the stocks
of stamps. While Paris was well supplied
with stamps-the existing stocks and new
printings from the old plates, in the Ceres
and Xapoleon designs - there was again
shortage of stamps outside of Paris. The
existi" g stocks were shifted around, but
this was not sufficient and the postal administration
was just considering reactivation
of the emergency printing of stamps in
Bordeaux, when the rebellion was suppressed
in May 1871 and the regular Paris printing
facilities again became available. But it
took until 1872 for the supply of stamps to
became regular again and until 1877 for the
last stamps with the Napoleon head to be
replaced by stamps in a mOl'e republican
design.

After return of the postal and telegraph administration to Paris in May 1871, the great task of complete reorganization of the service was started, which took several years, almost to the end of the classic stamp period.


In 1873, there were about 11,500 miles of
railroads. There was, in contrast to many
other countries, no postal parcel post in
France during the classic stamp period,
postal parcels being introduced there only
in 1881. France harl a great number of
postal treaties with foreign countries and
in 1875 became a founding member of the Universal Postal Union. Due to difficulties
in the legislature, the universal postal treaty
became effective in France on Jan. 1, 1876,
six months later than in the other founding
countries.


During the classic stamp period, the volume of mail showed a sharp increase for
which principally the cheap uniform letter rates, introduced simultaneously with the
postage stamps, were responsible. The number of domestic letters was 158 million, ineluding 26.1, million city letters, in 1849, and rose to 185j1, million in 1853, 290 million in 1863 and 365 million in 1869, went back to 349 million in 1872 and 354 million
in 1873, after the war of 1870-71 and the loss of Alsace and Lorraine, to start to rise
again slowly in the following years. An equally high amount of other mail was
carried, for example 379 million newspapers in 1869.

When postage stamps were introduced on Jan. 1, 1849, France had a highly developed
postal system. There were about 3500 post offices in operation and their number increased
rather rapidly. The acquisition of Savoy and Nizza in 1860 added 113 llost
offices ,am] at the end of 1862 they numbered in France proper around 4500. The
loss of Alsace and Lorraine in 1871 involved
also the loss of 170 post offices which came
under German sovereignty. At the end of
the classic period, at the beginning of 1876,
there were in France over 6250 post offices.
According to their importance, the post
offices were divided into several categories,
"Bureaux de Direction", from 1864 named
"Bureaux de R,ecette", being the highest
grade of offices, while "Bureaux de Distribution"
had somewhat restricted service
only. "Facteurs-Boitiers", which worked
mainly in the rural parts, were a kind of
letter collecting agency, with rather strongly
reduced serviee. In the capital, Paris, there
were about 25 post offices in 1849 ann almost
40 in 1876, ,not counting the post offices
in the suburbs whieh were incorporatecl into
the capital in 1860. The Paris main post
offic,e had the name "Bureaux Central";
the other offices were either "Bureaux Principal"
or, with reduced service, "Bm'eaux
Supplementaires".

In Algeria, which was considered part of France, there were around 25 post offices in 1849 and 30 in 1853; then a fast development set in and the number of post offices increased to 80 in 1863 and 140 in 1876. 

\section{Travelling Post Offices}
the first reguLar travelling post offices on railroad trains were created in France on Jan 1, 1845. 

They were active on 5 routes in 1855, on over 50 routes in 1863 and more than 80 routes at the end of the classic period in 1876. No actual travelling post offices existed on ships. 

While facilities for the handling of mail by the personnel of the ships existed long before stamps were introducen, contractual agreements
for the aeceptance of mail on board of ships seem to have existed only since
1853.

France had a number of post officcs on
foreign territory, but all of the early ones
were closed before the end of the 18th
eentury and, therefore, are of lesser interest.
In 1860, when Savoy and Nizza had come
to France, it inherited also the postal service
in the principality of Monaco, which from
then on was conducted by the French postal
administration as part of its own service.

Only one post office, in the capital Monaco,
existed during the classic stamp period. In
the little republic of Andorra in the Pyrenees,
the postal service was conducted by the two
protectors, Fr,ance and Spain, but there is
no proof that a regular French postal service
existed in Andorra during the elassic stamp
perion, although there are strong indications
that postal facilities were provined by the
French postal service. On Swiss territory,
in Basel, from 1846 to 1865, France had a
post offiee at the railroad station, mainly
to faeilitate the transit of mail. A number
of post offices existed during the classic
stamp perion in various towns of the
Turkish Ernpire and its tributary territories.
In 1813, such offices had been established
a t Constantinople, Salonica, Smyrna and
Bosna-Serail. Several new offices were opened
around 1830, and others had been closed_
In 1849, French post offices functioned in
Constantinople, Beyrouth, Dardanelles and
Smyrna as well as Alexandria (Egypt). Between
1852 and 1863, 18' more post offices on
Turkish territory were opened and one closed.
During the same period, one more post
office in Egypt (Suez), two in MoldaviaWa,
lachia (Galatz, Ibraila), one in Tunisia
(,runis) ann one in Morocco (Tangier)
started to operate, as well as one in China
(Shanghai). After 1863, nine additional
post offices, of which five were in the
Turkish Empire, two in Egypt, one in Tunisia
and one in Japan (Yokohama), were opened and six closed, of which three' wele
in the Turkish Empire, one in Egypt and
two in Moltana-Walachia (now Romania).
At the end of the classic stamp period, in
1876, there existed 31 French post offices
on foreign soil, namely 23 in the Turkish
Empire, three in Egypt, two in Tunisia and
one e.ach in 11orocco, China and Japan.
Aside from regular post offices on foreign
soil, additional postal facilities were operated
at some French consulates. In some cases,
they acted as feeders to the regular French
post offices, especially on Turkish territory, and St. Denis, which were in the hands of
the governmental postal service, were used
as exchange points. Mail was taken over and
delivered in Paris either directly from or
to private senders, or to the Commune postal
service. As the rebellion lasted for not much
more than two months, these private mail
Eervices were of very short duration and
they vanished after the suppression of the
Commune.
France used as c'ulTency the franc, which
was divided into 100 centimes. It became the
main currency of the Latin Currency Union
to which a large nnmber of the European
countries belonged. In the postal service,
another unit of currency, the decime, equivalent
to 10 centimes, was also used, especially
for rate or postage due markings. A rate
figure "2" on an old letter therefore usually
means 2 decimes or 20 centimes, and a
postage due marking "1" should be considered
as 1 decime or 10 centimes.-Weights and
distances were measured in the metric system,
which was created during the French Revolution.
']'he kilogram was divided into 1000
gr,ams (1 ounce equivalent to 28% grams).
The kilometer was equivalent to about fiveeights
of a mile.
During the French Revolution, a "republican
calendar" was introduced by a law of
Nov. 24, 1793 and made retmactive to the
day of the proclamation of the Republic
(Sept. 22, 1192). The year consisted of 12
months of 30 days each, with five or-in
leap years-six complimentary days at the
end of the year. New flowery names were
introduced for the months and the years
received Roman numbers, starting with I,
which year ran from Sept. 22, 1792 to Sept.
21, 1793, and so forth, until during the year
XIV, by a law of Sept. 5, 1805, the "republican
calendar" was abolished and from Jan.
1, 1806, the Gregorian calendar reintroduced.
'To determine how long the classic stamp
period in France lasted is rather difficult.
The first real stamp collectors and dealers
were active in Fmnce in the early Sixties
and soon starter! to influence even the stamp
manufacture, as is proven by the imperforate
stamps of the 1862 and 1863 issnes, made
in 1869 for the stamp collector Baron
Arthur de Rothschild. Therefore, the real
classic stamp period ended in France with
the issuance of the first perforated issue
in 1862. But as philatelic influence was
still in its infancy and restriction of our ino!lograph to the issues hefore 1863 would
do injustice to 99% of the classic material
of the issues until 1876, we have decided
to consider as classic issues all postage
stamps issued before 1876 - therefore all
stamps in the Ceres design and with the
head of ~apoleon III-and all postage due
stamps in the square design, in usc until
1882. All newspaper and telegraph stamps
can in any case be considered classic stamps
because their use ceased in 1870 and 1871
1'espectively.
France was the sixth country-the third
in Europe-to issue adhesive stamps. Postage
Sta,mps were introduced on Jan. 1, 1849,
Postage Due Stamps on Jan. 1, 1859. France
was the first country to issue this latter
eategory of stamps. The offieial term
"Chiffre-Taxe" for these stamps did not
make much sense, but it became so traditional
that only in 1946 the eorrect term
"Timbre-'l'axe" was adopted for use on the
postage due stamps. Combined Newspaper
and Newspaper Tax Stamps were issued on
Jan. 1, 1869, Telegraph Stamps on Jan. 1,
1868. K a postal stationery with imprinted
stamps was issued during the elassic stamp
period. Postal Cards, officially printed and
soleI at the post offices from Jan. 1, 1873,
had regular postage stamps p.asted on. Pestal
cards had been used temporarily previously,
during the siege of Paris, from September
1870 to January 1871, but they w'ere issuel]
without stamps pasted on.
The Combined Newspaper and Newspaper
Ta.x Stamps are a peculiar kind of stamps
am] France was the only country to usc
them. Basically they were fiscal stamps which
were intended to collect the tax levied upon
nowspapers, 5c for newspapers published in
the Mpartements Seine (Paris) and Seine
& Oise (Paris suburbs), 2c in the other
departements. Both values wore prepared in
three colors, lilac, blue and 1'ose. '\Vllile the
lilac stamps were to be sold for the value
printed on them (2c, 5c), the blue stamps
were to be sold with a surtax of 2c (therefore
for 4c and 7c), the rose stamps with a
surtax of 4c (therefore for 7c and 9c). 'l'he
surtax of 2c and 4c was the postal fee for
newspapers, 2c for delivery within the d(~partement
where the newspaper was ]JUblished
and 4c for delivery within all France induding
Algeria. Therefore, ,he lilac stamps
were purely newspaper tax stamps. In
variance to the use of newspaper tax stamps in other C~JUntJ'ies (Austria, Modena, Parma,
etc.), they were not employed by the post
offices and generally can be found only On
newspapers which were not mailed, therefore
have no philatelic standing at all and we do
not have to deal with them. But as the blue
and rose stamps paid not only the newspaper
tax but also thc postal fees, they are I)hilatelie.
ally on a much highcr level than
newspaper tax stamps; they are combined
newspaper and newspaper tax stamps, which
arc of the same philatelic standing as the
plain newspaper stamps of other countries.
Only the values of 2c (+2c) and 2c (+4c)
were ever issued, while the 5c (+2c) and the
5c (+4c) were prepared, but never put into
usc. After Sept. 6, 1870, when the newspaper
tax was abolished, the stamps paid for postal
fees only and therefore were Tegular newspapel'
stamps. We will call them simply
newspaper stamps in our discussions.
The introduction of the different kinds of
stamps on the dates given was restricted to
Franee proper (including the island of
Corsic.a) as well as to Algeria, which was not
considered a colony but lJaTt of France. The
first extension of the territory where postage
~tamps were used occured late in 1851, when
stocks of stamps were sent to five colonies,
Freneh Guiana, Freneh India, Guadeloupe,
Martinique and Reunion. At the offiees
abroad, as far as the offiees in the TUTkish
Bmpire and its tributary states are eoneerned,
postage stamps were inhodueed
generally in the seeand half of 1857, but in
some eases, stamps must have been sent
there several yean earlier, as a numbeT of
eovers with stamps are known from Constantinople
as early as May, 1854. Postage due
stamps were put into use there shortly after
their introduetion, but are known from Constantinople
only. Their use seems to have
eeased after 1871 as only the 100, (lithographcd
-and typographed) and the 150, (typographed)
are known used there. ·When Savoy
and Xizza (mme to Franee, Freneh postage
stamps amI postage due stamps wel'e intro(
lneed there On July 1, 1860, replaeing the
stamps of Sardinia, eurrent there until then.
The same was the case in }'Ionaeo, whieh was
henoeforth treated in respeet to postal affairs
exaetly as if it had been a part of
Franee propcr. The same must have been
the ease with Andorra, if a Freneh postal
servic functioned there during the classic
stamp period, which is not proven. The post office at Basel in Switzerland ~eems 10
ha\'e worked as transit office only and Ill'
stamps were in use there.
In the French Colonies, the use of French
stamps ,..-as a temporary one. After two
years, late in 1853, it was discontinue'l and
the colonies reYerted to payment of postage
in cash. These conditions remained in force
until the middle of 1859, when a general
issue for the French Colonies, in a special
design, ,..-as introduced in all colonies. This
changerl again in December 1871, when
stamps of the motherIand were introduced
in the colonies, the only distinction being
that they were left imperforate, while the
stamps issued in France proper (and Algeria)
were perforated, a policy which was
continued until five years after the end of
the classic stamp period. We will not deal
with these stamps used in the colonies only.
In Cochinchina, during the pacification of
the country, from 1860, regular French
stamps were used, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80c of
1853; only from .June 1, 1863, the general
issue for the French Colonies was introduce,l
there also. This is the only proven case of
issuance and usc of regular French stamps
in the colonies after 1859. It has been
claimed that during the emergency of 1870n,
due to lack of stocks of the special
colonial issue, regular French stamps were
sent to some colonies and used there especially
the 5fr of 1863 and several values
of the Bordeaux issue of 1870-but this has
not been proven.
France had rather simple postal rates.
\Vhen postage stamps were issued on .Jan. 1,
1849, simultaneously a new rate schedule
was introduced, 'Yith a uniform letter rate
for France including Algeria, without re,
spect to the distance. Letters paid 20c up
to 70 grams, 40c from 70 to 15 grams.
Ifr from 15 to 100 grams and Ifr for each
,additional 100 grams or part thereof. For
local mail, thm'e were different rates for
the capital, Paris, and for other cities, a
single letter (up to 70 grams) was charged
in Paris 15c and in other places 10c. Registered
letters paid double rates. For newspapers
and printed matter rather complicated
rates were in force, based on size and
number of pages. On .July 1, 1850, some
changes took pIace, the rate for letters to
70 grams was increased to 25c, from 70
to 15 grams to 50c; a uniform registration
where mail from inland town was in this
way brought to the French post offices in
the sea ports. Examples of this were the
French consulates at Aleppo and Jerusalem,
which accepted mail and forwarded it by
,my of the French post offices at Alexandretta
and Jaffa respectively. In other cases,
the consulates acted as feeders for the
mail-carrying French shipping lines, especially
in South America, where the consulates
functioned as postal agencies and delivered
the mail entrusted to them directly to the
French ships which carried it to Europe.
This was the case especially in Argentina
and Venezuela, where this mail service assumed
large proportions, but also, to a
smaller extent, in other countries in South
America and in the Carribean.
The postal service in France during the
classic stamp period was so efficient that
it left practically no room for private mail
services. Only during the emergency of the
Commune of Paris in 1871, when the capital
was in the hands of rebels, private initiative
was able to interwne. The postal administration
of the constitutional government
did not recognize the postal administration
of the Commune. ']'herefore, the former did
not accept mail from the Commune postal
service and did not deliver any mail destined
for Paris to the latter. Paris, after the
months of the siege, in this way again was
separated from the other parts of the country
and the mail service to and from the outside
world was completely interrupted. With the
permission of the Commune postal administration
and tolerated by the governmental
postal administration, a number of private
agencies were cre,ated ill Paris which against
a fee acted as intermediaries for mail from
Paris to other parts of France 01' foreign
countries, and vice-versa. Several post offices
in the vicinity of Paris, especially Vincennes
fee of 25c was introdnceel at the same time.
Only for soldier's letters, the aIel letter rates
remained in force. Circulars aurl simila r
printed matter now paid a straight rate of
fico From Aug. 1, 1850, when a newspaper
tax was introduced, taxed newspapcrs wcre
tr,ansported and delivereel free within France
I.nd Algeria. This was abolisheel in 1852
and newspapers then had to pay postage in
adrlition to the newspaper tax. The reduced
rates were 2c for delivery within the same
dcpartement and 4c to other parts of France
and Algeria. On .July 1, 1853, the Paris
local letter rate was reduced to 10e. A year
later, on .July 1, 1854, a reduction of the
domestic letter rates took place. Letters
within France and Algeria now paid 20c up
to 70 grams, 40c from 70 to 15 grams,
80c from 15 to 100 grams and 80c for each
additional 100 grams or part thereof. For
unpaid letters, a surcharge of 50 % in
addition to these rates was now collected
from the addressee. The registration fee also
was reduced, to 20c. On Aug. 1, 1856, the
rates for printed matter anel newspapers were
simplified and also based upon weight only.
Printed matter now paid lc for each 5
grams, 10c for 50 to 100 grams, etc., news,
papers paid 2c up to 20 grams and lc for
each additional 10 grams within the same
dcpartement, twice these fees to other parts
of the country and to Algeria. A new reduction
of the letter rates took place on
.July 1, 1860, by increasing the weight limits
for other than local letters. The lowest letter
rate was now to 10 grams, the second category
from 10 to 20 grams. On .Jan. 1, 1863,
another reduction of the local rates, including
Paris, took place. Local letters up to 10
grams now paid 10c, from 10 to 20 grams
20c, from 20 to 100 grams 40c and for
each additional 100 grams 40c. For unpaid
letters, .a 50% surcharge as for other domestic
letters was now COllected. 

In May,
1863, a special Late Fee was introduced for
letters which were posted after the closing
of the mails. Up to a quarter of an hour
delay, the fee was 20c, from a quarter to
half an hour 40c and thereafter, until the
actual departure of the mail, 60c. The last
category was collected only outside Paris.

The war of 1870-71 led to an increase in to 50 grams 70c, from 50 to 100 grams 1£1'
20c, and for each' additional 50 grams 50c.
The minimum fee for printed matter was
increased from 1c to 2c. The registration
fee was more than doubled and now 50c.
Local letters paid up to 10 grams 15c
(unpaid 25c), from 10 to 20 grams 25c
(unpaid 40c), from 20 to 50 gr,ams 40c
(unpaid 60c), from 50 to 100 grams 65c
(unpaid 1£1') and for each additional 50
grams 25c (unpaid 40c). Postal Cards, when
they were introduced on Jan. 1, 1873, paid
15c within Fr,ance and Algeria and 10c in
the local mail service. On Jan. 1, 1876, the
limits of weight were increased; letters now
paid 2.'5c up to 15 grams, 40c from 15 to
30 grams, 70c from 30 to 50 grams and
70c for each additional 50 grams. A final
st,abilization of the rates took place on June
1, 1878, when the reduced rates for local
mail were abolished and a uniform domestic
letter rate of 15c for letters up to 15 grams
and of 10c for postal cards was established.
At the same time, the postage due rates
were increased to a surcharge of 100%,
making unpaid mail now pay twice as much
as paid one.
The rates for foreign mail were rather
simple compared with those of other countries
and there were few changes during the
classic stamp period. In 1875, before the
uniform U. P. U. rates came into force,
single letters to European countries paid
between 25c (to Luxembourg) and 70c (to
Norway), 50c to the United States, 80c to
Egypt and 1£1' to most overseas countries,
except the French Colonies, which had special
rates, varying from 35 to 50c. The uniform
rates of the U. P. U.-letters 30c for 15
grams (U. S. A. 40c), postal cards 15c
(U. S. A. 20c) and printed matter 5c (U.S.A.
8c) for 50 grams--came into force on Jan.
1, 1876.
Special rates were in force for the ba.lloon
mail during the siege of Paris, from September
1870 to January 1871. For mail from
Paris, domestic and foreign rates were the
same as for regular single letters but the
maximum weight was reduced to 4 grams
and the same rates were valid for letters,
printed matter and postal cards. Only for
the latter, the rate within France an(l
Algeria was reduced to 10c. No registered
mail Or mail of higher weight was accepted
for transportation by the balloons.

The newspaper tax, which was introduced
on Aug. 1, 1850, was 5c in the departements
of Seine and Seine & Oise, including Paris,
and 2c in other departements. The former
tax inelUlle(l free transportation in all of
France and in Algeria, the latter only in
the departement where the newspaper was
published. Newspapers which were delivered
locally paid lc tax. From 1852, the tax
,,,,as increased from 5c to 6c for Paris and
neighborhood and from 2c to 3c in the
other parts of the country; at the same
time, the free mailing privilege was abolished.
In 1868, the tax returned to the
previous rates, 5c and 2c; they were in
use when the combined newspaper and newspaper
tax stamps were introduced and remained
in force until the newspaper tax
was abolished on Sept. 6, 1870.
The telegraph fees were established on
March 1, 1851, when the telegraph service
was opened for private use and were subject
to several reductions. When telegraph stamps
were introduced on Jan. 1, 1868, telegrams
within the same departement cost 50c, within
France and Algeria 1£1', with a 50% surtax
for night telegrams.
The rates of the Paris private mail
services during the Commune rebellion were
strongly influenced by competition. The
earliest services charged a fee of no less
than 50c for each letter, but when new
services were established by competitors,
the fee was reduced to 25c, 15c and eventually
10c for a letter. Printed matter paid
a fee of 5c, registered letters 50c.
The rates for letters from the French
Colonies during the period of use of stamps
of the motherland, from 1851 to 1853, were
based upon a rate for single letters of
7)/, grams weight. For transportation by
French merchant ships, the fee was 25c
plus 10c, ship fee-the latter was not collected
for mail of military personnel-,by
British ships 1£1' from Reunion and 1£1'
50c from the colonies in India and in
America.

Prepayment of mail fees was not obligatory
during the first years of the use
of postage stamps. Only registered letters,
printed matter and newspapers had to be
prepaid by the sender. On July 1, 1850,
even a temporary step in opposite direction
was made, abolishing the regulation that
registered letters had to be sent prepaid.


the postal rates, which became effective on
Sept. 1, 1871. Letters up to 10 grams now
paid 25c, from 10 to 20 grams 40c, from 20 In 1849, less than 10% of all letters were
mailed prepaid and this ratio increased to
only little over 20% in 1853. Prepaymen-;-,
was made obligatory for letters within France
and Algeria-except for local letters-on
July 1, 1854, from which day on a surtax
of 50% was collected from the addressee
for unpaid or part paid letters. The same
regulations came into force for local letters
on Jan. 1, 1863. The collecting of a surtax
led to a gre-at increase of prepaid letters
and in 1863, 90%, in 1869 almost 95%
of all domestic letters were mailed prepaid.
The prepayment of the newspaper tax and
of the telegraph fees was always obligatory.
For letters to foreign countries, generally
no obligatory prepayment existed before the
U. P. U. rates came into force in France
on Jan. 1, 1876, but several postal treaties
secured preferred rates for prepaid letters.
The use of postage stamps started in
France and Algeria on Jan. 1, 1849, but for
letters outside of the local mail service only.
The fees for local letters continued to be
paid in cash until August 1, 1850, when
the necessary low values for such letters
became available. The fees for printed
matter and newspapers also continued to be
paid in cash; only from Aug. I, 1856, could
payment of the fees for printed matter be
made with postage stamps. The late fee
introduced in 1863 had to be paid in stamps.
After abolition of the special newspaper
stamps in 1870, the use of postage stamps
was also extended to the payment of fees for
newspapers. The use of stamps on mail to
foreign countries was permitted from July
1, 1850. The postage due stamps from their
introduction on Jan. 1, 1859 were first used
only for unpaid single local letters outside
Paris, from June 1, 1859, including the
rural mail service of a post office, but still
only for single local letters and only outside
of Paris. On Sept. 1, 1871, the use
of postage dues was extended to heavier
letters and other mail, but still only for
local mail outside Paris. 

The use of postage
dues for all domestic mail including local
letters in Paris started only on Oct. 1, 1882.


The newspaper stamps were introduced on
Jan. 1, 1869, and used for payment of the
postage plus newspaper tax on newspapers.
Their regular use ceased, when the newspaper
tax was abolished on Sept. 6, 1870. Although
the use of these stamps was intended for Paris as well as outside of it, they
were in fact never used in P,aris and suburbs,
where the pnblishers preferred to continue
to pay postage in cash. The telegmph stamps
were nsed for the payment of telegraph
fees from Jan. 1, 1868, until April 4, 1871,
when their use was abolished as impractical.
They were used only for telegrams mailed
by the public to the telegraph offices but
nut for those delivered there personally and
paid for in cash.
The q7tantities of sta.mps used increased
with the volume of mail on the one hand
and with the creation of a surtax for unpaid
letters on the other hand. In 1849, about
19 million stamps were used, increasing to
over 31 million in 1853. When the use of
stamps was made obligatory, the rise became
steeper, to almost 83Vz million in 1854,
almost 200 million in 1858, 414 million in
1865 and 546 million in 1869. The war of
1870-71 brought a decrease to 402 million
in 1870 and 483 million in 1871, to be followed
again by a rise to 549 million in 1872
and 543 million in 1873.
During the classic stamp period, France
issued only denominations which were necessary
for the most needed rates. "-'ben Postage
Stamps mere introduced on Jan. 1, 1849,
only three values were issued, 20e, iOe and
lfr, representing the three letter rates. The
20c and Ifr were used from the given date,
but the 40c was delivered by the printer
only in December 1849, and put into use
late in January, 1850. The rate increase
of July 1, 1850 made 25e stamps necessary,
which were in use from that day. The 20c
stamp, which had become unnecessary, was
withdrawn from the post offices on June
30, 1850. For city letters, for which payment
in cash ceased on Aug. 1, 1850, new values
of 10c and 15c were necessary, which came
into use on that day. The 15c stamp became
unnecessary after less than three years of
use, when the local rate for Paris was
reduced to 10c from July 1, 1853 and it
was withdrawn from the post offices on June
30, 1853. The rate reduction of July 1,
1854 made necessary a new value of BOc
and required the re-introduction of the 20c
value. The latter came into use on July 1,
1854, the former in October, 1854. The now
unnecessary 25c and Ifr stamps were withdrawn
from the post offices on June 30,
1854. When payment of postage in stamps for printed matter started, a 5e value was
issued on Sept. 15, 1854, which was also useful
as additional value to make up some rates
to foreign countries. For payment of postage
for newspapers, stamps of 1e, 2c and 4e
were issued, the first on March 1, 1860, the
latter two on Jan. 1, 1863. A new value of
.10e, which was mainly needed for postage
on samples, but was also useful to make up
some letter rates, was issued in April, 1867.
A high value, 5fr, was introduced in November,
1869; it was mainly needed for
postage on registered money lettm·s. The
rate increase of Sept. 1, 1871, made necessary
the re-introduction of the lSe and 2Se
values, which were in use from that day.
The 10c and 20c stamps were withclrawn
shortly afterwards, the former to avoid confusion
with the new 15c stamp which had
the same color. But when p08tal cards were
introduced on .Jan. 1, 1873, which made 10e
stamps necessary, this value was re-introduced.
At the end of the classic pOl'iod, there
were 11 denominations of postage stamps in
use, Ie, 2c, 4c, 5c, 10c, 15c, 250, 30c, 40c, 80c
and 5fr.
Of the Postage Due Stamps, first only
011e value, 10e for local letters outside Paris,
was introduced on Jan. 1, 1859. When :J
500/0 surtax was introduced for local letters
On Jan. 1, 1863, it was withdrawn and replaced
by a 15e v,alue, which was issued on
that day. The increase of the postal rates
from Sept. 1, 1871, led to the issuance on
that day of three more values, 2Se, 40e and
60e, all for local mail only, while the 15c
became unnecessary. The rate increase of
Feb. 1, 1876, made the 60e value unnecessary
and it was withdrawn, but it was re-introduced
on June 1, 1878, together with a new
30c v,alue, owing to the increase of the
postage due surcharge to 1000/.0, which also
made the values of 25c and 40c unnecessary.
At the end of the classic stamp period,
therefore only postage dues of two values,
30c and 60c, were in actual use. Of the
N ewspa,per Stamps, foul' values, 2c (+2c),
2c ( +4c), 5c ( +2c) and 5c (+4c) were prepared
to be issued on Jan. 1, 1869, the first
two for use in the departements, the last two
for nse in Paris and suburbs. Only the
2c (+2c) for delivery within the departement,
and 2c (+4c) for delivery within all
France and Algeria, were actually issued,
while the two 5c values (for use in Paris and suburbs) remained unissuecl. The Telegmph
Stamps, issued on Jan. 1, 1868, comprisecl
the four most neecled values, 2Sc,
SOc, 1fr and 2tr. Of the Postal Cards, two
kinds with affixed postage stamps, were
issued, 10c for local delivery and 15c for
delivery within France and Algeria.
Of the private mail services during the
Commune of Paris only one, the Agence
Lorin, issued adhesives for the service, while
this ,agency and another one, the Agence
Moreau, issued special envelopes. The issuance
of adhesive stamps by the Agence Lorin
was influenced by the fact, that the stamp
dealer, Arthur Maury, was a partner of that
agency and the special adhesives were abviously
his idea. Postage stamps in the denominations
of 5c (for printed matter),
10c (for letters) ,and 50c (for registered
letters) were issued early in May 1871 and
were used for outgoing letters. Postage Due
stamps of 5c (for printed matter), 20c (for
letters) and 60c (for registered letters)the
last two including the 10c local postage
to be paid by the agency for each letter
to the Commune postal administration-were
used for incoming mail, to be delivererl in
Paris. The Agence Moreau printed envelopes
of Hic (for letters) and 25c (for heavier
letters), which fees included a special return
envelope, to be used for the answering letter
and to be delivered in Paris without charge
by the agency. The Agence Lorin printed
special 10c enwlopes ,,,hich could be inserted
in letters from Paris and which
wet'e good for delivery of the answer in Paris.
Only a few stamps were withdrawn from
l1se, as stated previously, namely of the
postage stamps the 20c of 1849 on June 30,
1850, the 15c of 1850 on June 30, 1853, the
25c of 1852 and 1853 as well as the 1£1' of
1849 and 1853, on June 30, 1854, the 10c and
20c of 1863 and 1870 late in 1871, and the
80c of 1872 in May 1876. All other postage
stamps remained in use until they were used
up, except the stamps of the provisional
Bordeaux issue of 1870 which were withdrawn
when the emergency ended. The stamps of
the last dassie issue 1870-75 as well as the
5fr 1863 remained in use until replaced
by the corresponding values of the new
1876 issue which started to appeal' in May,
1876. The last values to be withdrawn were
the 5fr 1863 and the 40c 1870, which remained
in use until new 5fr and new 40c were issued on June 1, 1877, all(l in June
1878, respectively; the 5fr can still be found
used occasionally in 1878.-0f the postage
dne stamps, the 10c and 15c became useless
on Jan. 1, 1863, and Sept. 1, 1871, respectively
when new rates were introduced. The
10c is claimed to have been withdrawn on
Dec. 31, 1862, bnt the existence of used
multiples indicates that either some PORt
offices must still have had stocks when the
increased rates of Sept. 1, 1871, came into
force or else that small remainders were
re-issued in September 1871, before the new
values of 25c, 40c and 60c were available.
The 15c was not immecliately withdrawn
on Aug. 31, 1871, but owing to lack of 25c
postage due stamps, partly used as provisional
25c postage due st.amp, in which case
the additional 10c were accounted separately
by the post offices. Some post offices
changed the "15" of such stamps by manuscript
or handstamp into "25". Only at the
end of September 1871, when the 25c postage
due st.amps became generally available, the
15c stamps were definitely withdrawn. Of the
new values of 1871, the 60c was withdrawn
on Jan. 31, 1876, due to the increase in the
rates on Feb. 1, ] 876. The 25c and 40c were
withdrawn on May 31, 1878, again because
of changes in the rates. The last two values,
the 30c and the re-introduced 60c of 1878,
were not withdrawn when corresponding
values in a new design were issued on June
15, 1881 anc1 in May, 1884, respectively,
but used up. The 60c is known used as late as
1890.-The newspaper tax stamps became
useless and were withdrawn when the newspaper
tax was abolished on Sept. 6, 1870.The
telegraph stamps had the same fate,
when the telegraph administration was consolidated
with the postal administration and
payment of telegraph fees by way of special
stamps was aholi shed soon afterwards, on
April 4, 1871.

France belonged to those countries which did not demonetize any stamps during the
classic stamp period. Only on Jan. 14, 1914, the postage stamps issued before 1876 lost
their validity for payment of postage. No demonetization of the postage due stamps
seems to have been regarded necessary, because they could not be used by the public
,anyway. During the war of 1870-71, the validity of French stamps ceased in the
provinces occupied by the Germans. Special occupation stamps-sec Alsace-Lorrainewere
introduced early in September, 1870
-earliest date known is Sept. 6-when the
post offices were again opened, but no usc
of French stamps was permitted. Except
for tIle provinces of Alsace and Lorraine,
which remained under German rule, the occupation
stamps were withdrawn in the
other occupied French provinces on March
24, ] 871, and French stamps re-introduced.
The classic period of French postage
stamps is dominated by one design, the
Ceres head, which remained in use from
] 849 to 1876, interrupted by the change of
design from 1852 to 1870, during the rule
of Napoleon III. The upright rectangular
design, which shows the Ceres head in a
circle of pearls, with a simple meander-type
frame at left and right, inscriptions at top
and bottom, became RO popular, that it was
copied or adapted by several other countries
for use on their own stamps and has influenced
many more classic stamp designs.
The inscriptions read "REPUB. FRANC."
at top and "POSTES" at bottom, the latter
flanked on both sides by the value indication.
When Louis Napoleon Bonaparte came to
power, the same design was eontinued amI
the Ceres head simply replaced by the head
of the dictator. The first two values, 10c
and 25c, issued in December and August,
18:;2. respectively, still had the inscription
"REPUB. FRANC.", but when the monarchy
was proclaimed and the reign of Napoleon
III beg,an, "REPUB." was replaced in the
second half of 1853 by "EMPIRE", without
any other changes. In 1861, the emperor
orl1ered that he should be pictured in the
future with a laurel wreath on his head,
but only new values were issued in the new
design, the first one in 1863, while it took
for the old values until 1867-68, for the 1c
even until 1870, to become effective. For the
5c the change never took place, except on
proofs. 

The change of design was also useel to make some improvements in the frame.
The country name now was unabbreviated "EMPIRE FRANCAIS" and the meanders on both sides were made more distinct. For the values below 10c, a new design was ,adopted, with the same center as the higher values, but a simplified frame, without meanders on the sides and large figures of value in both bottom corners. This new design was introduced not only to make the value indication more conspicuous but also to prevent the future fraudulent transformation of low values into higher ones, as was reported for the 5c 1853, which had its color changed to blue and the figures of value altered into "20" by some industrious
people who wanted to cheat the postal service.

For a new high value, 5fr, a rectangular design, twice as wide as that of the lower
values, similar to that of contemporary revenue stamps, was created, with the same
center, meanders at left and right, "EMPIRE FRANCAIS" at top and "TIMBRE POSTE"
at bottom. The value indication was inserted at both sides of the center, "5" at left and
"F" at right. When the Ceres design was re-introduced, without change, first in 1870 for 10c, 20c anc1 40c, then in 1871 for 15c and 25c, the original design was used. The lithographed Bordeaux emergency issue of 1870 was also a rather accurate copy of the original Ceres design for the values from 10c to 80c, but the design of the values
below ]Oc was adapted similarly to the corresponding values of the laureated Napoleon
issue of 1863. 

After return to peacetime
conditions, in 1872, the values from
1c to 5c were issued in a design similar to
the corresponding values of the Bordeaux
issue. In the same year, another change took
place for the values from 10c to 80c, by
making the figures of value larger and
thicker, so that they beeame more conspicuous.
Only the 30c and 80c were immediately
issued with this change, while it took for
the 15c until 1873 and for the 10c until
1875. For the 25c and 40c the change did
not take place any more. The value indications,
by the way, had their particularities.
On the stamps in the original Ceres design
as well as with the unlaureated Napoleon
head and the provisional Bordeaux issue,
the value indieation on each side included
three dots, the bottom line of the stamps
read, for example, "·5· C' POSTES .5' C,''.
The value indication for the 1£1' value was
"'I'FR'" on the 1849 issue and "'l'F'"
on the 1853 issue. The value indication of
the 1863 issue showed only one dot each,
for example "20C'POSTES' 20C". For the
enlarged figures of the 1872 stamps in the
Ceres design, first, for the 15c, the same
arrangement with three dots as for the
1849 issue was tried, but this proved too
crowded and for the 10c one dot on each side was eliminated, "'10C'POSTES '10C''';
for the 30c and 80c the one-dot system of
the 1863 issue again was chosen. - The
Ceres design w,as the work of the engraver
.T. •r. Barre. For the head of Napoleon III
H contemporary coin was used by the same
engraver as basis. The laureated Napoleon
design was created by A. Barre, son of
.T. .r. Barre. The copying of the Ceres
design for the Bordeaux emergency issue
was done by A. Dambourgez (20c, Type I)
and L. Yon (other stamps).
The postage due stamps have a rather
simple numeral design. The slightly ornamented
frame had the inscriptions colorless
on solid ground, "POSTES" at left and
right, "CHIFFRE" at top and "TAXE" at
bottom. The center-which was inserted in
type-cOllSists of inscriptions only, the value
indication in two lines, with "a percevoir"
(which means "to collect") below. The author
of the design is unknown. The designs of
the newspaper and telegraph stamps show
the imperial arms, the eagle, in the center.
On the newspaper stamps, the eagle is
framed by the insignia of the Legion of
Honor, with the imperial crown at top. It
is placed in a curved octagonal frame, which
has oak leaves in the corners and a stalk
of wheat on each side at top. The rectangular
frame shows "TIMBRE IMPERIAL" at top
and ".TOURNAUX" at bottom, in double
lined letters on horizontally lined ground.
The value indication is in the bottom corners,
above ".TOURNAUX". The inscription "Timbre
Imperial" characterizes the stamps officially
as revenue stamps and the same
frame was in later years used extensively
for other kinds of revenue stamps. The
telegraph stamps show the arms as crowned
imperial eagle, with thunderbolts in its claws,
similar to the arms used previously in the
designs of v,arious revenue stamps. Placed
in a double oval inner frame, it shows,
colorless on solid ground, "EMPIRE FRANCAIS"
at top and "TELEGRAPHES" at
bottom. The corners of the simple rectangular
frame are filled in at top on each side
by a bee-which symbol was used by both
N,apoleons as representing the "working
classes"-and at bottom by value indications.
The designs for the newspaper and telegraph
stamps were both the work of the engraver
E. A. Oudine.

France employed four printing establishments for the manufacture of its stamps,
thrce of thcm in Paris and one, used only
during the emergency of 1870-71, in Bordeaux.
The National (from 1852 to 1870
Imperial) Mint of Paris manufactured in
a special department all postage stamps
except the emergency stamps of 1870-71, the
Imperial (from 1870 National) Printing
Works of Paris all postage due stamps
except the emergency issue of 1870-71, and
the Atelier General du Timbre of Paris all
newspaper and telegraph stamps, while the
Xational Mint of Bordeaux produced in
1870-71 an emergency issue of postage
stamps and postage due st,amps. Generally,
these establishments did the complete job,
from the manufacture of the printing material
to the printing, gumming and perforating
of the stamps. Only the Paris
Mint and, to a somewhat lesser degree, the
Atelier du Timbre, were well equipped for
the manufacture of stamps, while the Paris
Imperial Printing Works had much less
suitable facilities and the Bordeaux Mint
was not at all able to deliver typographed
stamps and had to substitute lithography
for the emergency issue it was commissioned
to provide. Aside from the lithographed
Bordeaux emergency issue-a complete set
of postage stamps from 1c to 80c and a
15c postage due st,amp-and the first printing
of the 10c postage due stamp in 1859
by the Imperial Printing Works, which was
also lithographed, all stamps were typographed
and letter-press printed.

For the typographed postage st.amps, thc
original elies were cut in steeL Sueh dies
were manufactured only for the issues 1849,
1852 and 1863, for the last issue three
different ones, for the values 1c to 5e, 109;
to 80e and 5fr, with the same head engraving
transferreel to all three. The master dies
for these three issues showed the complete
designs, with all inscriptions except the
value indication on both sides of the woril
"POSTES", which remained blank. The basic
design of the 5fr 1863 had no value indication
and therefore the die was complete.

For the 1853 issue, no new master die was
made, but that of the 1852 issue used and
jnly the inscription at the top altered to
"EMPIRE FRANC.". For the lithographed
postage stamps of 1870 (Bordeaux), first one
die-for the 20e-was cut in wood (Type I),
then another die for the 20c engraved on
stone (Type II). Both were complete illeluding value indic-ations. Frames only were
engraved on stone for the other values, as
wellas for the definite 20c (Type III). For
the postage due stamps of 1859, the design
of the frame only was cut in wood, a process
which was repeated in 1870 for the lithographed
15e, for which a similar woodcut
was made. For the newspaper as well as the
telegraph stamps, a master die was cut in
steel for each, complete except for the value
indications,-The dies for the postage stamps
were made for the 1849 and 1852 issue by
J. J. Barre, for the 1863 issue by A. Barre.

The engraver of the frame for the postage
due stamps is unknown. The first woodcut
for the lithographed issue of 1870, of the
20c, Type I, was executed by A. Dambourgez
who probably also made the woodcut of the
15e postage due stamp. The other values,
which were engraved on stone, the whole
ilesign of the 20c, Type II, and the frames
of all other values and of the 20e Type III
-were the work of the engraver L. Yon. The
dies for the newspaper and telegraph stamps
were made by the engraver E. A. Oudine.
In several e.ases, the engravers put their
initials or their name in the design of the
stamps. On the 1852 issue, a small "B"
below the bust of Napoleon stands for
Barre; it was removed for the 1853 issue.
On the lithographed stamps of 1870 we find
on all values, except the 20c in Type I, the
name YON inserted in very small letters
at the right side of the leaf which is on top
of the bunch of grapes on the Ceres head.
The newspaper and telegraph stamps show
the name OUDINE, the former in the center
above the inscription JOURNAUX, the latter
below the eagle.
In three cases, master dies for typographed
stamps were retouched. The first
case concerns that of the 1849 issue, which
was altered by removing a small shading
line in the corner of the mouth. This was
done after the matrix for the die of the
20c was cast; therefore only this one valne
has the shading line, more or less distinctly,
while it is missing on all other values. The
second retouched master die was that for
the 1853 issue. The retouch affected the hair
of the head, especially the curls in front of
the ear, which were made more curved, a
curl at the top of the head, which now
consists of two thin lines instead of one
thick line, and the shading of the neck,
,vhich now covers part of the previously
blank space below the ear, where the lines
now run throngh instead of being broken in
the middle. This retouch must have been
made late in 1859, as the die of the 1c,
w'hich was issued early in 1860, already
shows the retonched type. In 1860, new
dies of the 10c and 20c were made by using
the l'etouched die. These two values therefore
came imperforate in both types (Types
I and II), perforated in Type II only,
while 5c, 25c, 40c, 80c and 1fr came only
in Type I and lc only in Type II, imperforate
as well as perforated. The third case
concerns the master die of the 1863 issue.

The two dots, before and after POSTES,
were originally small and were made thicker
late in 1861, creating a second type. The
dies of the 30c and 40c were cast from the
master die with sm.all dots, that of the
80c from the retouched die with thick dots.
The first dies of 10c and 20c were taken
from the master die with small dots
(Type I), but in 1868 new dies were made
other values, 15c, 30c and SOc, the whole
bottom tablet of the design, including the
two corner ornaments, was removed in the
same way and the whole tablet-inscription
and corner ornaments-engraved for each
of the three values separately in the solid
ground, with the word POSTES and the two
"0" also conspicuously taller than on the
original design. The dies for the low values
of the 1863 issue, 1c, 2c and 4c, as well as
an unissued 5c, originated from a master
die with blank spaces instead of the value
indications, which were inserted in working
dies. For the dies of the Ie, 2c, 4c and 5c
1872, the dies of the corresponding values
of the 1863 issue were adapted, by changing
the top inscription and the head by way of
working dies. The value indication "5F"
of the 5fr 1863 was not included in the
design, but inserted in a second printing
operation. It seems that "5F" was set up
in type and used as die. Two types, one
with "5F" 4mm, the other 4~mm, are distinguished
by some specialists, but we consider
this more the result of an illusion or
to be accidental printing varieties. The dies
for the lithographed emergency issue of
1870 were obtained by transferring the
head of the 20c (Type II) into the frames
of the other values, to make the designs
complete. Only for the 20c, Type III, no
such die was created, which fact will be
discussed when the manufacture of the
printing material is explained.
For the postage due stamps, the dies
were obtained by type-setting the inscriptions
in a working die of the frame. But
only for the 10c, typographed and lithographed,
and for the lithographed 15c, such
dies were obtained, while for the typographed
15c the die of the typographed 10c was used
and only the figure changed in a working
die. For the 25c, 30c, 40c and 60c originally
no dies were made, but the change of the
figures of value achieved during the manufacture
of the printing material, which we
will discuss in a later paragraph. Only in
1873 a die was made for the 25c by changing
the figure in a working die of the 15c. For
the newspaper and telegraph stamps, the
dies of the specific values were created by
cutting the value indications into the appropriate
spaces of working dies taken from
the master dies.

The die of the 25c in the Ceres design deteriorated during the intense use from
1871 on and three stages of this deterioration-
which shows primarily in the corner
ornaments-can be distinguished. They are
considered by some authors wrongly as types.
The three stages come in different plates
or settings, but stages II and III are also
known from the same setting, se-tenant, as
result of the replacement of worn cliches
by new ones. Other dies also suffered through
wear and tear various defects during their
use, but they are very small and usually
cannot be used for distinguishing the various
plates.
The dies for the lithographed emergency
issue of 1870 were the subject of various
l-etouches, which extended only to the values
up and including 10c. The die of 1c was
the subject to two consecutive retouches,
while the dies of 2c, 4c, 5c and 10c were
retouched once. The retouches are mostly
rather small and not very conspicuous. Only
on the 10c the retouch, consisting mainly
of a thickening of the inner line of tho
frame in the spandrels-----similar to the retouch
made in the original die of the 20c,
Type III-is more obvious. In other cases,
the white line separating the back of the
head from the background was either
strengthened or removed.
To obtain the printing materia,l for the
typographed postage stamps, manufactured
by the Paris Mint, a method was used which
we encounter rarely for classic typographed
stamps, but which was in later years used
more frequently, in a somewhat modified
way. From the original die of each value, as
many matrices in guttapercha or other suitable
materi.al were taken as the plate should
contain stamps. These were arranged into
panes and electrotyped, resulting in plates
of panes which were mounted on a base to
make them "fit for printing. Each pane was
an entity and contrary to the settings of
single cliches, favored at that time for typograplJed
stamps, such plate remained intact
after each printing and cleaning, each individual
design staying in the same position
for all printings from the particular plate.
This method of production of the printing
material, although a technically advanced
one, did not always prove economical, especially
when single designs of some plates
became worn and their removal or improvement
was a bothersome job. This seems to be the reason why after 1870 not only such
plates were used for the printing but also
some settings assembled from single cliches,
allowing the easy replacing of worn cliches
and therefore keeping the printing material
usable longer.
The printing stones for the lithographed
stamps, manufactured at the Bordeaux Mint,
were obtained from the original dies (all
three types of 20c) or from the dies (other
values) by way of transfer stones. These
contained for the 1870 emergency postage
stamps 15 (5x3) designs and 10 (5x2) designs
for the 15c postage due stamp of
the same issue. The transfer stones were
obtained by transferring the design of the
dies by the usual lithographic procedure to
a stone. Only for the 20c, Type III, for
which no die was made, the original die of
the frame w,as used in the same way and
then the center of the original die of the
20c, Type II, with the Ceres head, transferred
individually into each of the 15
frames. The printing stones were obtained
by so many lithographic transfers from the
transfer stones as the stone needed to be
complete. The transfer stones of the postage
stamps were either obtained from the original
or the retouched original die or dies,
which leads to three different transfer
stones for 1c and 20c, Type II, two different
ones for 2c, 4c, 5c, 10c, 20c, Type I, and
20c, Type III, as well as one transfer stone
only for 30c, 40c and 80c. Some retouching
also was done on the individual designs of
the transfer stones - in French called
"reports"-which makes it easier to identify
the 15 "transfer types" of each value and
transfer stone. In both transfer stones of
the 20c, Type III, as result of the process
by which they were obtained, the Ceres head
is in a slightly different position on each
transfer type.

For the postage due stamps, which were
the product of the Imperial (National)
Printing Works of Paris, somewhat different
methods of manufacture were used for the
printing material. The first stamp, the 10c
of 1859, owing to lack of other suitable
facilities, had to be produced by way of
lithography. A transfer stone of 6 designs
in a horizontal strip was obtained from the
die and the printing stone manufactured
by making the necessary transfers frol11 the .necessary installations for typography
were completed and early in 1859, a setting
of the 10c assembled which consisted of
single sterotypes taken from the die. Late
in 1859, another change took place, a new
setting, now consisting of single electrotypes
was put into use. The first printing material
used for the 15c 1863 was also a setting of
single electrotypes, but late in 1864, another
step was made to improve the manufacture
of the printing material by using block
matrices of 10 (5x2), from which elecrotypes
-called "planche-mere"-were taken, as an
intermediary step for the assembly of the
plate. For the new values of 25c, 40c and
60c, such electrotyped blocks of the 15c,
consisting of 20 (5x4) designs, were taken,
the figure "15" removed in each design and
the new figures inserted. As the position of
these new figures varied slightly for each
of the 20 designs, there exist actually 20
types of each value. The necessary electros
taken from these adapted block matrices
were used for assembling the plates. For
the 30c of 1878, probably the same method
was used, but possibly also another, still
more advanced method, which was introduced
middle of 1873 for the 25c. It was similar
to that employed by the Paris Mint for
the postage stamps, by using a die made
for this value, arranging the necessary
number of matrices to a pane and electrotyping
them, to manufacture plates of panes
which were mounted on a base.
The manufacture of the printing material
for the newspaper and telegraph stamps by
the Atelier General du Timbre probably
followed the same methods as were used for
the contemporary postage stamps by the
Paris Mint, but no detailed information
seems to be available in this regard.
The size of the plates and stones for all
postage stamps, including the lithographed
emergency issue but excepting the large size
5fr, was uniform. The printing forms consisted
of two panes of 150 (10x15) each,
side by side. Only in a few cases-for example
the first printings of the Ifr 1849
-single panes of 150 (10x15) seem to have
been used as plates. On the other hand, for
the most needed values, especially 20c and
25c, plates of panes for more than one print·
ing form were made and these often used in
different combinations, the same plates some·
times used for' th"e left pane of one printing form and later for the right pane of another
one. These combinations enable to distinguish
different printings of some values; no
less than nine such combinations are known
for example of the 25c of 1871. At the end
of the classic stamp period, in the early
Seventies, a number of plates in double
size, containing four panes of 150 (10x15)
in ,a block, were manufactured, to make more
efficient use of the mechanical flat presses
which had been in use for a few years in
addition to the hand presses. The 5fr stamps,
design as well as value indication, were
printed from plates of 150, consisting of
two panes of 75 (5x15), side by side. For
the first postage due stamp, the lithographed
10c, the size of the stone is not known, but
old reports make it probable, that it consisted
of 120 stamps in three panes, side
by side, the center pane having 60 (12x5)
designs and the two others 30 (6x5) designs
each. The settings of the first typographed
postage due stamps, namely the 10c and
the first setting of the 15c, consisted of
500 (25x20) stamps, which were not divided
into panes. Later settings of the 15c and all
settings of the 25c, 30c, 40c and 60c consiste(
1 of 150 stamps, in three panes of 50
(5x10), side by side. It is claimed that the
complete setting actually consisted of 300
stamps, two such groups of 150, probably
in tete beche position. The stone of the
lithographed 15c had the same arrangement,
150 or 300 stamps respectively. A peculiar
ar1'angement was used for the newspaper
stamps. These stamps were to be pasted on
the paper before the newspapers were
printed, their cancellation being effected by
heing oVeI'printed with newspaper text. To
account for the loss of stamps when printing
the newspapers, due to printer's waste,
the publishers obtained 101 stamps for the
price of 100. In accordance with this discount
of 1%, the plates consisted of 202
designs, two panes of 101 each, side by side
(10x10), with the additional 101st design
below the 100th design on the left pane
and below the 91st design on the right pane.
The telegraph stamps were printed from
plates of 100 (10x10).

The spacing was quite even for all postage
stamps, about l.5mm., horizontally as well
as vertically. The spacing was wider for the
postage due stamps, namely about. 2% to spacing of t.he lithographed 10c postage
due st.amps was 2mm., while the lithographed
1.5c had a somewhat irregular spacing, from
1mm. to l;/,mm. The newspaper stamps were
spaced about. 2;/,mm. and the telegraph
stamps ubout l;/,mm. between horizontal
1'OWS and about 2mm. between vertical columllS.
The width of the gutter between the
panes for the stamps in the Ceres design was
about 18nl1n. and 21;/,mm. for the 1853
issue. On the typographed postage due
stamps, the gutters were 21mm. for the 15c
and only 5mm. for the 25c, 30c, 40c and 60c
On the lithographed 15c, the gutter was
10n11n. wide.
The plates generally had no margin print,
except from 1852 to 1856, when the panes of
the typographed postage stamps had a
single border line about 8mm apart (Fig.
55). All panes of 10e and 25c 1852 and of
25c and Ifr 1853 had this border line, while
the panes of 5c, 10c (Type I), 20c (Type
I), 40e and 80c first had border lines and
from 1856 no lines; the panes of 1c, 10c
(Type II) and 20c (Type II), which were
all issuP(1 after 1856, never have border lines.
'When preparations for perforating the postage
stamps were officially made in 1862,
two small crosses were added to the panes,
above the 5th stamp at top and below the
145th stamp at bottom, as guide for the
perforating process. All plates used for
perforated stamps of the 1852, 1863 and
1870-75 issues have these crosses, but the
last plates used for the imperforate Ie, 5c,
20c Jmd 80c 1853 have them too. The 5fr
] 8fi3 had the crosses above the 3rd and
below the 73rd stamp.

Some of the stones of the lithographed
emergency postage stamps of 1870-71, up
to and including the 20c, but not all, had
on the outer side of a pane, at top or at plate numbers. 'l'hey run from 1 to 15,
including a Roman II, and generally each
mlue comes with different numbers. It
ReemR that these stones were numbered in
order of their manufacture, regardless of
denomination.
One of the most attractive features of the
dassic France stamps is the existence of a
numher of inverted designs in some of the
plates, which resulted in tete beche multiples.
It has been argued whether these inverted
(Iesigns, caused by matrices inserted in
inverted position during the assembling of
the plates, were put in pnrposely or acddentally.
Considering the fact that-with
one exception-always only one of the panes
of a plate contained tete beches, either one
or three, only in one O,)lse two, and that
after 1863 no new plate included inverted
(fesigns, we tend to the opinion that the
peculiar arrangement of some plates was
purposely made. As the official files give
no information, all speculation about the
reason for this measure must remain guesswork,
possibly they were simply used for
easier identification of the printed panes.
Of the 1849 issue, panes of five values had
inverted designs (Fig. 56). The 10c had
three (positions 27, 58 and 145), the 15c,
25c and Ifr one each (positions 80, 131 and
35 respectively), all on left panes, while
the 20c comes in different combinations
with one (position 93) on a left pane or
three (positions 92, 110 and 148) on a right
pane, the latter also used for the unissued
20c blue. There are no tete beches known
of the 1852 issue, but panes of three values
of the 1853 issue show inverted designs
(Fig. 57), namely 20c either one (positions
20, 51 or 90, perforated only) or two
(positions 10 and 30, perforated and imperforate,
the latter from unfinished sheets
of the perforated issne), 80c one (position
HiO, imperforate and perforated) on a right
pane. and Ifr (position 131) on the left
and right pane. Of the 1863 issue, only one
boHom, small figures, which are considered
2;/,mm. for the typographed stamps. Th
this transfer stone. After a short period, pane of the 4c had an inverted design
(position 25), on a right pane. When the
plates of the 1849 issue were put in use
again in 1870, the inverted designs can be
found in the same positions as in the 1849
issue for the 100, 15c and 25c (Fig. 58). For
the 20c also panes with different positions
of invertefl designs were found, either one
(position 128) or three (positions 101, 119
and 148), all on left panes. They were
possibly reserve plates not used in 1849-52,
as newly made plates had generally no
inverted designs.
Two major plate err01'S occurred during
the classic stamp period by insertion of
matrices of another value in plates of two
values. In the first case, the error was
f1etected and corrected before the printing
started, while in the second case detection
was made only after sheets with the error
wore distributed to the post offices and
partly used up. When the plate of the 40c
] 849 was prepared, two matrices of the 20c
slipped in one of the assembled panes, which
was only detected after the electrotyped
printing plates were made. To make them
usable, the figures of value in the two
designs of the wrong value, which occupied
positions 146 and 147 in a right pane, were
changed, by filling in the two wrong figures
"2" with type-metal and engraving "4"s in
their place. The two re-engraved stamps are
recognizable not only by the shape of the
"4" which is wider-on position 146 more
distinct than on position 147-but also by
the fact that they show the shading line in
the corner of the mouth; this line was
removed before the die of the 40c was made
and can be distinctly found on 20c stamps,
which were the only valne derived from the
original die before retouching. The second
error occurred in the 1872-75 issue with
thiek figures, when a cliche of 15c slipped
into a setting of 10c, in position 90 of a
pane. This resulted in an error 15c brown on
rose instead bistre on white, which also comes in multiples with the regular 10c
brown on rose (Fig. 59). The first copies
of the error appeared early in 1875; it was
detected shortly after, the stiH available
sheets with the error having been withdrawn
from the post offices and the setting corrected
by replacing the wrong 15c cliche
with a correct 10c cliche.
In a few cases, we can find a slight
doubling of some designs which is due to
partial double entry when the matrices were
made. Such varieties were, for example,
found in one pane of the 5fr, in six positions
(9, 13, 21, 22, 28 and 72), which show the
bur!Jlage in the top left part of the design
distinctly doubled. Doubling of the outer
frame line may also be the result of reentries,
but usually is a sign of wear, which
made the edges of some cliches rise and
printing as lines parallel to the frame lines.
A number of plates suffered, partly due
to extensive use, more or less serious damages,
especially in some margin designs.
Plate flaws are numerous, especially for the
20c and 25c values, which were printed in
great quantities. Certain of these plate flaws,
which have attractive features, have become
popular and acquired kinds of nick names,
for example 25c and 40c 1849 "a la barbe",
20c 1863 "a la corne", lc 1863 "a la cigarette",
etc. A rather gener,al occurrence, especially
on margin stamps, are broken frame
lines, the breaks sometimes affecting the
design of the frame. Due to the fact that
defective designs could not easily be replaced
in the plates-which would have been
easy if only settings of single cliches were
used-plates with defective designs were
used over long periods and only when the
damage became too obvious, the plate was
withdrawn from further use. In a few cases,
the printer tried to recover such platesand
also plates with faults which occurred
during the manufacture-by filling in the defeetive
parts with type-metal and attempting
:t retouching job, which, although often
rather clumsely done, seemed satisfactory.
Such retouched plates, with single designs more or less conspicuously retouched, can be
found primarily of lc (imperforate and perforated)
and 25c 1853, 20c 1863 and 25c
1871. So-called "errors", "20" instead of "25"
at left on 25c 1871, "30" instead of "80" at
right on 80c 1872 and similar ones, are not
even plate flaws, but accidental printing
flaws, due to hardened ink which fiHed some
parts of the recessed inscriptions. There
were numerous individual retouches on the
lithographed stamps of 1870, which are
more or less conspicuous. They were partly
made before the printing started, in part
later to improve worn designs. They concern
either the inscriptions or the head; especially
the line behind the head has either been
strengthened or removed. Some retouched
figures are conspicuous, for example 40c
with broad "4", and 80c with the "80" at
right reading "88", etc.
In rather sharp contrast to the advanced
methods of procuring the printing material,
the methods of printing were rather oldfashioned.
As a general rule, the stamps
were printed on hand presses and only at
the end of the classic period, in the early
Seventies, a few steam-driven flat presses
came additionally into use for the postage
stamps. The printing was rather careful
for the 1849 and 1852 issue, due to expert
make-ready, and less well printed stamps
are exceptions. Only for one printing of the
40c 1849 the make-ready does not seem to
have been applied properly and the appearance
of the stamps is worn, similar to the
stamps printed after 1870 from the same
plates. Generally, the make-ready was very
influential for the appearance of all issues.
It shows usually in the medallion with the
head, where strengthening or disappearance
of shading lines, especially on the neck, is
due to the application of positive or negative
make-ready. The make-ready is responsible
for a characteristic occurrence, lined ground
of the medallion, horizontally or vertically,
in exceptional cases horizontally and vertically
or diagonally. There have been several
theories advanced for this lined ground--":'

a peculiarity, which, by the way, can also
be found on typographed issues of other
countries during the same period, for example
Greece, large Hermes heads, and
Austria, 1867 issue-but we believe that the
surface stmcture of the material for the
make-ready, which in the specific cases \vas either ribbed paper or ribbed felt, was
responsible for the phenomenon of "lined
gronnd". The "lines", more or less strongly
pronounced, some times not only show in
the medallion, but also in other solid parts
of the design, for example, the tablets with
the inscriptions. The "lined medallion" variety
can be found rather frequently on the
1870-75 issue, somewhat less frequently on
the 1863 issue and the perforated 1853 issue,
while it is scarce on the imperforate 1853
issue and rare on the 1849 and 1852 issues.
For the issues from 1853, the printing was
nather uneven; very fine printings as well
as quite coarse ones can be found, not only
due to more or less careful make-ready but
also due to careful or careless printing.
Combined with the natural wear of the
plates during their long period of use,
printings from the same plates sometimes
look strikingly different, especially obvious
for the Ceres design, where the imperforate
1849 issne generally is an example of careful
make-ready and printing, while the printings
made from the same plates twenty years
Later for the 1870-72 issue usually have a
worn and much less careful appearance.
This makes it rather easy to distinguish the
imperforate varieties as well as the stamps
issued imperforate for the colonies after
1870 from the imperforate stamps of the
1849 issue. Overinked prints, which make
the inscriptions almost disappear as well as
prints which, due to faulty inking, show
parts of the design incompletely printed,
occasionally can be found of the issues
from 1853. The 1870 lithographed emergency
issue, due to the haste in which it was
printed, is distinguished by many badly
printed stamps and really fine prints are
exceptions, which especially are characteristic
only for 2c (from the first transfer
stone, erroneously previously called "Tours
Printing") and 30c. The usual minor printing
varieties also can be observed on stamps
of all issues, for example slight shifts during
the printing, resulting in doubling of parts
of the design, etc. Offsets are rather scarce
due to the use of hand presses and clear ones
only can be found on the Last printings of
the classic period, made on flat presses.
'rhere were few major printing varieties
hceause checking of the finished sheets
sepms to have been careful and misprinted
sheets rejected by the controllers. We know of only two stamps in real double prints,
namely 80c 1853 and 10c Bordeaux, of which
used copies are reported. The 30c of the
Bordeaux issue is reported in a partial
double print. Several values of the Bordeaux
issue are reported printed on both sides,
namely 4c, 10c (transfer type I), 20c,
Type II, and 20c, Type III. A curious
v,ariety is reported of the 80c 1853, namely
with Ifr 1853 on the reverse side. Two used
copies are known, one even with parts of
two Ifr in tete beche position on the back.
It is claimed, that a 80c sheet by error was
printed on a Ifr sheet from printer's waste,
hut this seems very unlikely because the
two stamps were not printed concurrently
and we must seriously question the genuiness
of this variety. A double print of the
design is also reported of the 10c typogr,
aphed postage due stamps, but the description
suggests that it is a shift, not a
real double print. Of the only stamp which
was printed in two printing operations, the
5fr 1863, a major printing error is known,
namely copies without value indication, coming
from a sheet which either completely
or partly escaped the second printing operation,
which added the value indication to
the design. One unused and three used copies
are known, all caucelled in Paris and all
more or less defective (Fig. 60).
The paper of all stamps was machinemade
aud of medium thickness. But some
thick to very thick paper, as well as very
thin paper, to almost pelure, can be found
occasionally for some values and is sought
after by specialists. The paper had no
watermark, but parts of the papermaker's
watermark of Lacroix Freres, a paper mill of
Angouleme, reading "LACROIX FRERES"
or "LA + FRERES" in two lines, have been
found in a few cases as exceptions on single
stamps. Stitch watermarks also exist, but
they are scarce.

The use of colored or tinted paper for the
postage stamps is one of the characteristic
features of the stamps of France. Generally,
it was intended to print all stamps on paper which was tin ted or colored in a shade similar
to that in which the printing was done,
hence, blne stamps on bluish paper, red
stamps on Tose paper, etc. This was actually
done and the paper, colored or tinted
through, must have been especially prepared
for each value. The most distinct colored
papers used were buff to brownish buff
(20c 1849, later all 2c), bluish (all 1c and
20c 1853), greenish (all 5c) and rose (all
80c and 10c of 1873). But aside from that,
almost all stamps come from certain printings
also on white or yellowish paper, the
latter often not a basic coloring of the
paper, but due to the influence of the gum.
The shade of the paper is difficult to
ascertain, especially for used stamps, as the
color of the paper may have changed due
to soaking or accidental chemical influence.
The underprint - see next paragraph - is
sometimes also deceiving. In a few cases,
paper was used for a wrong value, either
in error or due to lack of the correct paper.
This was the case for the 20c of 1853
(Type I and II), which, probably by error,
in 1855 and 1861 was also printed on the
greenish paper of the 5c, and for the 5c of
the same issue, which during the emergency
of 1871 was printed on the bluish paper of
the 1c. In other cases, paper of a more or
less dissimilar color must have been delivered
by the papermakers, but the official files
also report cases where paper, delivered by
the papermakers in correct color, changed
through the influence of the gum to a different
shade or color. Especially the 20c 1853
must have been the subject of such accidents,
because it exists from specific printings
'llso on violet and rose paper.
The paper, as delivered by the manufacturers,
was not directly used for printing
of the stamps, but it obtained first a solid
underprint in lithography, which was intended
to make manufacture of imitations
of the stamps more difficult. This underprint,
which was printed with plain varnish,
should have been colorless, but it frequently
had a grayish, yellowish or even brownish
tint, which makes stamps printed on such
paper look like stamps on yellowish or buff
paper, which was especially true for the
first printings of the 20c 1849. The color
of the underprint also often influenced
noticeably the printing ink, so that stamps
printed with the same ink on paper with (lifferently tinted underprint look very different.
The underprint did not cover the
whole sheets of paper but was only an area
a little bit largel' that the printing plates,
se that its existence becomes more or less
clearly visible on the sheet margins. Only
the paper for all postage stamps including
the emergency issue of 1870, the newspaper
and telegraph stamps had the underprint,
while the postage dne stamps which could
not be userI by the public were left without
it. After receiving the unrIerprint, the paper
in the top right corner received a handstamped
control marlc. First, a marking
"C.F." (Controle Franchises) in a small oval
(12Yzx7mm.) was used, in black or blue,
which can be found on the sheets of the
1849 and 1852 issues, as well as the first
printings of the 1853 issue. From 1854,
another marking, showing "Controle" ani!
the letters "T.P." (meaning Timbres-Poste)
in a small oval (15x8mm., Fig. 61), was
userI, always in blue, but it is also reporterI
in red on the HI' 1853. Both markings can
be found either on the top sheet margin
near the top right corner or, usually inverted,
on the bottom sheet margin near
the bottom left corner. The postage due
stamps had the control mark mostly on the
right margin of a pane. In some cases, the
handstamp was placed too far inside the
sheet anit then can be found partly, in extreme
cases completely on stamps, an occurrence
which is appreciated by the specialists.
The Color Scheme used by France for its
stamps was a conservative one and once a
color was adopted for a rate the stamps
which covered this rate were always of this
same color. The stamp for the single letter
rate was to be blue and this color was used,
l"'f!anllcss of whether the rate was 20c or
25c. Only for the first 1Yz years, the 20c
stamp, although the proofs were in blue, was rinted in black for reasons of expediency,
becanse black stamps could be printed faster
than blue ones. Otherwise all 20c and 25c
RtampR from 1850 to 1876 were blue. The 10c
Rtamp for the loc.al single letter rate was
bistre brown and continued in this color
until 1871, when this rate was increased to
15c and the 15c value took over the same
color. The color of the Ifr 1849 was originally
a pale brownish vermilion, called
"rouge terne", but rather distinct variations,
to a bright vermilion on the one hand and
to a brownish carmine on the other hand
,yere ,already among the first printings, used
in January 1849. The color of the first 40c
of 1850 was orange, a color retained for all
following 40c of the classic period; but as
this color was too similar to the vermilion
shades of the Ifr, the eolor of the latter
was officially changed by decree of Dec. 1,
1849 to carmine. Carmine was also kept for
the Ifr 1853 and, after the Ifr was replaced
by the 80c in 1854, adopted by this latter
value and, from 1860 in somewlJat lighter
and more rose sllades, continued for all 80c,
until the end of the classic period. The
first 15c stamp of 1850 was green and after
this value w.as abolished, its color was taken
oyer in 1854 by the 5c which retained it far
lwyond the end of the classic period. The
lc stamps were all olive green, the 2c stamps
rdl brown, the 4c stamps gray and the 30c
Rtamps brown. The 5fr 1863 was printed in
,llra.y lilac, and the value indication added
in a similar, somewhat darker color. When
the 10c was re-introduced in 1873. it was
printed in light brown, but rose paper was
used to provide an easier distinction from the
] 5c. This was the only case where the color
of the p,aper was used to accentuate the
color difference between two values. Otherwise,
the tinting or coloring of the paper wa s
mainly used for aesthetic reasons, to improve
the appearance of the stamps. An even
more conservative trend is visible in the color
Reheme of the postage due sta,mps. The color
of the stamp whieh eolleeted dues on a
single letter was always black, whieh 0.0101'
first was used for the 100., then the 15c, the
25c and eventually the 300.. The stamps
collectiug postage due on double and triple
lC'ttprs, introducpd in 1871, werp blue (40c)
and ye770w bistre (60c). When in 1878 the
aouble mte waR increaRed to 60c, this value
was re-isRued in the blue color of the abolisher1 40c. For the newspaper stamps, only
the franking value was indicated by different
colors, while the two different denominations,
represpnting the tax of 2c and 5c, had
in each group the same color. The pure
fiscal 2c and 5c without franking value
were lilac, the 2c and 5c with 2c franking
yalup were blue and the 2c aud 5c with 40
franking value were rose. The color scheme
of the telegraph stamps was carmine, green,
orange and lila,c.
Generally, mineral and vegetable inks were
used for the printing of the stamps, but it
R('emR that littl(' importance was attaehed
to the application of uniform colors. This
len to numerous ,and sometimes quite Rtriking
RhadeR for many stamps. The blue color ean
be found from a milky blue through various
Rhades to a blackish blue, especially on the
20c 1853. In some cases, more or less distinct
ultramarine shades OCi3urred occasionally,
gellPrally being rare. This was the case for
all tbrpp types of the 20c Bordeaux iSRue,
of which Type II exists in a really distinct
ultramal'ine shade, while for the two other
typeR the ultramarine shades are leRs distinct
and often eonfused with more common pale
blue or other slightly off-color shades. The
40c postage dne stamp also exists in a rare
lig-ht ultramarine shade and the 40c and 60c
Rhow distinct prussian blue shades as searce
nll'ieties. The bistre brown of the 10c stamps
tends rather Rtrongly to greenish, yellowish
-even pure ypllow for the 10c 1853-and
brownish shades, the carmine of the 80c
Rhows also eonsiderable variations into vermilion
and rose carmine. The orange of the
40c v,aries from yellow to orange vermilion,
in the emergency issne of 1870 it shows
Rtill greater variety and tends to pure
wrmilion and blood red shades. A characteristic
de~p blood red Rhade, called "rougesang",
is rare and much in demand by
specialists. 

Frequently, more common blood
red shades are misrepresented as this much
rarer shade. The green of the 15c has only
small variations, but when it was adopted
by the 50. it tended to greater variety and
in 1860 its color officially was changed to
vellow green - because the original color
looked blue in artificial light, which also
Ip(1 to fraudulent changplings into the 20c
yalue-again with a nnmber of shaileR. The red brown to maroon-with a scarce chocolate
shade of the Bordeaux issue-and that
of the 30c from grayish brown to blackish
brown, while some of the shades of the 4c
had a distinctly lilac tint. The color of the
lilac gray 5fr w,as rather sensitive and
changed very easily to gray, greenish gray
or blnish gray; therefore not much importance
should be attached to these variations.
The color of the separately printed value
indication of this stamp tended to bluish
shades, sometimes, as an accidental variety,
being distinctly blue, possibly due to accidental
deterioration of the ink before printing.
The colors of the orange and brown
~tamps easily were subject to accidental
sulphurization which darkened them to
brownish shades and even made them completely
black; in such cases, the original
color can be restored quite easily with the
help of a solution of peroxide.
The ,qu,m used for all stamps was rather
pure arabic gum, which was originally colorless
and rather brilliant but became yellowish
or even brownish when aged. It was
applied by hand with brushes and the
streaks are sometimes clearly visible. The
gumming was done in some cases rather
carelessly and left small parts of the sheets
without gum, of which a small printing of
the 40c 1849 is a fine example, showing
brownish streaky gum, which covers only
two-thirds of the back of some stamps.
Until 1862,all postage stamps were issued
imperforate. The postage due stamps of
the classic period were all imperforate, while
of the newspaper and telegraph stamps
only the first printings put on sale were
imperforate. Of the telegraph stamps, all
four values were actually issued and used
imperforate, but of the newspaper stamps
only the 2c ( +2c) blue was issued and used
imperforate. It is claimed that the 2c (+4c)
rose also was issued imperforate, but as
only two used copies (overprinted with
newspaper text) are reported to be known,
there does not seem to be sufficient proof
for such a claim. In 1870-71, when an
emergency issue was printed at Bordeaux,
it was again issued imperforate, because no
perforating devices were available there.
Pri1'ate71/ ron7etted or perforated postage
stamps are rcportcil as early as from the
last years of the ns(' of the] 849 issne, bnt
oven if snch items shouM prove genuine-which does not seem certain at all-these
private separations were more of an accidental
and local nature. The first major
private efforts to facilitate separation of
the imperforate stamps can be recognized
during the use of the 1853 issue when in
1861 and 1862 such stamps with private
separation became numerous and widespread.
On Jan. 1, 1861, the stationery store of
Susse Freres at Paris started to use a
harrow perforating device which perforated
a block of 50(10x5) stamps in one operation.
The perforation was 7(7x8 perfs.), with
large holes of about l:)4mm. diameter. During
the same period, various kinds of roulettes-
dot and line, serpentine as well as
sawtooth (Fig. 62)-some of which are
characteristic for particular post offices,
were used to help separate the postage
stamps in Paris and other places, privately
but also often by the postmasters themselves.
In so far as such separations were applied
by the postmasters, they also can be found
on postage due stamps (Fig. 63). All these
private separations should be collected on
covers, or at least pieces, only, because off
cover no proof for their authenticity is
usually possible. Known are 1c, 5c, 10c, 20c,
40c and 80c of the 1853 postage stampsall
from 1860-61 printings only-with the
Susse perforation as well as rouletted in
lines and a few values also with saw tooth
roulette. Of the postage dues, the 10c and
] 5c (both lithographed and typographed),
as well as the 25c, 30c and 60c blue exist
ronletted in lines or perforated, 10c and
15c also sawtooth rouletted by the postmasters.
During the emergency of 1870-71, when
imperforate postage stamps-the Bordeaux
issue-were again used, private roulettes of
"adous kinds were introduced, but surprisingly
v th~ir use was by far l('ss widesprearl
than during the :years 1861 and 1862. All
value's are known rouletted in lines, while
only a few values are also reported with
olivee green 0.0101' of the ] c run in many
Rhanes to bronze green, that of thp 20 from sa,,'tooth roulettes, The authenticity of Ii
line perforation 13, which can be found on
all values, is questioned.
From October 1862, the postage stamps
started to be issued officially perforated.
A horizontal comb perforation 14x130
(14x16 perfs) was used for this and all
following issues of the classic stamp period,
'rhe perforating deviee applied the perforation
simultaneously to five or more stacked
panes of 150 (10x15), In each operation, one
horizontal row of ten was perforated on
three sides, so that sixteen operations were
needed to complete a pane, the last operation
providing the bottom perforation for the
last row of the pane and running through
the bottom sheet margin. For the larger
size 5fr of 1863, the same comb perforating
aevice was used but every second vertical
row of perfor.ations was removed, thereby
providing each pane of 75 (5x15) stamps
with a comb perforation 14x130 (28x16
perfs). The perforating was done for all
postage stamp issues at the Paris Mint. For
perforating the newspaper and telegraph
stamps, which were manufactured by the
Atclier General du Timbre at Paris, line
perforating devices were used, which applied
a line perforation 120, varying from
11% to 12%, to the full sheets of 202
stamps for the newspaper and 100 stamps
for the telegraph stamps. Of the former,
only the 2c (+2c) blue and the 2c (+4c)
rose were actually issued perforated. They
had nine perforated blank spaces in the
bottom row of each pane.
The perforating devices did not operate
very accurately and off center copies are
the rule among the classic stamps. The
narrow spacing of the stamps makes imperfect
perforation more obvious than on
other st,amps, because due to the slightest
shift the perforations cut the frame lines
and the design, making it look worse than
it actually is. Perfectly centered classic
stamps of France deserve a considerable
premium and the centering-minded collector
has a rather difficult job. The perforating
devices did not always work properly and
this resulted on the one hand in stamps
which are only 15 instead of 16 perfs high,
'J'his may have been done in some cases
pUl'posely, to alleviate the otherwise resulting
 off center conditions. On the other hand,
stamps with a broad bottom tooth on each side of the vertical perforation can be found,
mostly in the last row of the panes. In
extreme cases, strongly shifted perforations
exist, with the perforation running through
the center of the stamps. Of perforation
varieties, we oce,asionally find double perforations
which, when the second perforation
is shifted in one direction only, resulted in
so-called "diamond" perforation on two opposite
sides of the stamps. Several stamps
were reported in pairs, imperforate between
(20c 1863, 5c and 10c 1872), but as such
varieties are very unlikely for comb perforation,
we have every reason to believe that
they are fakes made from French Colonies
or imperforate France stamps. Covers with
such ,-arieties which were recorded, have
much too early dates-1860 and January
1862-to be genuine. Only one case is known
in which entire imperforate sheets were
issued by mistake, namely of the 20c 1863,
of which a number of imperforate sheets
in a milky blue shade were sent in April
1869 to Nancy and there used up, mainly
on corrsepondence of the firm Lebaudy
Frcres (Fig. 64). In all other cases of
imperforate stamps of the otherwise perforated
issues-1853 perforated, 1863 and
1870-75-they are either favor prints or
they come from government archives or
officials, connected with the manufacture
of the stamps, but were never issued at any
post office. France was the first country,
which manufactured favor prints, in 1869,
when by order of the Emperor the Paris
Banker Nathaniel de Rothschild obtained
a number of imperforate sheets of the then
current postage stamps-1c and 5c of the
perforated 1853 issue, 2c, 4c, 10c (Type I),
20c (Type I), 30c, 40c and 80c of the 1863
issue-for the collection of his son, Arthur
de Rothschild. These favor prints, of which
supposedly 600 to 700 copies each were provided,
were valid for postage and a few of them seem to have been used by the
Rothschild family on their mail. The 1c and
5c of this "Rothschild Issue" can be distinguished
from the corresponcling values
of the imperforate 1853 issue only by the
printing and by the shades. In the same
way, the 5c, as well as the 30c and 80c arc
distinguishable from the corresponding values
of the general issue for the French
Oolonies. It is sometimes rather difficult to
distinguish the imperforate stamps which
came from other sources, on the one hand
from the Rothschild favor prints, on the
other hand from the imperforate 1853 issue
and the general issues of the French 001onies.
"Ve know imperforate the 20c of 1862,
all values (incl. Ie and 5fr, as well as 10c,
Type II) of 1863, 1c, 2c, 4c, 5c and 10c of
1872, and the 80c thick figures of 1872, but
other values may exist, although only in a
few copies from the official files and having
more the character of proofs.
'['he sheets issued by the post offices were
generally panes of 150 for the postage
stamps. The post offices must have received
the sheets already divided into panes and
the few full sheets known of the imperforate
issues seem to come from official files or
officials connected with the printing of these
stamps. '1'he perforated postage stamps were
all separated into panes before the perforating
process and therefore can exist only
in panes. '1'he postage due stamps were supplied
to the post offices in sheets of 150,
except for the large sheets of 500 of the
10c and 15c typographed (first printing)
whieh were cut up into blocks of 260 (13x20)
and 240(12x20) before delivery to the post
offices.
'1'he forms for the postal cards were officially
printed and issued at the post offices
with pasted-on stamps. They were type-set
and printed in sheets of unknown size on
the letter press. '1'hey were first manufactured
by the National Printing Works of
Paris, but later, when larger quantities were
needed, also by private printing establishments.
There exist a rather great number
of printings, on white or buff thin card. The
first cards of January 1873 had no value
indication and came in two kinds, both on
white, one with space for two 5c stamps, one
below the other-because there was no 10c
stamp at that time-the other with space
for a 15c stamp. From February 1873 on. the cards were printed with value indications,
the 10e card on buff and now with space
for one stamp only, and the 15c earil on
\,hite..From .January 1, 1876, when tlle new
H.P.H. rates eame into force, uniform c.ards,
on "'hite Ol' buff, were introduceil, which
"'mId be useil for local, domestic or foreign
(lestinations. Only the officially issued cards
