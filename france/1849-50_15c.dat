\section{1849-50 15c}

During May 1850 the rates for tranmission of letters was changed. The internal rate up to 7 \half grams increased from 20 centimes to 25 centimes, effective from 1st July 1850. The internal rate for Paris was 15 centimes (Fig.~\ref{local}) and the internal town rate (except Paris) 10 centimes.

Only 3.3 million copies of the 15 centimes value were printed using two plates, so it is rare even as a single stamp. It exists in various shades of green the listed ones being (a) yellow-green, b) green, c) dark green and d) deep bottle green.

From the printer's records, it is known that 2.4 million stamps were printed using the
first plate, and only 900 thousand using the second plate. One \tete cliche occurred at position 80 of the second plate, so it can be estimated that only six thousand \tete pairs were printed.

This value was principally used for the local rate within Paris from July 1850 until June 1853, so it is rarely found in pairs. However, a 1 franc 30 centimes rate to the United States gave rise to the only unique \tete variety of France. Figure 2 shows a March 1852 double-weight cover front from Paris to New Orleans. Its 2 francs 60 centimes franking includes the only known (unused or used) \tete pair of the 1850 15 centimes stamp.

\ph[99%]{../france/15c-cover.jpg}{Unique 1850 15 centimes \tete pair on cover front to the United States (ex: Ferrary }

This cover has an interesting history. In 1896, it was brought to a leading Parisian dealer named Victor Robert by an American merchant who had a suitcase
packed with hundreds of covers addressed to the Lelievre firm in New Orleans. After several days of
sorting through the suitcase, Robert came across the \tete cover. He immediately called Count
Philipp la Renotiere von Ferrary, the leading collector of the day, who purchased the item for 7,500
francs, or four times the then-current price of a Post Office Mauritius stamp. Ferrary was greatly
concerned when the item's authenticity was later questioned, so the pair was removed from the cover
and placed in boiling water. When the pair surprisingly did not disintegrate, it was pronounced
genuine. The cover was illustrated in the November 1924 11th Ferrary sale, and was not seen in public again until the \textsc{PHILEXFRANCE 89} exposition.
