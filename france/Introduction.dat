# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of France

France was and is one of the great powers of Europe. When postage stamps were introduced
in 1849, it was a Republic; it became a Monarchy in 1852 and again a Republic in 1870. On the north, France bordered on [Belgium](../belgium/Introduction) and Luxembourg, on the east on the German States of Prussia (Rhine Province), Bavaria (Palatinate) and Baden, the Rhine forming the frontier between the last named and France, then Switzerland (Cantons of Basel, Bern, Neuchatel, Vaud and Geneve) and the Kingdom of Sardinia (Savoy and Piedmont). On the
south, the border was formed by the Mediterranean Sea, with the island of Corsica
belonging to France, and the Pyrenees Mountains, with Spain (Provinces of Navarre,
Aragon and Cataluna) on the other side of the Pyrenees and tiny Andorra
in between. The western border was the Atlantic Ocean (Bay of Biscay and English
Channel). In 1849, France covered 204,350 square miles, with 35 million inhabitants.

In 1860, after the acquisition of Savoy and Kizza, this increased to 212,650 sq. mi: with
a population of 37 million, which rose to 38 million in 1866. By the loss of Alsace
and Lorraine, France's territory was reduced in 1871 to 207,000 sq. mi. with little over
36 million inhabitants. In 1876, the population had risen again to almost 37 million.

Since 1792, France has been divided into districts, called \textit{D\'epartements}. Originally, there were 83 \textit{d\'epartements}, numbered in alphabetical order, from Ain to Yonne. During the wars of the Republican and Napoleonic periods, the newly acquired territories also were divided into departements, so that in 1811 there were no less than 134 departements. After 1815, France again was confined to its original boundaries, but due to internal changes the number of departements had increased slightly and in 1849 was 86.

 When the Sardinian provinces of Annecy and Chambery and Nizza were acquired in 1860,
three new departements with the numbers 87, 88, and 89 were formed. In 1871, the
loss of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany affected five departements, namely Bas-Rhin (No.
67), which was lost completely, Haut-Rhin (No. 66), of which a small slice remained as
"Territoire de Belfort" under French sovereignty, Moselle (No. 55) and Meurthe
(No. 52), of which less than half remained, to be combined into a new departement,
Meurthe and Moselle (No. 52), as well as Vosges (No. 82), of which only a small slice
of territory was lost. The numbers of the lost departements were not reassigned; therefore, at the end of the classic stamp period, France was divided into 86 departements,
numbered from 1 to 89 (except the numbers 55, 66 and 67), and the territory of Belfort.

The capital of France was and is Paris which with its suburbs formed a separate
departement Seine (No. 60). The city was founded by the Romans, who had called it
Parisia, and became one of the most important cities of the world. It had a population
of 1,050,000 in 1851, which had risen in 1861, after incorporation of the suburbs,
to 1,700,000 and in 1876 to almost 2 million.

\section{Overseas Possesions}
France had during the classic stamp period a rather large number of overseas possessions.
One of them, Algeria, on the northern coast of Africa, from 1848 was considered an integral part of France. It covered about 80,000 sq. mi. and had a population of about
2,200,000 in 1849, of which only about 110,000 were Europeans. While the total
population increased only slowly - it was 2,500,000 in 1856 and 2,800,000 in 1876 the
European population almost tripled during that period, being 170,000 in 1856 and
320,000 in 1876. Until 1858, Algeria was under military rule, then civilian administration
was gradually established. In 1871, almost completely under civilian administration, Algeria was divided into three departements.

The other French overseas possessions consisted in 1849 mainly of a number
of settlements on the West Coast of Africa, later forming in part the colonies of Senegal
and Ivory Coast, several islands near the east coast of Africa, the most important
being Reunion, French India, consisting of five settlements on the coast of British India, as well as a number of small islands in the Pacific, with [Tahiti](../Tahiti/introduction) as the most important one. On the American continent, only one
possession, French Guiana, remained of a great empire, as well as the islands of
Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Carribean and St. Pierre and Miquelon off the coast
of Newfoundland. 

During the classic stamp period, the possessions on the west coast of
Africa, especially in Guinea, as well as in the Pacific-the latter mainly by the acquisition of New Caledonia-were enlarged, and a few new possessions, the Somali Coast
(Djibuti) on the north-west coast of Africa, and Cochinchina---a part of Indochina---were
added. Altogether, the French possessions were numerous and scattered all over the
world, but compared with the French colonial empire of the 18th century and with the
large and valuable possessions in Africa, which were acquired after the end of the
classic stamp period, were of little importance.

The history of France is a long and colorful one. The earliest inhabitants of the
country had come from the east, among them the Liguri,ans and Iberians, who had
settled in the southern part. As early as 600 B.C. the Greeks had a colony at Massilia,
the present Marseille. About the same time, the Gauls, which belonged to the Celtic
race, invaded the territory from the east and subjugated the former inhabitants. Their
three branches, the Aquitani, Celtae and Belgae, settled in a territory which extended
over the borders of the later France, mainly at the North and East, where it extended
to the Rhine. They were a nomadic race and wandered far, even to Asia and Africa,
Britain and Spain. Northern Italy was long under their rule and in 390 B.C. they occupied
Rome ,and burned it. Eventually, they were driven back by the Romans who then in turn invaded Gaul territory, which they called Gallia. In 50 B.C., Caesar completed
the conquest and established on the territory of the later France, Belgium and
Netherlands the Roman provinces of Aquitania in the North and Gallia in the South,
to be redivided in 26 B.C. into four provinces, Aquitania, Gallia Belgica, Gallia Lugdunensis and Gallia Narbonensis. The decline of the Roman Empire also brought the downfall of the Gauls who in the last centuries of that Empire had played an important part in its history. Teutonic races moved in from the east in the 3rd and 4th century and
after a turbulent period, during which the
hordes of the Visigoths, Burgnndians, YandaIs
and Huns moved on their nomadic
wanderings through the territory, the Franks,
a Germanic tribe from the Lower and Middle
Rhine, gained possession of the whole territory.

It remained for the time being part
of the Western Roman Empire, but in the
5th century, on independent Frankish Kingdom
was established. It contained not only
all of France, but also Belgium, Netherlands,
and extended over a large part of western
Germany and Austria, Switzerland and even
a northern slice of Spain. Under Charlemagne,
who ruled from 768 to 814 and was
crowned "Emperor of the West", the Frankish
Kingdom became one of the most powerful
entities in the world, extending from
the Spanish peninsula to the plains of
Hungary and from Denmark to Southern
Italy. After this empire was divided in 843,
the Western Frankish Kingdom was established,
which had as its eastern boundary the
Rhine and comprised beside France part of
Belgium in the north. In the 9th and 10th
centuries, the power of the kings deteriorated
and independent lords greatly limited
the royal authority. In the 12th century, a
conflict with England, which claimed the
French crown, beg,an and continued for three
centuries. During that time, the British during
some periods controlled almost all of
France and the French king became nearly
powerless. In 1328, the House of Valois came
to power and the authority of the kingdom was gradually restored. But still only half
of France was loyal to the king, while the
other parts were either occupied by the
British or were in the hands of British
vassals. At the middle of the 16th century.
about twenty percent of the country did
not recognize the authority of the king,
which deteriorated again, when shortly later
a series of civil wars started. They led
eventually to the accession of the House of
Bourbon to the throne in 1589. The rule of
the Bourbon kings, although characterized
by many wars, especially against the Habsburgs,
led under Louis XIV to the establishment
of a united kingdom, in about the
present boundaries of the country. 

\section{Louis XIV}
Louis XIV's rule was the culminating point of great luxury and splendor by the ruling
class, which eventually proved to be the seeds of the bloody French Revolution, which
started in 1789 under the rule of Louis XVI.

\section{Napoleonic Period}
The revolutionary period, which had led to the First French Republic, ended in 1799,
when the suceessful General Napoleon Bonaparte was made First Consul in a provisional
three Consul government. In 1800 Napoleon beeame dictator and in 1804 was crowned
"Emperor of all Frenchmen". During the ten years of his rule, Napoleon's military
genius brought France to the greatest might in its history and in 1811 the borders of
France had been extended to the Baltic (including northern Germany and the Hanseatie
cities), Belgium, Netherlands, parts of Northern and Central Italy and the Illyric
Provinces (on the eastern coast of the Adriatic). Aside from that, almost all Europe
was composed either of French vassal states or allies of France, leaving only Great
Britain, Russia and Turkey outside of Napoleon's orbit. 

When Napoleon in 1812 tried to invade Russia, his downfall started, until his final defeat and abdication in 1815. Louis XVIII of Bourbon now was established
king, followed in 1824 by Charles X, who was deposed by a revolution in 1830. Louis
Philippe, Duke of Orleans, became king, but he also was forced to abdicate as a result of the revolution of 1848, when the monarchy was abolished and the Second
French Republic created. But it was of short duration, because a nephew of Napoleon
I, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, was elected president by the National Assembly
and established himself in 1851 as dictator.
