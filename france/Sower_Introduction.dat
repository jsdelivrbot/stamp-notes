\subsubsection{Criticism of the Design}

'The Sower' by L.-O.Roty was a well received design. Following its appearance on 6 May 1903 some criticism was received<sup>1</sup>:

begin{enumerate}

item the shadows cast by the 'Sower' are badly placed in view of the source of the light from the sun. At the time this was explained away by the lighting of the plaster model used by Roty.

item contrary to elementary principles of agriculture, the 'Sower' is sowing against the wind, whose direction is shown by her flowing locks. If she had acted thus in nature, part of the seeds would have blown back in her face.
