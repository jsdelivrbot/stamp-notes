\chapter{The Sower Stamps}    

La Semeuse, the Sower, first appeared on French stamps on 2 April 1903. In fact, the first rough pencil sketch of the Sower was made in 1886 (Fig. 1). In 1895, the design
was used on a large bronze medallion, 265mm in diameter (Fig. 2), intended as an award for
agricultural achievement. In the event, as we shall see, the medallion was withdrawn from
competition. Instead, the Sower design was selected to appear on the new silver coins of France: the 50 centimes piece which was issued in 1897, the one franc and two franc coins which followed in 1898 (Fig. 3), and later values up to five francs.

Originally designed in 1898 by French engraver Louis Oscar Roty, 1846 to 1911. Roty was a prolific sculpture and engraver. His works can be found in most major European museums. His best known work is probably Semeuse, The Sower which has now appeared on various French coins for over a century, having first appeared on an 1898 5 francs essai, and then having transferred to the euro 20 cents.

She is shown wearing a Phrygian cap (Liberty Cap or Bonnet Phrygien), a soft, red, conical cap with the top pulled forward, originally worn in antiquity by the inhabitants of Phrygia, a region of central Anatolia. It was worn by freed Roman slaves, was adopted as a symbol of freedom or revolution during the French Revolution, and is now often used to represent freedom, or the search for liberty. It appear on US and other American coins, sometimes shown on a short pole.}

\section{The Designer}

La Semeuse was designed by Louis-Oscar Roty (Fig. 4). Born in Paris on 11 June 1846, Roty
studied art under the sculptor Augustin Dumont and the engraver Hubert Ponscarme. It was on
account of the latter that Roty, with typical generosity, withdrew from competition the medallion
which he had sculpted for the Ministry of Agriculture. Ponscarme had a large family to support,
and Roty did not wish to compete against his former master and deprive him of the commission.

Roty played a major role in the renaissance of medallic art in the late 19th century. He exhibited at the Salon from 1873, and won the much-coveted Grand Prix de Rome in 1875, enabling him to further his studies in Italy. In 1885 Roty was awarded the Legion d'Honneur. In 1888 he became the youngest member of the Academic des Beaux-Arts de I'lnstitut Francais, and in 1897 its president. He won the Grand Prix in 1889 and again in 1890 at the Exposition Universelle, and was made a Commander of the Legion of Honour. Roty died in Paris on 23 March 1911. Many of his designs and examples of his work are preserved at the Musee Oscar Roty in Jargeau (Loiret). Roty's career as a sculptor of medals and bas-reliefs culminated in the selection of La Semeuse as the motif for the new coins in 1897. All three denominations were minted regularly
in great abundance until 1920, when the silver coinage was replaced by cupro-nickel alloy. So
popular was the design that the Sower was chosen to reappear on the New Franc coins which
were issued in 1960.

\end{figure*}

\section{The Model}

There are various legends concerning the identity of the model who posed for the Sower. The Roty Foundation collection in Jargeau contains a photograph of a young Italian girl, Rosalinda Pesch, aged 16 in 1886, who may have inspired Roty's original sketch. However, it now seems certain that Charlotte Ragot (Fig. 5), aged 30 in 1897, was Roty's model for the medallion and coin versions of the Sower. A well-respected artists' model in Paris, she often worked with Roty and posed for his classical designs.

\section{The Engraver}

Roty's fame as the designer of La Semeuse was matched by that of his great friend Louis-Eugene Mouchon (Figs 6 and 7), the engraver who made the dies for the printing of the Sower stamps.

Mouchon was born in Paris in 1843, and died there in 1914. He first worked in his artisan
father's workshop, where he learned copperplate engraving. Self-taught, studious, a tireless worker, his growing reputation led to his appointment as the official engraver for the postal administration in 1876. The French stamps which Mouchon engraved are well known: the allegorical group representing Peace & Commerce ("Type Sage") of 1876-1900; the two series of "The Rights of Man", which Mouchon also designed, issued in 1900 and 1902; and of course La Semeuse. Mouchon also engraved stamps for the French Colonies, including the first issues from Tunisia, and the stamps depicting Albert I of Monaco. He acquired an international reputation,
receiving commissions from Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Russia, Rumania, Serbia,
Greece, Ethiopia, Guatemala and Argentina. He also engraved French banknotes and postal
orders. His versatility embraced other art forms: he excelled in woodcarving, he engraved
medallions, painted, worked in enamel and ceramics, and wrote poetry.
In 1895, Mouchon received the red ribbon of the Legion of Honour, and in 1900 the Salon
presented him with the Medal of Honour in recognition of his work. An excessively modest man,
Mouchon was not well known to the public at large, but his talents were appreciated by his
professional colleagues and fellow artists. He and Roty regarded each other with great affection and respect.

\section{The Choice of a new Design in 1902}

As mentioned, Mouchon had designed and engraved the series of stamps known as "The Rights
of Man" (SG296-299) which had appeared in 1900. However, the seated figure of a woman
holding a scroll was not pleasing, and despite Mouchon's redrawing of the vignette in 1902
(SG309-313) it was decided to replace the design.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../france/sower-plaster-cast.jpg}
\end{figure*}
A Deputy from the Jura, Georges Trouillot (Fig. 8), Minister of Commerce and Industry in
the government of Emile Combes, urged the new Under-Secretary of State (later Minister) for
Posts and Telegraphs M. Alexandre Berard (Fig. 9) to adopt a figure more in favour with the
public as the symbol of the Third Republic. Encouraged by Trouillot, who was a friend and
admirer of Roty, the Minister chose the design of the Republic sowing ideas, which had adorned
the silver coins since 1897. The Decree of Adoption of the Sower design for use on stamps was
made on 16 October 1902, and the press applauded the Minister's choice.

Roty's Sower, engraved by Mouchon, would be used for the five middle values: the lOc,
15c, 20c, 25c and 30c stamps. Denominations below lOc would continue to be served by Type
Blanc, and Type Merson would be used for the higher values above 30c.

There was a political motive behind Trouillot's choice of La Semeuse. She was intended to
represent the Republic on the march, at the rise of a new dawn. Wearing the Phrygian cap of liberty, lightly draped in classical garb, she symbolised rural France, sowing ideas and delivering a message of peace. The Sower turned her back on her warlike rival Germania, symbol of Imperial Germany, who was clad in iron and carried a sword.


\section{Preparations for the New Issue}

Roty made a plaster cast of the Sower (Fig. 10) which served as the model for Mouchon's
engraving. Mouchon engraved the poingon or die in bronze, without the value (Fig. 11). It
depicts La Semeuse against a lined background, with the sun rising above the horizon behind her.

Mouchon made full use of his artistry as a copperplate engraver, and chose not to employ the plain background normally identified with typography. He delivered the die to the director of the Atelier, the government printing works in Boulevard Brune, where copies of the dies, the cliches, were reproduced in copper to make up the galvanos or printing plates. At this time all stamps were printed on flat plate presses: printing on the faster rotary presses was introduced towards the end of 1922.

The correspondence which passed between Mouchon, the director of the Atelier and the
Minister between November 1902 and February 1903 reveals that there were technical difficulties with the engraving. The original die (which postal historians now call the poingon archai'que), though providing magnificent proofs of the Sower, was engraved too finely to be reproduced satisfactorily, and to his considerable annoyance Mouchon had to re-engrave the die (now called the poingon primitif) for the five values of stamps, to enable the printing plates to be manufactured.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../france/1903-trials.jpg}
\caption{Trials in approved colours, with values omitted, 1903. }
\end{figure*}

Mouchon's fee for this work, agreed with the Minister, was 4,000 francs (Â£8,000 in 2003).
Colour trials were produced for the Minister's approval. The final selection of colours for the five new stamps (with their values omitted) is shown in Fig. 12. The slate-green was chosen for the 15c stamp as it reminded M. Trouillot of the colour of the mountain pines in his Jura constituency. According to the postal historian and stamp dealer Arthur Maury, Roty would have preferred jaune-indien, but was told that this colour, one of the most expensive, would have added an extra 145,000 francs to the annual printing bill: Roty withdrew his request.

Urgent instructions were given to the director of the Atelier to hasten the production of the new stamps. Maury reports that the sheets were printed in the morning, gummed in the afternoon,
and perforated the next day; these three operations would normally have taken a fortnight! By the
end of March, the printers were delivering 1,000 sheets of 300 stamps each day.

\section{The Sower Issues of 1903}

The first of the new lined Sowers, the 15c slate-green (SG316) was issued on 2 April 1903. This
was the internal postal rate for ordinary letters. Keen to impress his fellow politicians, Trouillot
issued instructions that the stamps were to be put on sale first at the post offices of the Senate and
Chamber of Deputies, and at selected post offices in Paris, before being allowed to go on general
release. On the first day of issue, more than 20,000 of the new 15c stamps were sold at the
guichets of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies alone. According to Maury, demand was so
great that the clerks at the post office counters had to ration the sale of the new stamps to five per
customer. A first day cover, postmarked Paris 1, Place de la Bourse, 2-4-03 is shown at Fig. 13.
The other values were issued during the weeks that followed: lOc rose-carmine (SG314) used for
postcards, on 6 May; 20c purple-brown (SG317) used for commercial samples, on 29 June; 25c
blue (SG319) used for letters sent abroad, on 28 April; and 30c pale lilac (SG321) for double rate
postage, on 29 June. These too, were first issued at selected offices in Paris, and only later
elsewhere, as stocks of the earlier type Mouchon were used up.

Between 1904 and 1906 the Sower appeared on postcards, letter cards and other forms of
postal stationery, as well as on bank mandates. Some 15c Sower stamps were overprinted P.M. (standing for Franchise Militaire) from July 1904, for use by members of the armed forces on active service, as were lOc stamps from July 1906.


\section{Public Reaction}

The new design was generally acclaimed as a great success. Press and public alike were pleased
to see the familiar figure of La Semeuse, the elegant embodiment of rural France, appearing on
stamps as well as on coins. Nevertheless, there were complaints, on political, artistic and practical
grounds.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../france/65c.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}

Some nationalists would have preferred to see a more militant figure, a patriot such as
Jeanne d'Arc, who would symbolise France's determination to recover the lost provinces of
Alsace and Lorraine, occupied by Germany since the defeat of 1871.
Purists complained that the lighting of the design was irrational. If the sun, rising behind
the Sower, was the source of light, then it should have illuminated her back, rather than leaving it
in shadow. (In fact there was a simple explanation for this: Mouchon's engraving was made from
Roty's plaster cast which, being in relief, had caused the shadows).

Worse: it was obvious from her windswept hair and from the gusting folds of her dress that
the Sower was sowing into the wind. The seed corn would be blown back into her face. No
paysanne with a soupcon of common sense would be so foolish! Postal officials complained that the figures and lettering were difficult to read against the lined background.

Minister Berard, himself something of a perfectionist, was aware of such criticisms, and
asked Mouchon to make changes. The task of reworking the background for the Sower was to
prove a frustrating and ultimately humiliating exercise for Mouchon during the years 1903-1907.

The Musee de la Poste in Paris holds a series of engraved dies and proofs which show Mouchon's efforts to correct the design faults during this period. Mouchon attempted to retain the lined background. The blue Essais de Fonds of 1906, illustrated at Fig. 14, show the variations in the background design which he proposed for the lOc lined Sower, as well as the solid background proposed for the 25c cameo Sower. Mouchon prepared similar artist's trials in green and in red.

In time, dies become worn, and need to be reworked or replaced. This can result in different types of a stamp, each having its own distinguishing features. Thus the specialised catalogues identify
three types of the lOc lined Sower, and six types of the 15c lined Sower. We cannot always be
certain which dies were modified or replaced by Mouchon himself, and which by the engravers of the Atelier The Sower on Ground 1906
1906 provided a suitable opportunity for the introduction of a new Sower. The government had
been put under considerable pressure to reduce the ordinary internal letter rate from 15c to lOc.
The journal Le Matin led the campaign for this reduction by distributing more than 100,000
picture postcards, addressed to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, which contrasted the
high French postal charges with the lower rates charged elsewhere in Europe. Such a postcard is
shown in Fig. 15. The Minister decided that a new lOc Sower stamp would be issued to coincide
with the reduction in the letter rate, which was to take place on 16 April 1906.
Mouchon engraved a fine new die whose design, La Semeuse avec Soleil Devant, showed
the sun rising in front of the Sower (Fig. 16). This was intended to counter any further criticism
of the aberrant light source. The artist's proofs without value show three different patterns for
the rays of the sun. Short dotted lines of sunlight were selected for the lOc die. To provide an
alternative choice for the Minister, Mouchon also modified an earlier die, and depicted La Semeuse
avec Sol, the Sower in cameo, against a plain background, standing on the ground (Fig. 17). Trial
sheets, containing 50 stamps of each of these designs, were printed, but the results were
unsatisfactory. With the new placement of the sun in front of the Sower, the design appeared flat
and lacking in distinction; it was promptly rejected. With time running out, the Minister reluctantly
chose the alternative.
La Semeuse avec Sol (SG325) was duly issued and sold, first at the post offices of the
Senate and the Chamber of Deputies on 13 April, and more generally on 16 April 1906. Plate 1
was used to print some 2 million stamps in sheets of 50 by flat press between 10 and 25 April: no
Millesime appears on these sheets.
Mouchon made retouches to the die for Plate 2, lightening the shading on the Sower's right
shoulder and on the ground. Plate 2 was used to produce some 28 million stamps, in sheets of
150 which included the Millesime 6. These went on sale on 17 May. Despite the changes, the
Sower on Ground did not satisfy the Minister, or gain popularity with the press or public. The
critics carped at the new Sower "perched on a pedestal" ("juche sur un socle"). The stamps were
withdrawn from sale in July 1906, after only three months.
The Sower with Thin Figures, without Ground, 1906
Mouchon was again asked to revise the design, and he produced a new die in record time. When
Minister Berard saw the first proofs, he commented that the top of the Sower's seedbag looked
like a breast ("un teton"), and demanded its removal. He was informed by the technical director
of the printing works, M. Thevenin, that it would be impossible to scratch out the offending lines
("gratter le teton") without making a new galvano: this would require more work from Mouchon,
and lead to further delay.

Berard relented, and instead authorised Mouchon to engrave the dies for a new series of
definitive stamps, lOc, 15c, 20c, 25c, and 35c, in which the Sower would appear in simple cameo against a solid background, without any ground. Mouchon duly engraved the dies in copper: they are preserved at the Musee de la Poste.

The new lOc red Sower for the ordinary letter rate (SG328) was issued on 28 July, followed
by the 35c violet Sower for registered letters (SG329) on 8 November 1906. Both stamps were printed in sheets of 300, and are described as "Chiffres Maigres" as the figures of value and the lettering of the word pastes are thinly drawn.

Type 1 of the lOc red Sower (Fig. 18) went on sale at midday at the post office in Rue de
Crenelles: within two hours it was withdrawn! Mouchon had engraved the die under the supervision of the Minister for Fine Arts, M. Dujardin-Beaumetz. When samples of the stamps were shown to Minister Berard, he was so annoyed at the heavy print and lack of definition of the design that he ordered the immediate withdrawal of the stamps from sale, the destruction of Plate 1, and the burning of all unsold sheets. Notwithstanding the Minister's order, officials gradually allowed further quantities of the Type 1 sheets to be distributed and sold in post offices, in order to prevent stamp dealers from speculating in the original issue, and making a killing.

Mouchon made retouches to his engraving, by inserting fine white lines of light which
improved the delineation of the Sower's robe and seedbag. The lOc and 35c values of the revised
stamps (known as Type IIA) were issued respectively on 20 October and 8 November 1906, and
continued to be sold until 2 February 1907. However, despite all of Mouchon's efforts, the
Minister was still not satisfied with the new design. In the circumstances, no stamps were issued from the retouched dies of the other three values.

\section{The Sower with Thick Figures, without Ground, 1907}

On 24 October, just four days after the reissue of the lOc stamp, Berard ordered that the Sower
with thin figures be replaced. To Mouchon's mortification, the Minister also insisted that a new
engraver be appointed. Jean-Baptiste Lhomme, a graveur retoucheur from the Atelier, engraved
a new die, which reinforced the figures of value and made the lettering of the word pastes appear
in a bolder type. The stamps, which were produced from the new die, are described as "Chiffres
Grasses" (Fig. 19). Lhomme did not receive an engraver's credit for his work: the names O. Roty
and E. Mouchon continued to appear below the frame-line on Sower stamps.

Printing of the definitive series of cameo Sowers with thick figures commenced in January
1907. The first to be issued was the 5c green Sower (SG331), in the form of booklets of 40
stamps on 6 March and in sheets of 150 stamps on 19 March 1907. The lOc red Sower (SG334)
was issued in September 1907, the distinctive scarlet shade (SG333) appearing in November of
that year. The higher values in the series, the 20c brown, 25c blue, 30c orange and 35c violet,
were issued in different shades and at different times between 1907 and 1913.


The Sowers after 1913
As this article concerns The Early Years, I will be brief and selective. The lOc Sower was
surcharged, then redesigned, for the benefit of the Red Cross in September 1914 (SG352-3, Fig.
20). Some Sower stamps (among others) were printed on greyish-granite GC (for Grande
Consommation) paper as a wartime economy measure during 1916-19.
When the war ended, some metals needed for the minting of coins were in short supply, and
Sower stamps served as small change. Department stores issued this monnaie de necessite by
placing stamps in protective sachets or cardboard covers, and banks and private companies
issued stamps encased in aluminium and cellophane (timbres-jetons), which carried advertisements
for their products and services (Fig. 21).
Cameo Sowers and lined Sowers were issued in profusion during the interwar years, at
various times, and in different formats as sheets, booklets and coils, and postal stationery. They
appeared in an astonishing variety of colours, types and values, and were often overprinted, until
the Vichy government ordered their replacement in 1941.

In 1960, in recognition of her popular appeal, the Sower graced the first coins and stamps
to be denominated in New Francs. The dies for the new 0.20 and 0.30 stamps (SG1455-6) were
engraved by Jules Piel (Fig. 22). Sower stamps and booklets were issued for the 1996 Journee du Timbre. In 2002, France said farewell to the franc, but not to the Sower. She reappeared on the
lOc, 20c and 50c euro coins.

La Semeuse has been a treasure to France, to philatelists and numismatists for more than
a century. Long may she continue to delight us. Here's to the next 100 years!



\subsubsection{Criticism of the Design}

'The Sower' by L.-O.Roty was a well received design. Following its appearance on 6 May 1903 some criticism was received<sup>1</sup>:

\begin{enumerate}

\item the shadows cast by the 'Sower' are badly placed in view of the source of the light from the sun. At the time this was explained away by the lighting of the plaster model used by Roty.

\item contrary to elementary principles of agriculture, the 'Sower' is sowing against the wind, whose direction is shown by her flowing locks. If she had acted thus in nature, part of the seeds would have blown back in her face.

\end{enumerate}
