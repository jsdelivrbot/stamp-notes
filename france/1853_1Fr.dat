The one Frank stamp was issue on 17th August, 1853. It exists in numerous shades the most prominent being: (a) carmine, (b) deep carmine, (c) carmine velours. In 1854 the rates changed and the stamp was withdrawn. Only 963,300 stamps were issued.

Except where stated, this issue was withdrawn on 15th October, 1862.

During the design and development of this issue it appears a two colour stamp was contemplated. An essay exists in blue and violet. The essays can also be found  in pairs 
(Fig.~\ref{essay01} and \ref{essay02}), in rose and violet and violet foncé et violet clair.
