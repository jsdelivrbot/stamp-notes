## French Stamps and Postal History

####1849-50 "Ceres" Issue Introduction
The Ceres series was the first postage stamp series of France, issued in 1849 as a representation of the French Republic.
The series bore the effigy of Ceres, goddess of growing plants in Roman mythology. Jacques-Jean Barre did the initial drawing and gravure. Anatole Hulot was in charge of the printing of the Ceres series done in Paris in the 19th century.

The drawing was used again by necessity when the Second Empire fell in 1870, with printing in Paris besieged by German armies and in Bordeaux where the French government fled. 

The 1849-50 first issue of France has the greatest number of different  \tete varieties, and they
include the premier philatelic items of France. The t&#234;te-b&#234;che is known in all values of this issue except
the 40 centimes, which has two examples of wrong denomination clich&#233;.

Two new Ceres series were issued in the 1930s and 1940s.
As first series of France, these stamps appeared regularly on commemorative stamps for philatelic anniversaries and exhibitions, and on the logo of many philatelic organizations and firms. 

After the coup in December 1851, Prince-President Louis-Napol&#233;on Bonaparte decided to have his effigy on French stamps. The first denominations were issued progressively from September 1852 and throughout the Second Empire.
