## French Stamps and Postal History

####1849-50 1 franc
The famed 1 franc vermillon stamp was issued in January 1849 to pay the domestic triple-weight letter
rate, and was withdrawn from service in December 1849 because its color was too close to the soonto-
be issued orange 40 centimes stamp. Two printing plates were prepared for this denomination, the
first of which contained a single \tete cliche at position 35, and the second of which was normal.
It is believed that only the first of the two printing plates was used to print just 250 thousand of the
vermillon stamps in the first week of 1849, and 122 thousand of those were returned to be destroyed in
December 1849. Consequently, only 850 tÃªte-bÃªche pairs were in circulation, ranking them among the
rarest of French errors. Four major color variations exist for this stamp: rouge-brun, vermillon,
vermillon terne, and vermillon vif. One heavily cancelled rouge-brun tÃªte-bÃªche pair on an August
1849 cover to India is known, while a faulty used strip of three on a fragment is the only known
example of the vermillon \tete variety. A cancelled strip of three of the vermillon terne
etrusque stamp is the only \tete known in that rich shade, and is shown in Figure 8. This strip
