\section{Empire 1853-60}

Exactly a year after the coup d'etat, Louis Napoleon, by a further plebiscite, was elected
Emperor and became Napoleon III. The Empire was revived and the stamps were redesigned.
REPUB-FRANC was replaced by EMPIRE-FRANC, otherwise the design was identical,
with the exception that Barre's initial below the bust was removed.
