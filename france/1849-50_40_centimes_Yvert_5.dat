#### 1849-50 40 centimes.

The orange 40 centimes was the only value of this issue that did not have any \tete cliches,
although two 20 centimes cliches were erroneously inserted at positions 146 and 147 of the second of
the two plates used.

The value tablets of these cliches were re-engraved either on the lead assembly or
the copper galvano, and all of the four retouched 4's are sufficiently different to be quite recognizable.
Starting in February 1850, 4.1 million stamps were delivered, so about 14 thousand copies of each
retouched stamp were printed. Consequently, these errors are quite rare, and extremely so with both
errors in a pair. Figure 6 shows a mint marginal strip of five that includes both errors at the left. This
extraordinary piece passed through the collections of Ferrary, Hind and Rothschild. These errors can
also be found in the 1862 official reprint, for which 14.5 sheets of 300 were printed. This means that
the reprint of the retouched 4's is quite rare, with only fifteen copies of each stamp issued. Figure 7
shows a marginal strip of five reprints with both retouched cliches at the right. Curiously, no \tete
errors re-occur in the 1862 reprints of the other values of the 1849-50 issue, since it appears that
an effort was made to select only error-free plates for the reprint

VERY FINE APPEARANCE. A RARE PAIR OF THE 1850 40-CENTIMES CERES ISSUE, WITH ONE STAMP SHOWING THE RETOUCHED "4". ONE OF THE GREAT RARITIES OF THE ISSUE.

Two different plates of 150 were used to print this issue. On these, Positions 146 and 147 of only one of them were retouched to widen the "4" of "40". The pair offered here, from Positions 145 and 146 and with a cancellation that leaves the retouching clearly visible, should be considered desirable.
