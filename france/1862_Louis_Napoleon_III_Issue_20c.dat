VERY FINE. A RARE COVER SENT FROM CAMP DE CHALONS, WHICH WAS A CITY CREATED EACH YEAR BETWEEN 1850 AND 1870 FOR JUST PART OF THE YEAR IN THE CHAMPAGNE REGION.

According to Wikipedia, Camp Chalons was a military camp created by Napoleon III. The initial purpose was for military exercises, but it quickly turned into a showcase of the French Imperial Army, where French citizens could meet the army and watch parades. Each year the town was transformed into a town of tents and wooden chalets. It was opened August 30, 1857 and was only in operation for part of the year. The recipient of this cover was active in French society and was friendly with princes of the house of Orleans. She also owned Chaalis Abbey north of Paris and transformed it into a castle.
