###Stamps and Postal History



\phl[40%]{../ethiopia/postcard-01.jpg}{}

{{wi:Ethiopia}} has a long philatelic history. In December 1867, British military authorities
opened a main post office at Annesley bay, south of __Massawa__. By the time the Anglo-Ethiopian
War ended, there were military post offices in Adigrat, Antalo, Kumayli, and {{wi:Senafe}}, at British military headquarters, and in every
deployed brigade. These facilities maintained communications betwen Ethiopia, Britain, and India.

Other early post offices included the Egyptian facilities at Massawa (1867-1885) and the
Italian facilities at __Asab__ and Massawa (1883-1889). In 1892, Monseigneur Ludovic Taurin de
Cahagne (1826-1899) established a regular postal service for French residents and other foreign
nationals in Addis Ababa and Harar. He managed the Addis Ababa office while Casimir Mondon-Vidaillet, an advisor
to Menelik II, handled the Harar office and the postal mule-transport
system. Special couriers, called melektengnas, delivered mail in Ethiopia. Such couriers were under the protection
of imperial governors.

In 1892, __Alfred Ilg__, a Swiss engineer who became a chancellor of state under Menelik II,
convinced the emperor to establish a postal system and issue printed stamps. On 9th March
1894, Menelik II issued an edict that authorized the creation of a postal administration and the
construction of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway. A Paris French company, the Atelier de Fabrication des Timbres-Poste,
produced Ethiopia's first stamps in the same year. In 1895, stamps appeared in Addis Ababa and Harar. On 12th May
1899, Ilg started an Ethiopian postal service between Addis Ababa and Harar.

For some years, Menelik II tried to gain membership in the International Postal Union.
France, russia and Switzerland supported Ethiopia's application but Italy persuaded other
members to ignore the request because, in rome's view, ethiopia was a nation of tribesmen led by
a barbarian. Finally on 1 November 1908, Ethiopia succeeded in joining the Universal Postal Union.

The following year,
Ethiopia released a definitive set of postage stamps; additional definitives appeared in 1919, 1928, and 1931. France
printed most of Ethiopia's stamps although Switzerland stepped in during World War I, when France was unable to do the work.

In 1928, Ethiopia inaugarated a new post office in Addis Ababa and increased the variety of its
postage stamps. By 1968 there were 68 post offices in Ethiopia. A mobile post-office 
delivered mail to remote areas such as Assela in Arusi, Dilla in Sidamo, and Nekempte in Wollega.

The Italian-Ethiopian War resulted in the bombing of Addis Ababa's post office and the loss of
most of Ethiopia's philatelic archives. Italian soldiers took most of what was left back to Italy.

During the Italian occupation, Italy issued stamps for __Africa Orientale Italiana__. 
Following Italy's defeat
in 1941, haile Selassie resumed issuing Ethiopian stamps (1942), the first three printed in India. Increasingly
Ethiopian, culture, flora and fauna became the subject of Ethiopian philately.

During the __Derg__ regime, political themes also became popular.
