According to Wikipedia.com, the British 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia was a punitive expedition against the Emperor of Ethiopia Emperor Tewodros II. Tewodros II had written to the British Government requesting their help in his wars with his neighbors. When he received no answer to his letter, he took offence and made a number of British officials and missionaries his prisoners. After the Queen's written appeal of April 1867 went unanswered, a force from the British and Indian armies was despatched under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Napier to free the captives. The force consisted of 13,000 British and Indian soldiers, 26,000 camp followers and over 40,000 animals, including 44 elephants. The force set sail from Bombay and landed at Zula on the Red Sea, and then marched 400 miles south to Tewodros' capital at Magdala. It took Napier's forces 3 months to trek over the mountainous terrain to the foot of the fortress. A battle took place outside this citadel on April 13, 1868, in which the defending forces were routed. Tewodros committed suicide to avoid capture, and the prisoners were released. (Image)
