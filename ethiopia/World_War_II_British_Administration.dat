##Ethiopia
In spring 1941 the Italians were defeated by British and Allied forces (including Ethiopian forces). On May 5, 1941, Emperor Haile Selassie re-entered Addis Ababa and returned to the throne. The Italians, after their final stand at Gondar in November 1941, conducted a guerrilla war in Ethiopia, that lasted until summer 1943. After the surrender of Italy, Ethiopia annexed the former Italian colony of Eritrea.

\ph[60%]{../british-occupation-of-italian-colonies/1375.jpg}{1942, Jan 12. Censored cover to Buxton (Great Britain), bearing Great Britain 1d. (2) and 3d., tied by bilingual Addis Ababa datestamps. Exceedingly scarce mail in the period February-March 1942. S.G. 463, 467. The Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement signed on 31.1.1942 recognized Ethiopia as an independent state. British stamps were no more on sale and the Addis Abeba Ethiopian civilian post office started its activity. Therefore covers of the period February-March 1942 franked with British stamps are extremely scarce.
