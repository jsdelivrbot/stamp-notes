# 1897 First Postage Stamp Issue

The first post-office was opened at
Little Popo on March 1st, 1888, and
soon afterwards an office was established
at Lome. Until 1898, and possibly a
little later, these were the only offices
in the colony the stamps used being the
current ones of Germany, until, the special
surcharged series appeared in 1897.
These surcharged stamps, like those of
the other possessions, have the name
overprinted diagonally upwards from
left to right. The 3pf value may be
found in three fairly well marked shades
but the others do not vary at all.

The stamps are worth more used than unused, with premiums attached to the more rare cancellations from small places or railway agencies.
