## French Oceania
French Oceania was a French colony formed in 1903 from several groups of South Pacific Polynesian islands. The islands included the Marquesas, the Tuamotu Archipelago and Gambier, and the Austral and Bass groupings. The most important group was the Society islands; and above all Tahiti with the Capital Papeete. The population was 51,000 in 1941. (see also [Tahiti](../tahiti/introduction)).

The French Oceania colony stamps began in 1892 with the familiar "Navigation and Commerce" issue. They were imprinted as "&#201;TABLISEMENTS DE L'OCEONIE". French Oceania continued until 1946, when the Polynesians were granted French citizenship.

Then the islands status became an overseas territory, and the name was changed to Polyn&#233;sie Fran&#231;aise .
