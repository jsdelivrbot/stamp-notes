## French Oceania
 
The French Oceania colony stamps began in 1892 with the familiar "Navigation and Commerce" issue. They were imprinted as "ÉSTABLISEMENTS DE L'OCEANIE". French Oceania continued until 1946, 
when the Polynesians were granted French citizenship. 
Then the islands status became an overseas territory, and the name was changed to 
Polynésie Française .
