## French Oceania
 
The French Oceania colony stamps began in 1892 with the familiar "Navigation and Commerce" issue. They were imprinted as "&#201;TABLISEMENTS DE L'OCEONIE". French Oceania continued until 1946, when the Polynesians were granted French citizenship. 
Then the islands status became an overseas territory, and the name was changed to Polyn&#233;sie Fran&#231;aise .
