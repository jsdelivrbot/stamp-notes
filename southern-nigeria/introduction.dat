On December 31st 1899 the charter of the Royal Niger Company was revoked and its territories were divided. The southern half was joined with that of the Niger Coast and became what was then known as Southern Nigeria. [Lagos](../Lagos/introduction) remained outside the Union until february 1906, when all the Southern territories were finally amalgamated. The capital, was then transferred from {{wi:Old Calabar}} to Lagos. 

The Niger Company, having completed its arduous pioneer work, no longer held responsibility for administration though still a trading concern. The final junction of both the Nigerias (January 1st 1914) ended the Southern Province's independence. 

Southern Nigeria during its short existence, issued a 57 stamps. The country is not without interest, as its postal history and cancellations are extensive. A good collection can be built with moderate means and fairly quickly.
