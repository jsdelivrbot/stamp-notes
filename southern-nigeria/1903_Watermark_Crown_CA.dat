# 1903-4 King Edward VII 
## (SG10-19)
Owing to the death of Queen Victoria on January 22nd 1901 a small profile of King Edward VII was naturally substituted.

The design was substantially identical to the one for the Queen victoria issue with the only significant change in the fact that the King's head is displayed on a solid background instead of a lined background and the circle in which it is contained is broken at the top to allow for the introduction of a miniature crown. Furthermore whilst the duty plate for teh 2 1/2d. and 6d. was the same with teh values in white on alined background taht of teh 1/- value has teh figure in colour on an uncoloured background.
