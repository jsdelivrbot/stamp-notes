Benadir  is a coastal region of [Somalia](../somalia/Introduction). It covers most of the Indian Ocean coast of the country, from the Gulf of Aden to the Juba River, containing the capital of Mogadishu. The name comes from Persian bandar, which means port (referring to the northern ports of Barawa and Mogadishu), a fact that reflects the region's importance to Persian and Arab trade during the Middle Ages. Benadir is known for a special breed of goats.
