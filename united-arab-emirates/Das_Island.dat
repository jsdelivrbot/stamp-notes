\chapter{Das Island}
Das Island is an Emirati island in the Persian Gulf. It is part of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates but lies well offshore, about 100 miles (160 km) north-west of the mainland. It covers approximately 0.75 miles (1.21 km) by 1.5 miles (2.4 km), and is almost rectangular in shape.

Das Island is inhabited by oil and gas industry personnel. It exports crude oil and liquefied natural gas by tankers as far as Japan and Europe. Oil production began after prospecting during 1956-1960 by the major Abu Dhabi operating companies. Local exporting companies include ADMA-OPCO (oil), and ADGAS (LNG). Number of personnel on Das Island is between 6,000 (normal) and 12,000 (during major overhauls and shutdowns).

Das Island was formerly a noted breeding site for turtles and seabirds. Despite oil and gas production, turtles still feed safely in the area and Das Island has remained an important landfall for migrant birds. There are few traces of ancient inhabitants on Das Island apart from some pieces of Islamic pottery. The island was also used as a place of refuge during storms by fishermen and pearl divers.
