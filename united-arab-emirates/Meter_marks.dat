\chapter{Meter Marks}
A meter stamp, or meter mark, is the impression made by a postage meter machine that indicates that postage has been paid on a letter or parcel.[1] Meter stamps are widely used by businesses and organisations as they are more efficient than using postage stamps.

The usual components of a meter stamp are:
The country of issue.
The date.
The postal value.
The license number.
The meter manufacturer. (optional)

A slogan relating to the user. (optional)
Meter stamps are not adhesive postage stamps in the normal sense, although they may be printed on adhesive labels before being applied to mail. Meter stamps are normally in red, although a variety of colours are found.

The international use of meter marks was approved by the Universal Postal Union in 1920[2], effective 1 January 1922.[3]
