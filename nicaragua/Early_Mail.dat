\chapter{Early Mail}

A series of articles by H. M. Ahrens and N. Thornton in Stanley Gibbons' Monthly
Journal, took up the work where Leavey left off, and covered the further issues from
1908-11 in a very capable manner. As for the rest, there is nothing worthy of mention,
only odd fragments here and there.

In these days, it is expected of a specialist that he should know something of the preadhesive
period of the country that he studies. Of the Central American republics this is a
very difficult matter, as so little material has come to hand.
In the days of the Spanish Colonial Empire, the postal arrangements of Nicaragua came
under the Kingdom of Guatemala, and it is my considered opinion that such pieces that
have survived come mainly from official archives.

Fortunately I am in a position to be able to show you a few representative pieces. The
earliest, circa 1808, is from Granada to Leon, with handstruck 'Granada' in an ornamental
frame, in black. This is followed by letters from Leon to Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and
Masaya, Nicaragua, dated 1822 and 1814 respectively, each showing a boxed LEON,
handstruck in blue. A further letter of 1849 shows a handstruck LEON in fleurons, in black.

In the years immediately after the break-away from Spain, things were chaotic and the
posts no exception. Such letters as I have, immediately prior to the introduction of
adhesives, show no Nicaraguan markings and their origin can only be determined from the
contents. I am showing you two of these, both bearing American 'ship' markings and
addressed to San Francisco.

Nicaragua first became prominent in postal matters about 1849, when Henry L. Goodwin,
who ran the Penny Post Company of San Francisco, had the idea of improving the time
made by the United States mails from the Pacific to the Atlantic, by the establishment of
a service from San Francisco to New York via Nicaragua. The overland route was from
San Juan del Sur on the Pacific coast, by carrier over a macadamized road to La Virgen,
on Lake Nicaragua, and from thence by boat down the San Juan River to Greytown, or
San Juan del Norte, on the Atlantic coast. Mail carried by this service was handstamped
'Via Nicaragua ahead of the mails' in two lines.
