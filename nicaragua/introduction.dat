\chapter{Nicaragua} 


TO Nicaragua belongs the distinction of being the first of the Central American group of
republics to issue adhesive postage stamps. On 9th September, 1862, a decree was promulgated, authorising the preparation and issue of postage labels of 2 and 5 centavos.

The contract to supply these stamps was given to the American Bank Note Company
of New York and on the 2nd December, 1862, they were issued for postal use, but were on
sale only in the cities of Greytown, Grenada and Leon, and were solely available for domestic postage.

These stamps were beautifully engraved and produced, being printed on a stout, hard,
yellowish-toned paper, in sheets of 100, ten rows of ten stamps each and perforated 12.
As no obliterators had been supplied, they are usually found cancelled with pen and ink
or with crayon.

Although catalogues give the date of the issue of the 10 and 25 centavos stamps as September, 1869, it is my considered opinion that they were actually issued at an earlier date, but as proper cancelling stamps were not introduced until 1869, and early covers or letter sheets seem to be non-existent, it is impossible to prove this. I support this contention with the fact that, contrary to catalogue listing, and prior to the introduction of the soft, porous paper, printings on two different papers had already been made. 
These are on a stout,
white paper, which usually gives rough, irregular perforations and on a thin, hard, white
paper (the one mentioned in the catalogues) on which the perforations are clear cut.

Stamps of the first paper are very seldom found used, and when they do turn up, usually
have pen or crayon cancellations, which would seem to indicate that they preceded the
arrival of the handstamps. The stamps on the thin, hard, white paper made their debut in
September, 1869 and consisted of the 2, 5, 10 and 25 centavos values. The 1 centavo value
of this series did not put in an appearance until 1871. To further complicate the issue, I
have all values on the stout, white paper, giving irregular perforations.

About 1873, the American Bank Note Company began printing these stamps on a soft
porous paper, similar to that used later for United States stamps, all values ultimately
undergoing the change. The general effect was to give a brighter appearance.
In December, 1887, the 5 centavos stamp was issued rouletted 8Â£ instead of perforated
and in April, 1878, the 1 centavo value also appeared rouletted, but now also on this soft
porous paper. In November, 1879, the 25 centavos was issued rouletted, but now on a thin,
hard, white paper almost identical with the first thin, white paper used, but it was not until
July 1880, that the 10 centavos appeared with the new form of separation. Some time in
1879 or 1880 supplies of the 1 centavo and 5 centavos were printed on this paper and
rouletted.

\section{Reprints}

In 1892, the Nicaraguan Government officially ordered a reprint of 100,000 sets each of
the perforated and rouletted stamps and sold these reprints to a syndicate of speculators.
These reprints are on a thick closely woven, white paper, the colours being brighter and
harder than those of the originals. The gum is thick, smooth and yellowish, whereas on the
originals it is usually thin and white.

Nicaragua became a member of the Universal Postal Union in 1882 and a new series of
stamps was issued to mark the event. They were printed on soft porous white paper by the
American Bank Note Company, New York, in sheets of 200 stamps (10 x 20). Perforated 12.

\section{Postmarks}

At this period only thirteen post offices were supplied with postmarks and were as follows:

1/S. ' San Juan del Sur. 

2/R. Rivas.

3/G. Granada. 

4/J. Jinotepe. 

5/M. Masaya. 

6/M. Managua. 

7/L. Leon. (Four types).

8/CH. Chinandega.

9/C. Corinto.

10/O Ocotal.

11/M Matagalpa.
 
12/J. Jinotega.

13/N. San Juan del Norte.

The postmarks relative to these offices were not received in Nicaragua until after 1869,
the numeral and letter being in the form of a 'killer' type of obliterator and used for cancelling the stamps. They are usually struck in black, but may also be found in blue or violet.

\end{figure}

A large circular postmark, consisting of a double circle, between which, at the top appeared 'Correos de Nicaragua' and at the bottom the name of the office, with the date in the centre of the inner circle, was applied to the letter sheet or envelope, usually in blue. During this period many dumb cancellations, such as stars, concentric circles, designs and manuscript markings were used, probably on mail handled at places which had the status of suboffices to the thirteen post-offices already mentioned.

\section{The Second, or 'Seebeck' Period}

To properly understand some of these early postal situations, it must be realised that these Central American states, in the period following their emancipation from Spanish rule, were in an extremely impoverished condition and consequently had little to spend on the development of a postal system.

So, when in 1899, a certain Mr Nicholas F. Seebeck, secretary of the Hamilton Bank
Note Company, New York, came to Central America with very attractive terms for the
supply of postage stamps to governments interested, he was casting his seed on very fertile
ground.

A contract was made between the Nicaraguan Government and the Hamilton Bank
Note Company, which was signed and became effective on the 7th May, 1889, for the supply
of postal issues for a period of ten years.

The main terms of this agreement were as follows:

1. The stamps supplied were to be of the highest quality engraving and of artistic
design and the design was to be changed every one or two years.

2. The initial supply was to consist of 2,000,000 adhesives of all denominations, and
was to reach Nicaragua not later than November of each year. A second printing
of another million was to be made at a later date if required.

3. Following a change of design, all remaining postage and official stamps unsold
at the end of the year, were to be returned to the contractor not later than the end
of February. The contractor had the right to retain the plates (originals) and make
additional printings of any or all stamps, for sale to stamp collectors.

4. The Government was not allowed to sell any of these stamps for less than 10 per
cent below face value.

5. The colours of the postage stamps were to be different from those of the telegraphs
and the remainders of the latter need not be returned, but were to be destroyed.

The first of the 'Seebeck' issues appeared in 1890 and the last of them in 1899. In all,
ten issues were supplied, covering postal, official postage-due and telegraph requirement,
and the designs were changed annually, except in 1896 and 1897, when the same design
was used, but the date in the inscription altered. Nicaragua was one of the few countries
that faithfully completed the contract and selected a yearly change in design for her stamp issues.

\section{Reprints}

Although the terms of the contract gave the Hamilton Bank Note Company a free hand,
Seebeck did not proceed to run offlarge supplies of reprints. At first, the unsold remainders,
received from Nicaragua were more than enough to cover all philatelic requirements and no
philatelic reprints appear to have been made of the 1890, 1891, 1893 and 1895 issues.
The issue of 1894 sets a problem, as two distinct printings exist, one on a yellowish paper,
in soft tones, which appears to have done postal duty in Nicaragua and is scarce in mint
condition; also one on a thinner white paper, in clearer brighter colours, which is very
common mint, but of which I have never seen a genuine cancelled copy. It is possible that
these stamps were a reserve printing that was made when stocks in the country appeared to
be running out. When the original supply proved adequate, it was not despatched and
became part of Seebeck's stock when the issue for 1895 came into use, as they are frequently
found bearing the imitation postmarks that were applied to so many of the reprints.
In this event they must be classed as originals, prepared for use but not issued.
With the later 'Seebeck' issues of 1896, 1897 and 1898 it is an entirely different story. As
postal business in Nicaragua was expanding, the consumption of stamps increased and few
remainders were returned to the contractors, also no stock of the 'original' issue had been retained in New York.

Therefore, when philatelic orders came in there were no originals available to fill them,
so reprints were made from the original plates from time to time as required. At least six
reprintings were made, the main differences from the original printing being in the colours, paper and gum. There are no known forgeries of the 'Seebeck' issues.

\section{Third or Surcharge Period}

When the 'Seebeck' contract expired in 1899, Nicaragua was still in a state of financial
embarrassment, so a contract was entered into with a Dr Maximo Asenjo, on llth May,
1899, for the furnishing of all stamps and postal supplies for a continuous period of ten
years, 'free of charge' to the government.

This contract became effective on 1st January, 1900 and provided for an artistic new
engraved design each year, in colours not previously used, the 3, 6 and 25 centavos postage
stamps to be in the colours agreed upon by the Universal Postal Union. The quantities of
the regular yearly issues were to be not less than 3,400,000 pieces, covering all classes of stamps and postal stationery.

When delivery was made, 50,000 complete sets were to be allotted to the contractor,
together with any remaining balance of the previous year's issue. All these stamps were to
be cancelled by favour and were to be the contractor's only compensation. The contract
was transferable.

Asenjo quickly transferred his contract to an unknown speculator, who placed an order
with the American Bank Note Company, New York for the first year's supply (1900).

Delivery was made, but the Nicaraguan authorities never gave the contractor the agreed
50,000 cancelled sets, thus terminating the contract automatically. The stamps supplied
bore the well known design showing Mount Momotombo (in eruption) with a railroad in
the foreground. This stamp is supposed to have been used by an American senator to
influence the decision to cut the interoceanic canal in Panama, in preference to Nicaragua,
on account of the possibility of earthquakes in a volcanic zone.

The collapse of this arrangement compelled Nicaragua to obtain all her own stamps and
postal supplies, which proved to be a matter of some difficulty owing to a lack of finance
in the Postal Department at this time. As a result, the republic was forced to resort to surcharging,
the unnecessary high values of the 'Asenjo' issue being utilised for this purpose in
1901. The equivalent Postage-due series was also converted to postal use by overprinting it
'Correos 1901' and later '1901 Correos' in a smaller type. In 1902, the 2 centavos value was
surcharged '15 cvos.' in black and the 1 centavo value '30 cvos.'

In 1902, a makeshift supply of 5 and 10 centavos stamps was prepared by H. Braunlich,
a small printer of 88 Fulton Street, New York, on the instructions of a Mr Nordenholt,
acting as agent for the Nicaraguan Government. These were crude copies of the design
of the issue of 1900, produced by lithography.

In 1903, a commemorative issue of four values, bearing the portrait of President Santos
Zelaya, engraved and printed by the American Bank Note Company of New York, was
provided by Nordenholt. In 1904 a reissue of these supplemented by four additional values
was made. In the same year, the lithographed stamps of 1902 came in for a heavy bout of
surcharging and one or two issues, made specially to fill dealers orders' were authorised
by the Government, who, because the stamps ordered were sold out, hated to lose good
money, of which they were woefully short at this time.

A completely new issue was supplied by the American Bank Note Co. in 1905, but it was
not long before these were in the hands of the printers for creating the provisional of the 1906-1908 group. In 1907, a series of seven values of the same design were supplied by
Waterlow & Sons Ltd., London, but as this firm were unethical enough to demand payment
before delivery of the stamps, this was to be the last new definitive issue until 1909, as the Treasury was by this time entirely out of funds.

The 1906-1908 group of surcharges produced some very scarce items amongst which are
the lOc. on 4c. orange-red (S.G.310/311), the SI on 5p. violet (S.G.318/319), the lOc. on 5p.
violet (S.G.345), all on American Bank Note Company printings and the 15c. on Ic. green
(S.G.359/360) and lOc. on 20c. lake (S.G.370a/370b) on the Waterlow printings in the same
design.

The next group of provisionals was produced by the utilisation of fiscal stamps printed by
Waterlow Brothers & Layton, London, also over the period 1908-1909. It contained many
errors in the type settings, but the principal rarities are to be found in the group covered by S.G.399/402a, from which the display given contains some pieces, possibly unique.

The year 1909 saw a reissue of the American Bank Note Company stamps of 1905 in
new colours, but these had a very short life in their original state, for as early as 1910
some values were already being surcharged. These gave some spectacular errors, such as
surcharge double, one inverted, and surcharge treble, two inverted, but perhaps the rarest
item of this group is the 5c. on 20c. olive-brown (S.G.437), of which the display contains
several copies, including a used strip of three.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../nicaragua/pair.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{marginfigure}
In 1911, the residue of the Waterlow fiscals was pressed into service with a three or four
line surcharge and dealt with in half sheets of twenty-five stamps at a time. Numerous and
interesting errors abound. In this year came also the ultimate in Nicaraguan surcharges,
the Railway Provisionals or the 'back to front' stamps. By this time the Nicaraguan treasury
was more or less completely without funds and owing to unpaid bills, the post-office could
get no more stamps printed abroad. The only thing to hand was a large stock of railway
tax stamps that had already been surcharged on the face for fiscal use. After some attempts
at conversion into postage stamps by the addition of yet another surcharge, the struggle
was abandoned, the postal surcharge then being printed on the back of the stamps, so that
they had to be stuck face downwards on the envelope when used.

It is completely mistaken to suppose that there is anything philatelic about this issue,
there is not, for they were freely used at the time on commercial correspondence and on
account of the extemporisation in their production some rare and curious errors came
into being. They were printed in small sheets of twenty stamps (4 x 5) and some of the trial
printings of the surcharge on the face of the stamps in unsatisfactory colours were even
pressed into service. Stamps surcharged both sides, inverted and double surcharges are not
uncommon and can be found postally used. Included in the display are some of the scarcest
items from this group, complete settings of S.G.479/480, both normal and inverted, stamps
printed on the face in black, red or yellow, surcharges on both sides and representative
commercial covers.

As this final effort completely exhausted all available stocks of stamps, postal or otherwise,
in January, 1912, a completely new engraved issue of postage stamps was obtained
from Waterlow & Sons, Limited, London covering values from 1 centavo to 5 pesos, also
an independent series for use in the silver peso currency department of Zelaya.

\section{Fourth or Cordoba Period}

This demarcation in the postal issues of Nicaragua arises from a stabilisation of the currency
on a gold basis, the new unit of currency being called the 'peso de Cordoba' - equivalent
in value to one United States gold dollar - and divided into 100 centavos de Cordoba. As the last definitive issue was expressed in terms of the old paper peso, it was decided to surcharge the remaining stocks in terms of the new money. This was done by making use of two types of surcharge, one in five horizontal lines and the other in four horizontal lines, which were applied to the remaining stocks of the 1912 issues both the 'Liberty' design and the 'Locomotive' issue for Zelaya.


\ph[99%]{../nicaragua/cover-1913.jpg}{

}


These provisionals were surcharged in sheets of 100 stamps, and as the fount of type at
the disposal of the printers seems to have been unable to cope with such a large setting,
type from a different fount was used to make up any deficiencies. Various errors of spelling
occur as 'do' for 'de' and 'valb' for 'vale', also an error of date '9131' for '1913' occurs
on one stamp in the setting used for the surcharge of the 2c. on 35c. (Volcanoes) and the
2c. on 25c. (Locomotive). In December 1913, the balance of the 15 cts. provisional on the
35c. was used up in creating further 1/2c. and 1c. de Cordoba stamps by surcharging, the 15c. being deleted with a heavy bar.

}

In January, 1914, five 2c. provisionals with a five line surcharge similar to that of the
1913 printings, but wider spaced (S.G.78) appeared on small numbers of the 4, 20, 25, 35
and 50c. values of the 'Liberty' type, and in February of the same year the same surcharge
appeared on larger numbers of the Ic. (Locomotive) stamp. Stamps from this printing
appear to be very scarce in mint condition, and one can only assume that as they were so
similar to the earlier provisionals, they were overlooked by the new issue dealers.
Between February-May 1914, a further batch of 1, 2, and 5c. provisionals appeared,
surcharged in two lines on the 25, 35, 50 centavos and 1, 2, and 5 peso values of the 'Liberty'
official stamps, the word 'OFICIAL' being cancelled by a heavy bar. The normal colour
for this surcharge was black, but one or two values are known in red, probably from trial
printings that got sent out with the normal post office supplies. The display given contains a
copy of the 5c. on 5p. blue (red surcharge) used on a commercial letter to Manchester.
The first definitive issue in the new 'Cordoba' currency appeared in 1914 (13th May),
with the issue of the 1/2 centavo value, but the series was not completed until the following May when the 20 centavos completed the set. These stamps were engraved and printed by the American Bank Note Company, New York, in sheets of 100 (10 x 10), and showed two different designs, the Presidential Palace in Managua and the Cathedral at Leon. Subject to numerous colour changes they have more or less remained the definitive Nicaraguan issue up to 1937.

These 'definitives' did not remain unassailed for very long, as in September 1915, substantial
quantities of the 6 centavos value was surcharged into a 5 centavo provisional,
and during the period 1918-1920 a whole series of surcharges made on various values of this
issue, now redundant owing to changes in the postal rates, supplied the necessary postage
stamps.

The scarcest provisionals of this period are the so-called 'Bluefields' provisionals. From
March to July 1919, a shortage of 2 and 5 centavos postal values existed in Bluefields
(Department of Zelaya), the postal services being maintained by the use of bisects, telegraph stamps and fiscals. In July, the shortage became acute, as no further supplies had
been received from Managua and the postmaster in Bluefields had the small quantity of
20 centavo slate-grey of the definitive issue still remaining in his stock, surcharged for use as 2 and 5 centavo in black. The surcharging was done from a setting of fifty subjects
which contained forty-three positions reading 'Centavos' and seven positions reading
'Cents'. In the setting for the 5 centavos value there were no less than seven different types of the figure 5.

The 2 centavos is by far the scarcer of these two provisionals, no complete settings ever
having been recorded or any multiple pieces known, but eight different types of the figure
2 are recorded in the 'Scott' catalogue. In the display given, many of the types of both values are shown used, also some mint pairs of the 5 centavos value showing some of the figure varieties se-tenant.

The first 'Bluefields' provisional was soon exhausted and was followed by a second
small printing of the same values, but this time the surcharge took a different form. The
setting was in three lines reading 'VALE - por 2 centavos' - 'de Cordoba', the colour of
that for the 2c. value being blue and that for the 5c. value a mixture of black and red.
The period of currency of the second 'Bluefields' provisionals seems to be from September
to October 1919 and the order of scarcity now appears to be reversed, the 2 centavos in
this case being the more plentiful and the 5 centavos value extremely rare.

\section{Fifth Period}

This period may be said to commence in 1921, since in May of that year the building rented
for the General Post Office in Managua was totally destroyed by fire and the then existing
stock of stamps, postal property and valuable records were consumed. This disaster reflects itself in the subsequent postal issues, through surcharges and the introduction of the 'R.de C.' stamps. 'R.de C.' stood for 'Reconstruction de Comunicaciones' and these stamps indicated the payment of a compulsory tax levied on every letter and package, the proceeds of which provided funds for the rebuilding of the post-office. These 'R.de C.' stamps were of the value of 1 centavo, which was the flat rate per item of mail subject to this tax. 

As can be readily understood this tax called for the continual use of large quantities of stamps and during the period up to 1928, sundry provisional issues of these were needed from time to time.

Apart from these compulsory tax stamps, a series of seven stamps was issued in 1921 to
commemorate the Centenary of the Political Independence of the republic. They were
printed in two colours by the American Bank Note Company, New York, the portraits
being in black, and are quite scarce in used condition, it being believed that they were only placed on sale for one day, probably 15th September, 1921.

In 1922 a reissue in new colours was made of the definitive series of 1914-1915 and printed by the American Bank Note Company from the original plates, with the addition of one new value, the 1 Cordoba deep-brown. One or two minor provisional issues occurred
during the period 1922-1923 including some locally produced 'R.de C.' stamps and some
provisionals for the same purpose, created by surcharging remainders of the Centenary
Issue of 1921.

In 1927-1928, existing stocks of the reissue of 1922 were overprinted 'Resello' or 'Correos' with the appropriate year date added as a method of control. The 'Resello 1927' overprints occur in black, red, blue and a violet colour that is very fugitive when subjected to moisture, and used stamps bearing this violet overprint are completely spoiled unless floated off paper very carefully. A large number of errors occur in these issues, some very scarce and many of these are included in the display.

In the period 1928-34 a further reissue, printed by the American Bank Note Company
in changed colours, was made from the 1914-15 plates, consisting of thirteen values.

\section{Sixth Period}

This may be said to commence in 1929 with the introduction of the first air-mail stamps.
These were produced by overprinting three different issues of the 25c. National Palace
design with 'Correo Aereo-1929-P.A.A.' in three lines, for use on the service introduced by
Pan-American Airways between the United States and Central America. The 25c. blackbrown
was the first of the trio to be overprinted, being issued on 12th May, 1929, and was
first used on 15th May for mail carried from Managua to New York, via Miami, Florida.
The 25c. orange and 25c. violet bearing the same overprint, were issued on 17th July, 1929
and 1st September, 1929 respectively.

During this year some further low value postal provisionals and a 'R. de C.' stamp were
provided by surcharging telegraph stamps and following these a further reissue, in new
colours, was made of some of the values of the 1914-1915 definitive issue.

On 15th December, 1929 the first definitive air-mail stamps were issued. The series consisted of three values 25c., 50c. and 1 Cordoba, the stamps being recess printed by the
American Bank Note Company, the design showing two aeroplanes flying over Mt. Momotombo.

On the 15th September, 1930, a series of eleven stamps was issued to celebrate
the opening of the new General Post Office in Managua. These depicted the new building,
which unfortunately was destined to an all too short life, for it was totally destroyed, together with a large portion of the city, by an earthquake on 3rd March, 1931. In the disaster the bulk of the country's supply of postage stamps and other postal matter was lost.

For a short time afterwards Pan American Airways carried mail free, using their own office
handstamps and on 3rd June the President of Nicaragua authorised the surcharging in
green, for immediate use, the remaining air stamps that had survived. As the quantities
were very small they were sold out in a few hours.

On the 21st June, 1931, a second Earthquake Provisional issue of air stamps was made by
surcharging the remaining small stock of definitive airmail stamps of the 1929 issue in blue.

This was only a temporary expedient, for these were soon exhausted and it was not until
8th July, 1931 that the new supply of 15c. and 20c. definitive airmail stamps were placed on sale. To meet the requirements of ordinary mail certain remaining stocks of 1914-15 type stamps were overprinted '1931' and placed on sale.

\section{Seventh Period}

This seventh and last period commences with the locally produced series, both air and
ordinary postage, which came into being immediately after the earthquake and includes the
very interesting series of validation overprints that were applied to various issues of stamps in the years 1935-36 and includes the following postal issues up to date.

The locally printed issues were produced by Talleres Graficos de Angel Maria Perez,
Managua, in small sheets of ten stamps (2 x 5) on a soft rather open mesh paper. They were
issued without gum and show considerable variations in colour. The first issues, ordinary
postage and airmail were placed on sale 1st January, 1932, for one day only, the proceeds
being devoted to the reconstruction of the Post Office building, destroyed by the earthquake.

Commercial covers bearing these issues are virtually unknown, whilst even first-day
philatelic mail is rare, but the display shows the majority of these stamps postally used,
including a few on cover.

On 24th October, 1932, further airmail stamps were created by overprinting postage
values of 1st January 'Correo Aereo Interior - 1932' in two lines in red. All the makeshift issues of this period produced numerous errors and varieties such as imperf-between pairs, inverted surcharges and overprints, which owing to the small size of the sheets, exist in very limited numbers.

On 17th December, 1932, a series of very large stamps, commemorating the inauguration
of the Rivas railway connecting San Jorge with San Juan del Sur, were supplied by the
same printers, this time in sheets of only four stamps. These were perforated 12 and without gum, and printed on a thick soft paper. On 30th December of the same year a further set was issued to commemorate the opening of the railway connection between Leon and El Sauce, slightly smaller in format, but also in small sheets of four. As only 1,000 sets, both postage and airmail, was printed of these two commemorative issues, they are very difficult to obtain, particularly in used state. I have included two covers bearing stamps of the Rivas Railway commemoratives in the display. Unauthorised reprints of these two issues are known on a thin hard paper, and collectors should use every care when purchasing them.


In 1935, a large quantity of postal issues was stolen by underpaid or dissatisfied postal
officials and to invalidate these the Postmaster General ordered postmasters to initial in
manuscript or by means of a facsimile handstamp all stamps, before selling them to the
public. This was only a temporary measure, as soon afterwards the stocks of stamps
remaining in the post-offices were overprinted with an engraved box-like device containing
'RESELLO 193 5'in either blue or red. The blue overprints appeared first on 5th December,
1935 on both postage and air issues, the red control overprints following later on
2nd November, 1936. For reasons best known to themselves, Stanley Gibbons do not list
these overprinted stamps in their catalogue, merely dismissing them with a foot note.
Since stamps without this control or the manuscript initials of the postmaster were invalid, it is of major importance in the postal issues of the country. The stamps thus treated were widely used for a considerable period and are much commoner in commercially used condition than in the mint state. Some of the blue overprints are of considerable scarcity.

On 1st January, 1937, a new definitive issue in the design of the 1914-15 issue, but in
changed colours, plus air-stamps of 'Momotombo' type, also in new colours, was placed on
sale. This marked the end of any further outbreak of surcharging on a large scale and from
this time, stamp issues have been more or less normal, except for frequent issues of commemorative issues, supplied by most of the world's well known security printers, with
designs of widely different character.

Of these, some of the more interesting are the following. On the 4th April, 1941, three air stamps were issues to commemorate the Centenary of the First Adhesive Postage Stamp.
They show a reproduction of the first Nicaraguan stamp alongside a portrait of Rowland
Hill and were engraved and printed by the Security Bank Note Company, Philadelphia.
On 15th June, 1946 a series of postage and air stamps was issued in honour of Franklin
D. Roosevelt, on one of which he is shown working on his stamp collection, whilst others
depict notable episodes from his life. These stamps were engraved and printed by the Wright Bank Note Company, Philadelphia.

On 23rd November, 1950, postage and air-mail series were issued in commemoration of
the 75th Anniversary of the Universal Postal Union, including a special printing in miniature sheets of four stamps, with special inscriptions in the margins. These stamps were engraved and printed by De La Rue & Company, Limited, London.

On 29th September, 1956, the Nicaraguan President G. A. Somoza was assassinated and
in 1957 a series of five airmail stamps was issued as a token of national mourning. These
stamps were printed in photogravure by the Staatsdruckeri, Vienna. Various other commemorative issues followed, for the Centenary of the Birth of Lord Baden-Powell, Nicaraguan
Merchant Marine (15th October, 1957), Nicaraguan Christian Schools Commemoration
(August 1958), Inauguration of U.N.E.S.C.O. Headquarters Building, Paris,
(15th December, 1958) and the issue in honour of Cardinal Spellman, (26 November, 1959).
On 20th January, 1960 a set of postage and airmail stamps was issued to commemorate
the 150th Anniversary of the Birth of Abraham Lincoln. These were recess printed by De
La Rue & Company, London. On the 19th September of the same year, this set was overprinted
with 'Resello' and a small cross to provide funds for the relief of the victims of the
Chilean earthquake.

It is interesting to reflect on the subjects that provide reasons for the issue of special
stamps by governments, for in 1960 Nicaragua without any particular reason, suddenly
overprinted three miscellaneous airmail stamps in honour of the 10th Anniversary of the
San Jose (Costa Rica) Philatelic Society. It would have been more understandable if it had
been for a domestic body, maybe it was intended as a neighbourly gesture, who knows ?
The final item that brings this 100 years review of Nicaraguan postal issues to a close is
the Centenary stamp that was issued on 9th September, 1962 to commemorate the occasion.
I deliberately call it a stamp, not a miniature sheet, for it shows excellent reproductions of the first 2 and 5 centavos stamps, surrounded by replicas of the postmarks of the thirteen offices supplied with the numeral cancellers, and its value is indicated in the top right hand corner as Cordobas 7.00. As reproduced stamps show the original centavo values, I presume it is intended that it should be used as a complete unit.

I sincerely hope that I have been able to give you a really comprehensive survey in the
625 sheets I was able to place on exhibition, but the selection was a very difficult one and even with this quantity of material I was forced to leave out of the picture the postage-dues, officials and the departmentals for Cabo and Zelaya. This, I feel sure, gives an adequate picture of the immense field that the serious study of the postal issues of Nicaragua presents.
