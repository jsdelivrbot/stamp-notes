A British Consular Post Office was established at Greytown, on the Atlantic coast as
early as 1855. At this time, owing to the lawless state of that part of the country, rather than risk having any cash or stamps at the post office stolen, letters were carried without charge. This office existed until 1882, when
Nicaragua joined the Universal Postal Union. The letter rate to England was one shilling
per half-ounce. Surviving covers are rare (Figures~\ref{nic01} and \ref{nic02}).
