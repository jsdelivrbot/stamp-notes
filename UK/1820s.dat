##Britain
Among the handstamps of the London Foreign Branch, there is a rectangular one bearing the word "Holland" in italic capitals. This was firrst mentioned in Jay and later two copies were found. The earlier
one is illustrated below.

2088  	 	THE VERY RARE BOXED LONDON FOREIGN BRANCH "HOLLAND" MARK IN RED ON COVER FROM HOLLAND TO THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE; July/Dec. 1823 E from "BRIELLE" (fine namestamp nicely placed on the front) addressed (in Dutch) to "Stellenbosch, Caap de Goede Hoop" charged "4" with a mostly very fine (and extremely rare) red boxed fancy "HOLLAND" mark (Jay L1084) also nicely placed on the front. This "HOLLAND" mark was first discovered - this actual example - in 1982 and remained the sole recorded example for 20 years (though the 1838 Proof Strike - illustrated in Jay's London catalogue - has been known for some years); a second example (oddly dated as late as 1842) has now been recorded. It may have been reserved solely for mail sent prepaid from Holland to the Cape via London, hence its great rarity. Important Exhibition Item.    	£1500

The second example oddly is dated as late as 1842. It appears that this mark was reserved solely
for mail sent prepaid from Holland to the Cape of Good Hope.

The handstamp on the earlier cover, belonging to the postal history collection of Harper was in red and was sold by Cavendish in 2009.

Jay illustrated this handstamp in his London book based on a proof from the Post Office Archives. I will be interested to find out if anyone has any more copies of these handstamps. There are no marks of the Cape at the back.
