2152  	 	AUSTRALIA (VICTORIA) - 'RETURNED/FOR/POSTAGE' ON 11d-RATE UNDERPAID COVER EX WALES; 11 Feb. 1858 Fine E to 'Melbourne' endorsed 'Via Marseilles' but franked (initially) by only a single 1d Red 'stars' tied by a very fine '164' Cardigan numeral and so having a very fine red London Foreign Branch 'RETURNED/FOR [5d]/POSTAGE' mark (the 1/4oz rate was 6d via France); then returned and re-posted (when it was realised that it weighed above the quarter ounce and so needed 11d postage rather than 6d) with additional 1d Red 'stars' + 4d Rose-carmine + 6d Lilac all tied by v. fine '164' numerals (and so overpaid 1d, because oddly the French rate was only an extra 5d for above 1/4 & up to 1/2oz). Redirected within Melbourne on arrival. Attractive and unusual item sent just after the rules on underpaid overseas mail had changed.    	£200
