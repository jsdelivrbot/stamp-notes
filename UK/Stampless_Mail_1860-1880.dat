2127  	 	SCOTLAND/CHILE - RARE GLASGOW 'POSTAGE/NOT/PAID' & BOXED 'RETURNED FOR/POSTAGE' ON CHILE COVER; Fine 31 Oct. 1860 unpaid EL from 'GLASGOW' (v. fine c.d.s. on the front) to 'Valparaiso' with very fine black 3-line 'POSTAGE NOT PAID' and octagon-boxed red small 'RETURNED FOR/[2/-] POSTAGE' (crease) marks both struck in Glasgow's Foreign Section ( and rare thus) and both nicely placed on the front. It seems that the postage was paid but that the letter was enclosed in a further address-sheet as there is a filing note that the letter was received (by the addressees presumably) on 31 Dec. 1860. Scottish Foreign Mail Instructional marks are rare. Exhibition Item.    	£240
