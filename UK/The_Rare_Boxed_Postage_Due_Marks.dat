2022  	 	VERY RARE LONDON FOREIGN BRANCH BOXED "D/8" CHARGE-MARK ON GREAT FIRE YEAR COVER EX HOLLAND; Exceptional 22 Oct. 1666 EL (minor dusting but with fine red wax seal and complete and sound) from "Amsterdam" addressed (in French) to "M. Louis Purent, Banquier a Londres" (received 4 Nov. 1666 according to the filing notes), having no postal markings except for a mostly fine strike of the very rare London Foreign Branch boxed "D/8" Postage Due mark (Jay L1030; 1663-67) nicely placed on the side-flap. This was the correct 8d single rate for mail from Holland to London from 1660 to 1711. It is interesting to note that this letter reached London only a few weeks after the Great Fire; perhaps the lack of an arrival Bishop Mark is due to a shortage of handstamps after the Fire (one 22 Oct. 1666 Bishop Mark cover has been recorded, otherwise, no others are known from the 10 weeks following the 2nd Sept. 1666 Fire.) Very few of these earliest of all British Postage Due marks exist, and only a handful of those are in private hands; we cannot recall having offered a finer example of these marks - nor any other "D/8" mark at all - in the last 20 years. The "D/8" mark is even rarer than the similar "D/9" and "S/1" marks. Important Exhibition Item for any P.H. collection, and an ideal Page One for a Postage Dues Exhibit.    	£1500

2023  	 	RARE LONDON FOREIGN BRANCH BOXED "D/9" CHARGE-MARK ON GREAT PLAGUE PERIOD COVER EX FRANCE; 3 Nov. [1665; dated from contents] large part EL (half address panel lost and worn lower fold but with complete contents with witty and informative details ref. wars, plague, etc.) from "Paris" addressed to an unknown "Cousin" at "Bath in Somerset, Angleterre" endorsed "to pay 11d" on the front, but having two strikes (one very fine and one partly off the edge) of the very rare London Foreign Branch boxed "D/9" Postage Due mark (Jay L1030; 1663-67) on the lower flap. This was the correct 6d single rate for mail from Holland to London from 1660 to 1711, but there was an extra 2d inland postage to pay ("up to 80 miles", being the long "measured" miles of the period, with Bath therefore placed at c.79 miles from London); so the boxed "D/9" mark has been endorsed "11". It is interesting to note that this letter reached London only a few weeks after the Great Plague; the contents include "I am very glad to hear that the sweeping pestilence that has hurried so many to the grave in London begins to abate its fury there..." Very few of these earliest of all British Postage Due marks exist, and only a handful of those are in private hands. Still exhibitable in spite of faults. A rare Plague Year letter. [Sold in Cavendish's Apr. 1999 auction - lot 576 - for £632.]    	£500
