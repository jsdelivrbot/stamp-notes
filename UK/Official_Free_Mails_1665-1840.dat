LETTER FROM LONDON TO ESSEX; 13/14 Oct. 1665 EL (some toning, mainly inside, but complete) from "Cockpitt" (London) addressed "For Sir James Altham, Knt. of the Bath, to be communicated to the rest of the Deputy Lieutenants of the County of Essex at Harlowe in Essex" but endorsed "For His Matie's Service and signed "Albemarle" ion the front beside the unusual endorsement; "To be sent by the Postm[aste]r of the next stage to Harlow in Essex", with a very fine "OC/14" Bishop Mark (rare during the year of London's Great Plague) on the lower flap. Sealed with three wax seals (the central larger one with "HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE"); the letter concerns a number of prisoners held in Essex about whom the addressee had asked for Albemarle's opinion. Albemarle states that he only knows one of the men and so they can all be released as long as they swear the oaths "of allegiance and supremacy" first. Rare historical letter with a fine address and rare Plague Year Bishop Mark.  1200
