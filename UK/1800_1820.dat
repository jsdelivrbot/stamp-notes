##Britain
Among the handstamps of the London Foreign Branch, there is a rectangular one bearing the word "Holland" in italic capitals. This was firrst mentioned in Jay and later two copies were found. The earlier
one is illustrated below.

2056  	 	RARE AUSTRIAN COVER FROM G.B.

Plus 1802 E & part E to London ex Rheims/Cadiz, and 1809 EL to Oporto all with relevant black/red "FOREIGN/OFFICE" c.d.s.'s. (4 items)    	£240

The second example oddly is dated as late as 1842. It appears that this mark was reserved solely
for mail sent prepaid from Holland to the Cape of Good Hope.

2058  	 	BRITISH OCCUPATION OF EGYPT - RARE "FOREIGN/OFFICE" 'EXPERIMENTAL' D.S. ON DISINFECTED COVER; 1 Nov. 1802 - 9 Feb. 1803 EL (minor edge toning) from a senior British Army Officer ("J. Stuart") in "Alexandria" to London with rastel-holes from disinfection and with a blurred circular "...DI DENTRO..." Disinfection Cachet (Austrian?) on the reverse along with a mostly very fine strike of the very short-lived single-ring "FOREIGN/OFFICE" London arrival d.s. (Jay L1005); charged "8", "11" (red crayon) and then "1/4". The letter asks for the addressee's help in gaining preferment for Lord Blantyre, then also in Egypt, and bemoans the uncertainty of the British situation there; "If we are to be withdrawn, our procrastination of the measure without some explanation displeases the Turks..." Rare early letter from the British Occupation of Egypt after the expulsion of Napoleon's forces the previous year.    	£200

The handstamp on the earlier cover, belonging to the postal history collection of Harper was in red and was sold by Cavendish in 2009.

Jay illustrated this handstamp in his London book based on a proof from the Post Office Archives. I will be interested to find out if anyone has any more copies of these handstamps. There are no marks of the Cape at the back.

Rare; very few covers have been recorded that were sent abroad via Plymouth during this famous Mutiny.    	£300

1810 Mutiny at Falmouth - by crew of Prince Adolphus, on 24 Oct.1810, led to the eight remaining packets being escorted under the guns of three RN ships to Plymouth to continue their work. However the move from Falmouth was a mistake and a year later in February 1811 all thirteen packets not on service were returned to Falmouth.
