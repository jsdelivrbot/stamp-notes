Anybody collecting Liverpool ship marks will probably know of Alan Robertson's famous book1 originally printed in 1955 as a limited edition of 600 copies with sections A through E. They will also know of the follow-up published by Colin Tabeart in 19972 which updates section E in one smaller book. The Liverpool postal marks were split into three main sections, ship marks "S", packet letters "P", and miscellaneous "M" in order to better catalogue the many marks of that port. For example, the first two Liverpool Packet marks are designated P1 and P2.

Tabeart's book does not attempt to indicate scarcity so this article is just to show some of the rarest and hardest marks to obtain. This is not to say that any other Liverpool marks are not collectable, but these are some of the ones that can empty your pockets. The examples shown start at the lowest "scarce" value and climb upwards, any valuations shown are known values from auctions but these could vary depending on the date and place of the auction. Also the authors must point out that most of the covers are taken from recent auctions and none are from their own collections

Fig 5 shows the EXSL 1 Exempt Ship Letter cancellation. It was proofed on the 4th September 1840 and used in black until 1864. The mark was added to consignees' letters addressed to the port of landing. Such letters paid no ship letter or inland rate, although there was still a 2d charge due to the Post Office to recompense for the Master's Gratuity. The mark was in use for 24 years but on rare occasions and good copies are hard to find, hence the premium value placed on a good example.
