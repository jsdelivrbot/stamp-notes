## Gibraltar
Gibraltar is a British overseas territory located at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar. The territory covers 6.843 square kilometres (2.642 sq mi) and shares a land border with Spain to the north. Gibraltar has historically been an important base for the British Armed Forces and is the site of a Royal Navy base. The philately of Gibraltar is inexorably linked to its strategic position and military connections.

###First stamps

The first stamp issue Gibraltar were stamps of Bermuda overprinted with the inscription \textsc{GIBRALTAR} and issued in January 1886.

Before that British and Spanish stamps were used according to the type of mail and other arrangements were in place before the invention of postage stamps. British stamps used in Gibraltar may be identified by the use of cancels containing the numeral A26 or the letter G in oval bars.[1]



###Queen Victoria

From November 1886 Gibraltar had its own stamps including the word Gibraltar in the design with seven values from 1/2d to 1 shilling. 

From 1889 these stamps were overprinted in centimos until British currency began to be used again in 1898.

###Queen Elizabeth II

The first stamp of Gibraltar for the reign of Queen Elizabeth II was the 1/2d Coronation commemorative omnibus stamp issued on 2 June 1953.
The post in Gibraltar is currently run by the Royal Gibraltar Post Office which in 2005 was granted the title of "Royal" by Her Majesty the Queen.[2] Gibraltar is now the only Commonwealth or British Overseas Territory outside the United Kingdom that bears this distinction.[2] The Gibraltar Post Office is now known as the Royal Gibraltar Post Office.

The Queen Elizabeth II stamps have produced some spectacular errors that are listed
in catalogues.
