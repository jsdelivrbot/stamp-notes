Watermark Crown to Right of CA isn't a watermark error as such - its a term Gibbons use to simplify the concept of "watermark sideways" versus "watermark sideways inverted". For each set with watermark sideways there will be a "correct" orientation but there is no general rule of whether the paper was rotated 90 degrees left or right - off the top of my head I think in the QEII period there was different default orientation for Block CA than for the later Spiral CA (or it might have been more complicated and changed over time periods as well).

So Watermark Crown to Right of CA means that from the reverse of the stamp you should see the crown being right of the CA. Many sets have a footnote saying something like "The normal sideways watermark shows Crown to left of CA as seen from the back of the stamp".
