Paul Kayfetz in article in the London Philatelist (Kayfetz, 1989) described a number of De La Rue Specimen File Pages. The most important one, shown in Figure 2, gives a complete overview of the Queen Victoria issues. From left to right the vertical files show the progression from the provisional overprinting of Bermuda stamps, the first regular issue in English currency, the temporary Spanish currency overprints, thee regular Spanish currency issue, and the return to a regular currency issue.

The various dates contained in these printer's archives sheets reflect the date the various issues were invoiced or were shipped, rather than the date they went on sale at the Gibraltar Post Office.

The Bermuda overprints labelled 'Dec 85' were shipped on 22 December 1885 and they were placed on sale on 1 Janury 1886.
