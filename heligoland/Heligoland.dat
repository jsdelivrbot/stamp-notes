## Heligoland

_By Dr. Y. Lazarides, January 2009_

__These pages explore the ninenteeth and twentieth history of Heligoland (Helgoland), its stamps and postal history.
Heligoland was seized by the British during the Napoleonic Wars in 1807 and occupied until 1890, when it was returned to Germany under the terms of
the Heligoland-Zanzibar treaty.__

__It became a centre of smuggling and espionage against Napoleon. 
Thousands of Germans fled to Britain and to the King's German Legion via Heligoland. 
In 1826, Heligoland became a seaside spa and soon it turned into a popular 
tourist resort for upper-class people. The island also attracted artists and writers, 
especially from Germany and even Austria who enjoyed the freedom of the benignly ruled (British) island, 
e.g. Heinrich Heine and August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben. 
It was a refuge for revolutionaries of the 1830 and 1848 German revolutions.__

Britain gave up the islands to Germany in 1890 (by virtue of the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty) and also gave up its interests in Madagascar to the French, in return for those countries surrendering their claims to the African island of Zanzibar (now a part of Tanzania), largely so the British could intervene there to suppress the slave trade.[citation needed] A "grandfathering"/optant approach prevented the Heligolanders (as they were named in the British measures) from forfeiting advantages because of this imposed change of status.
