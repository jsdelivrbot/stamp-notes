###Capture or Heligoland.

_Extract of a letter from Vice. Admiral Russell, to the Hon. Wellesley Pole ; 
dated Majestic, off Heligoland, Sept. 6, 1807._ 


<p class=small>I beg you will be pleased to acquaint my lords commissioners of the admiralty, that I arrived at this island, 
and anchored close to the town, on the 4th instant, at half past two P. M. but did not, 
as I expected, find the Explosion, the Wanderer, or the Exertion, with 
which their lordships had intended to reinforce me.</p>

Having found that {{wi:lord_Falkland}} had, with his usual zeal and promptness, summoned the garrison on the 30th ultimo, and that his proposals were rejected by the governor, I was making my arrangements to storm him with the marines and seamen of the squadron if he did not instantly surrender ; for at this time the value of the island to us is immense.

At six P. M. however, he sent out a flag of truce, desiring that an officer might be sent in the morning 
to treat on articles of capitulation ; and accordingly, at daylight, yesterday morning, 
dispatched lord viscount Falkland, and lieutenant D'Auvergne (first of this ship) for that service.

At two P. M. the deputation returned with the articles of capitulation, 
which I immediately ratified. With a small expence, this island may be made a little Gibraltar, 
and a safe haven for. small craft, even in the winter j it is a key to the rivers Ems, Weser, Jade, Elbe, and Eyder, the only asylum at present for our cruisers in these seas'.

I have appointed lieut. D'Auvergne as acting governor until their

lordships' pleasure is known ; and I beg leave to add, that from his perfect knowledge of both services, his zeal and loyalty, and a high sense of honour, I know no seaman more competent to the trust. (Signed) T.macnamak.a Russell. Extract of another Letter from the

Vice-Admiral) dated on the same

day,

This morning, the __Explosion__, __Wanderer__, and __Exertion__, hove in sight round the north end of the island.
