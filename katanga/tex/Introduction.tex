\section{Stamps and Postal History of Katanga}
The State of Katanga seceded from the Congo on July 11th, 1960 and existed until January 15th, 1963 as an independent state. It was headed by Moise Tshombe, a charismatic politician who was connected to the Lunda tribe royal family. Tshombe was elected president of Katanga in August 1960, and declared that "we are seceding from chaos".

Katanga initially overprinted Congo stamps, but soon issues it's own postage.

Katanga postal stationary I believe was limited to overprinted Congo issues. Used postal covers are highly sought by collectors.

Katanga is a fairly inexpensive area to collect, where you can collect the full country stamps and extending the search to commercially used covers can provide for an interesting collection without breaking the bank.
