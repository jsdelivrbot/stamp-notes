# Alexandretta

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Hatay State.

## Background

\lettrine{A}{fter} the First World War the Sanjak of Alexandretta became part of the 
French Mandate of Syria, under a special statute, but Turkey demanded 
its return as the area was ethnically divided between Turks, Sunni Arabs, 
and large numbers of Alawites. 

In July 1939, much to the resentment of the Syrians, France ceded the 
Sanjak of Alexandretta to Turkey, largely to secure Turkey's friendship 
in the upcoming European conflict. There was a public vote a plebiscite
held, and the people of Alexandretta wanted to join free state of Turkey 
instead of joining a French mandated Syria.
Since then Syria has continued to claim the region.
