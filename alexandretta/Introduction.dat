# Alexandretta

\lettrine{İ}{skenderun} or Scanderoon (Ancient Greek: Αλεξανδρέττα "Little Alexandria"), historically known as Alexandretta, is a city and the largest district in the province of Hatay on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey...

The city was founded as Alexandria (’Αλεξάνδρεια) and named for Alexander the Great.
Starting in the Middle Ages, Western pilgrims used the diminutive Romance form Alexandretta.[3]

After the Muslim conquest of Syria, it was named al-ʼIskandarūn (Arabic الإسكندرون), the Arabic rendering of the original "Alexandrou"; this name was further turkified into Ottoman Turkish as İskenderūn (إسكندرون), which in turn was preserved into its current modern Turkish form as İskenderun.

This is article is about  the postage stamps and postal history of Hatay State. Before its
status as a separate entity correspondence was handled as part of Syria. Stamps and covers from the French Levant offices are known.

## Background

\lettrine{A}{fter} the First World War the Sanjak of Alexandretta became part of the 
French Mandate of Syria, under a special statute, but Turkey demanded 
its return as the area was ethnically divided between Turks, Sunni Arabs, 
and large numbers of Alawites. 

In July 1939, much to the resentment of the Syrians, France ceded the 
Sanjak of Alexandretta to Turkey, largely to secure Turkey's friendship 
in the upcoming European conflict. There was a public vote a plebiscite
held, and the people of Alexandretta wanted to join free state of Turkey 
instead of joining a French mandated Syria.
Since then Syria has continued to claim the region.
