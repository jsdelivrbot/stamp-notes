Die proofs of the Tercentenary design with the 1d. value in the ten different colours 
of the issued stamps from the ½d. to the 5/- value are also known. 
Another fascinating modern die proof is on thin card in brown and blue overprinted 
“SPECIMEN” and attached to a circular sent by the Colonial Secretary to the Officer    
 Administering each of the 44 Crown Colonies regarding the forthcoming issue of the 
1935 Silver Jubilee stamps - only three examples of this item are known at present. 
I will now deal with specimen stamps as necessary but do not propose to mention 
them individually as this has recently been done expertly by Marcus Samuel in his 
book “Specimen Stamps of the Crown Colonies 1857-1948” which is a “must” if not 
already on your bookshelf. Marcus Samuel has recorded his knowledge and 
information about specimen stamps in a manner which is very clear and easy to 
understand and his knowledge in particular on this his special subject is unrivalled. 
Owing to the production of only a small number of specimen stamps of each issue, 
it stands to reason that the moment interest begins to be generated in them the supply 
gets short and the price starts to rise. For many many years specimen stamps were 
unpopular and could be purchased very cheaply by those few collectors who wished to 
develop this particular aspect of their collections. This has all changed during the last 
ten years or so and with Catalogue Editors now listing and pricing specimen stamps 
and the undoubted fillip which will be given to the collecting of specimen stamps as a 
result of Marcus Samuel’s book, specimen stamps are likely to be very much sought 
after in the years to come. 
“Watchman” writing on “Market Movements” in “Stamp Collecting Weekly” 
issued on June 9th 1977 crystallizes my feelings exactly when he stated as follows:- 
 
“Moral: wherever “Specimen” sets are priced lower than ordinary stamps don’t hesitate 
- they will assuredly pass them in time.” 
 
I would only add that in my opinion it will not take long for this to happen 
generally. I would like to take this opportunity and record one item which has not been 
included in Marcus Samuel’s book. It is the 6d. green SG.2 which has the 
“CANCELLED” handstamp Samuel Type 07. Both this and the similar handstamp on 
the ld. red SG.1 are extremely rare. 

Generally speaking, it must be admitted that the Queen Victoria Montserrat 
“SPECIMEN” and “CANCELLED” stamps are very scarce and difficult to find. From 
Edward VIl’s reign onwards, however, the position is at present different and they have 
been reasonably easy to obtain up to now, but this situation can change dramatically if 
there is an upsurge in demand.  

SG.9 2½d red-brown can be picked up as a single with part original gum or used,
but it seems to be a difficult stamp in multiples. I have only seen or heard of four
blocks of four and one horizontal strip of three with part original gum, one of the
blocks being climatically toned.


As for the used stamp, I have only noted three horizontal pairs, one pair being rust
stained partly.


There was one consignment by De la Rue of SG.9 2½d red-brown to the colony
consisting of 8,040 stamps.

SG.10 2½d ultramarine is not a stamp that much can be written about: I have seen
or heard of only six blocks of four with part original gum and, so far as used examples
are concerned, I do not know of any multiples.
This is rather puzzling because the Stanley Gibbons Catalogue value for this stamp
is not high; however, in an auction sale of a very fine collection of Montserrat in March
1977 there was only one block of four of this stamp with part original gum and no used
example offered and I can only conclude that here again, as in the case of the 1d rosered,
the catalogue value has for years taken no account of the scarcity. There were three
consignments by De la Rue of SG.10 2½d ultramarine to the colony totalling 16,200
stamps.

SG.11 4d blue with part original gum is a rare item and I know of only one block of
four with part original gum and have never heard of any used multiples although used
singles turn up reasonably often. Incidentally, this is the only Montserrat stamp which
Jean de Sperati reproduced and as his reproductions are superb beware of used
35
examples with the forged “A08” obliterator in different positions on the reproduced
stamp. There was one consignment by De la Rue of SG.11 4d blue to the colony
consisting of 3,900 stamps.

SG.12 4d mauve is not a stamp which is seen frequently in a multiple. I have seen
only one block of six and three blocks of four with part original gum and one horizontal
strip of three used. Singles of this stamp with part original gum or in used condition are
fairly common. Covers with this stamp are however extremely rare and I have seen or
heard of only two covers. The well known Montserrat collection auctioned in March
1977 apparently contained no example of this stamp as none was offered for sale in the
Auction Catalogue. A possible explanation for its absence is that when the collection
was formed between the two World Wars the stamp was considered to be so common
at that time that the owner of the collection did not trouble to acquire it. There were
four consignments by De la Rue of SG.12 4d mauve to the colony totalling 29,400
stamps.

SG.13 1d red perf 12 was I believe an experimental printing and it was not large. I
have seen or heard of two blocks of six and five blocks of four with part original gum,
one strip of four used on small piece and two covers, one being a mourning cover to
Scotland with a horizontal strip of four and the other cover to Birmingham bearing
twelve 1d stamps and both the latter cover itself and most of the twelve stamps have
faults. This 1d stamp is also found with the inverted ‘S’ variety in ‘MONTSERRAT”.
The stamp can also be found bisected vertically and diagonally for use as a ½d; and
when on cover it can be without a surcharge or with a black “½” surcharge or a red “½”
surcharge. For further details of covers of this nature you are again referred to an article
entitled “MONTSERRAT and DOMINICA”. “The 1d bisects and bogus “½” on pages
63 to 66 (inclusive) in Bulletin No.86, September 1975.
There was one consignment by De la Rue of SG.13 1d red perf 12 to the colony
consisting of 6,480 stamps.
The consignment figures have been obtained from pages 66 and 67 of the London
Philatelist for 1969 and you may wish to refer to The London Philatelist for details of
the dates of consignments and the number of stamps consigned.

I cannot leave the Queen Victoria stamps printed from the Perkins, Bacon & Co.,
plates without referring to the re-entries which are to be found on the 1d and 6d values.
As these are stamps of Antigua overprinted “MONTSERRAT” the re-entries are the
same for both countries and are much sought after by specialists.
As far as scarcity is concerned a re-entry on a Montserrat 1d or 6d is approximately
twice as difficult to find as on the equivalent Antigua stamp. There are of course reentries
to be found on SG.3 6d blue-green. If there was only one sheet of this stamp
printed, as seems likely, then a stamp from the sheet with a re-entry will be unique and
it is therefore certainly as scarce as and possibly even more scarce than the inverted ‘S’
variety on this stamp of which variety two examples may have been printed although at
present only one example is known to exist.

I do not propose to say very much about the stamps of this country after Queen
Victoria’s reign for two reasons. First, I have never specialised in them and therefore do
not know very much about them; and secondly, I have always suspected that the stamps
of Edward VII and George V were so well and uniformly printed that there is not much
scope for the specialist to find out a great deal of interest. The stamps of George VI’s
      
reign are probably more interesting; due to the vicissitudes of War these could provide
some interest to a specialist in connection with printings, paper, shades, etc., but even
here, the amount of interest that can be generated is limited as compared for example
with Leeward Islands stamps of the same reign. However, if you are interested in the
George VI stamps you should acquire “The Printings of King George VI Colonial
Stamps” by W.J.W. Potter and Lt. Col. R.C.M. Shelton, MBE; this book will enable
you to make a good start.
As regards the Queen Elizabeth stamps, I believe that there are catalogues which
note the varieties and you should obtain a catalogue best suited to your purpose and go
on from there.
I now come to the early postal history and the postal markings of this island and
cannot do better than to refer you to “The early Postal History of Montserrat 1702-
1900” by L.E. Britnor published in the issues of Stamp Collecting on November 23rd
and 30th 1962 which sets out the position most clearly.

I refer you also to our Study Circle’s Paper No.4 entitled “MONTSERRAT” also
by L.E. Britnor which is a monograph dealing with all aspects of philately relating to
this former colony. Recently a new three line packet type mark not so far located in
G.P.O. Records or previously seen in use has been found. It is on an 1801 entire letter
to London showing “MT/SERRAT/JAN 13 1802”. The early postal markings are very
difficult to acquire and one needs now great patience and a deep purse as well for the
fine strikes. Only very few examples of each strike or marking are known; sometimes
only two or three examples are known to exist and when an example comes on the
market it fetches a big price as there is no knowing when it will be available again.

From about 1890 the number of different types of postal markings gradually began
to increase but this island has never been able to compete with Antigua, Dominica or
St. Kitts as regards the quantity of different types of postal markings. The formation of
a postmark collection is feasible therefore for these who do not wish to spend large
amounts. Surprisingly it took me a number of years to acquire a complete used
collection of the catalogued stamps up to 1938: why not try doing this to begin with?
You can also add to the interest of such a collection by also including Leeward Islands
stamps with Montserrat postmarks.

In conclusion, I will only say that some aspects of the collecting of Montserrat are
difficult and other aspects are much easier to surmount, thus providing a contrast to suit
all tastes and pockets.

I hope that my remarks have proved interesting and that people have been
encouraged to take up this country which has for far too long not received the
recognition which it deserves except from a comparatively small number of collectors.
Good hunting to those of you who decide to join the band of collectors of this former
colony!!
