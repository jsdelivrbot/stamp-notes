\chapter{Montserrat}

## Background

Montserrat  is a Caribbean island that is a British overseas territory. It is located in the Leeward Islands, part of the chain of islands known as the Lesser Antilles, in the West Indies. The island of Montserrat measures approximately 16 km (9.9 mi) long and 11 km (6.8 mi) wide, with approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) of coastline.[2] Montserrat is nicknamed The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean both for its resemblance to coastal Ireland and for the Irish ancestry of some of its inhabitants.


Montserrat, a British colony, formerly issued stamps concurrently with the Leeward Islands until they were withdrawn in 1956. 

However, the very first Montserrat issue in 1876 used the 1d. red and 6d. green stamps of Antigua overprinted MONTSERRAT.
