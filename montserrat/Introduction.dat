Montserrat  is a Caribbean island that is a British overseas territory. It is located in the Leeward Islands, part of the chain of islands known as the Lesser Antilles, in the West Indies. The island of Montserrat measures approximately 16 km (9.9 mi) long and 11 km (6.8 mi) wide, with approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) of coastline.[2] Montserrat is nicknamed The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean both for its resemblance to coastal Ireland and for the Irish ancestry of some of its inhabitants.


Montserrat, a British colony, formerly issued stamps concurrently with the Leeward Islands until they were withdrawn in 1956. 

However, the very first Montserrat issue in 1876 used the 1d. red and 6d. green stamps of Antigua overprinted MONTSERRAT. 



It is appropriate at this time to pen some notes on Montserrat as a superb collection 
formed over a period of about fifty years was auctioned in March 1977 in London and 
many items from that collection have been seen rarely on the market over the years. 
Philatelically speaking, this is a comparatively small country, but as with most 
countries, depending on how you collect, it can be very difficult or as easy as you may 
wish to make it. 

The next thing that should be said is that the material up to 1900 is either very 
scarce or comparatively scarce and even the stamps of the reigns of Edward VII and 
George V are by no means as easy to collect as the stamps of these reigns from most 
other countries. 

To commence with I propose to mention proofs. The first item in this category is 
the 6d. blue-green (SG.3) which to all appearance is an adhesive stamp but it cannot be 
regarded as such - more about this later in these notes. The design adopted for SG.4, 5, 
6, 9, 10, 11 and 12 is to be found in two dies known as Die I and Die II, but only Die I 
was employed for eight countries including Antigua, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Lucia, 
Turks Islands and Virgin Islands in the British West Indies. De la Rue & Co., were the 
printers and the design is generally known as “the Cyprus type” although the stamps of 
Cyprus were not the first issued in this design. 

Die proofs exist on glazed card in black 
with uncleared name and value tablets and in the form of a master die proof with blank 
name and value tablets. A die proof of the 1½d. value is to be found in black on glazed 
card dated Sep 1 1879 and this relates to the postcard with this value printed on it in 
brown. Imperforate plate proofs of the Queen Victoria stamps from 1880 onward exist 
but these are very rare, and apart from SG.4 2½d. red-brown of which I have seen four 
examples, but in the case of SG.6 ½d. dull green, SG.7 1d red, SG.10 2½d. ultramarine 
and SG.12 4d. mauve I have so far seen only one example of each; however, others 
must surely exist. In 1883 De la Rue & Co., prepared a colour trial of the 1d. in sepia

  and apart from the example in the Royal Collection I have seen only one other example 
in private hands, that is, excluding the De la Rue Archives. 
In the case of the Edwardian stamps showing the Device of the Colony with face 
values ½d. to 2/6d. (both inclusive), it would seem that two types of die were used (not 
to be confused with the two Dies I and II previously referred to which have no 
connection with the two types of die now being mentioned).

One type of die consisted of the frame with “MONTSERRAT” and a different 
value in each value tablet. The other type of die was of the vignette of the Device of the 
Colony. Progressive die proofs pulled from each die are known but are not very 
frequently seen, particularly is this the case with the proofs of the vignette only, as I 
have seen only one progressive die proof of the vignette and one original die proof 
dated March 7th (1903). Mention must also be made of imperforate colour trials in 
1903 of the ½d. value and an imperforate plate proof in the same value. The Edwardian 
5/- value was a large format stamps and two different dies were used. Die proofs exist 
of the frame with name and value but with blank vignette on the usual glazed cards. 
Likewise, die proofs exist of the central vignette consisting of the King’s head against a 
partly shaded background with an oval frame line; both the frame die and the vignette 
die were adopted for the 5/- value of Antigua and Dominica as well with the necessary 
difference of name of Colony. Bi-coloured colour trials of the 5/- value of Montserrat 
are also to be found. 

Progressive die proofs in black on glazed card exist of the frame of the 1916-23 set 
of stamps with both the value tablet and surrounds uncleared and with and without 
“MONTSERRAT”; value tablet die proofs are also to be found. Original die proofs of 
the value tablet are available for most values of the 1922-29 set. Die proofs are also to 
be found in respect of the complete design and value of several of the stamps of the 
1922-29 set, each proof being on a piece of glazed card approximately the size of the 
adhesive stamp which it represents. These proofs are not considered to be ‘cut down’ 
die proofs; it is thought that they were pulled for the purpose of testing the accuracy of 
the registration of the frame die and the value tablet die and at present only one proof of 
each value is known apart from the 4/- value of which I have now seen two apparently 
‘cut down’ die proofs. The fact that so far no die proof of the combined frame and 
value tablet in black on a full sized glazed card is recorded tends to support the view 
that these die proofs are as made originally and are not cut down proofs. 
De la Rue & Co., reached a very high standard when printing the 1932 Tercentenary set 
by the recess method. The few known die proofs are finely made and most artistic and 
attractive. 

There is the master die proof in black with blank value tablets on thick wove paper 
of which I have seen three or four examples; also a die proof of the 6d. in trial colour 
blue on thick wove paper with small margins of which I have seen two examples; also 
die proofs of the ½d. and 6d. values in trial colour blue on thick paper with much larger 
margins which must be very rare indeed.
