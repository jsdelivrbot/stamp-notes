\chapter{Mail Service, 1842-84}


The following information, which has been gleaned mainly from the 
perusal of letters in the G.P.O. Records, throws some interesting light on 
the postal arrangements for Montserrat during part of the 19th century. 
Where it seems appropriate actual quotations have been given. 
When the R.M.S.P. Co. began operating in 1842 Montserrat was served 
regularly by the new Service. Under a fresh arrangement, however, which 
came into operation about the end of 1852, the Island lost the direct service 
of the steamers, and the mail was brought to and from St. Kitts by means of 
sailing craft (vide. Petition to Earl of Kimberley, 23rd February, 1874). 
From 26th September, 1864 to 31st December, 1879, Frederick Slater 
Cassin, of Antigua, held a contract to convey mails between St. Kitts, Nevis 
and Montserrat, in sailing vessels, twice a month. For this he received a 
subsidy of £490 a year from the Post Office.

Extract from letter from Jos. Sturge to Sir M. Hicks Beach, Principal 
Secretary of State for the Colonies: 
"Prior to 1st January, 1880, there was maintained the uncertain and 
unsatisfactory fortnightly sailing service." 

Between 1865 and 1884 various members of the Sturge family (who 
constituted the Montserrat Co., Ltd) made strenuous efforts to have the 
service improved; but most of their petitions were rejected, either by the 
R.M.S.P. Co., on the grounds that it would make the time schedule too 
tight, or by the P.M.G. on the score of expense. 

In 1875 there was a proposed new contract for the Packet ships to call at 
Montserrat outward on the voyage starting from St. Thomas on the 26th of 
the month, and homeward, starting from Barbados on the 1st of the month. 
In connection with this the following is part of a letter from the P.M.G. to 
the Treasury, dated 23rd June, 1875. 

"As regards the cost of the proposed service, I beg leave to state to your 
Lordships that, considering the very small amount of sea postage derived 
from the correspondence with Montserrat - estimated at about £137 a year - 
and the expense already incurred by this Department in maintaining the 
Mail Service to and from that Colony I cannot recommend that the offer of 
the company be accepted, or, at any rate that any portion of the additional 
£500 a year should be paid from imperial funds." 

In a further letter from the P.M.G. to the Treasury, dated 20th 
September, 1878, it is stated: 
"For your Lordships' information I think it right to add that the sea 
postage derived from the correspondence of Montserrat amounts to only 
about £200 a year." 

Clauses 6 and 7 of the new Contract with the R.M.S.P. Co., drawn up on 
12th August, 1878, provided that their vessels should call off Montserrat to 
deliver and embark mails on each voyage from Barbados to St. Thomas and 
from St. Thomas to Barbados, at an additional charge of £500 per annum. 
This took effect as from 1st January, 1880, the monthly call of the steamer 
being interspersed with a sailing boat service. 

On 15th August, 1879, the President of Montserrat, Neall Porter, wrote 
to the Colonial Secretary stating that he had arranged for the conveyance of 
mails during 1880 by the Sloop "Gwendoline" (12 tons, comparatively 
new, owned and commanded by Mr. Richard Thornbill) for the sum of 
£90 - the only other tender was one for £320. 

Extract from a letter from the Montserrat Co., Ltd. to the P.M.G. written 
on 13th March, 1884. 

"Understanding that a new Contract is under negotiation for the West 
Indies Postal Service, we take the liberty of calling your Lordship's 
attention to the importance of securing for the island of Montserrat a 
fortnightly call from the mail steamers instead of a call monthly as at 
present. 

"The experiment of calling monthly has now been tried for several years 
and has proved most succesful. The delay to the mail steamers has proved 
to be quite trifling and the island has benefited thereby very much, while 
we believe the Steamboat Co. must themselves have secured a satisfactory 
business. 

"The alternative fortnightly sailing service has on the other hand been of 
the most unsatisfactory character. The voyage from St. Kitts, a deadbeat to 
windward, is so protracted that the mails are delayed 24 and sometimes 
even 36 hours on a voyage which only occupies the steamer 4 hours." 
The P.M.G. sent a copy of this letter to the Treasury on 17th April, 
1884, together with the following observations: 

"Owing to the representations then made "(this phrase refers to 
correspondence c. 1878)" on behalf of the Colony a clause was introduced 
into the Contract with the R.M.S.P. Co., requiring them to call at 
Montserrat once a month, on the voyage of the Packet between St. Thomas 
and Barbados for an additional subsidy of £500 a year over and above the 
general subsidy for the Mail Service. The Colony, on its part, agreed to 
provide an alternative service once a month by means of a sailing vessel .... 
The application now made by the Montserrat Co. is to have the contract 
service doubled at the expense of the Imperial Revenue, the monthly sailing 
service which now alternates with the monthly call of the Packet, so as to 
give Montserrat a fortnightly Mail Service, not being considered by the 
Colony to be satisfactory. 

"Looking at the question from the Postal point of view I am unable to 
support the application. The amount of sea postage derived from the 
correspondence with the Island of Montserrat is now about £80 per annum 
and the contribution payable by the Colony towards the additional loss 
sustained by the Imperial Revenue in reducing the postage on its entry into 
the Postal Union is about £60 per annum. Thus the receipts are about £140 
a year as a set-off against the special expenditure of £500, over and above 
the proportion which may be set down to Montserrat in the cost of the main 
line between this country and the West Indies." 

On 24th April the Treasury replied, rejecting the proposal. 29
