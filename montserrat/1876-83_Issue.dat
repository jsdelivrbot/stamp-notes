 \chapter{1876-83  Issue}

The suggestion that the Antigua plates should be overprinted MONTSERRAT was made by the general Post Office in London in a letter of March 20, 1876, dealing with an application for the Colony to use Antigua stamps in the island, 'it being considered unadvisable to incur the expense of preparing a set of separate dies for Montserrat stamps.'. The Postmaster General sent a St Helena stamp, 'the value of which has been changed in the manner above indicated.' The Colonial Secretary on April 21st wrote to teh Crown Agents ordering 100 sheets One Penny and 50 sheets Sixpence so overprinted.
