Lot: 499	THE VERY RARE 1st-TYPE (LOOSE-TYPE) "MONTSERRAT" STRAIGHT-LINE IN THE 1st YEAR OF RECORDED USE; Remarkable 26 Feb. - 11 Mar. 1791 EL (interesting estate report ref. purchasing/shipping mules, Packets, slave fever, etc.) from "Mont Serrat" to London "[Per] Prince William Packett", having a mostly very fine small "MONTSERRAT" straight-line mark (RL HS1; recorded from Jan. 1791 only - light fold between "M" & "O" does not detract) nicely placed on the front; on arrival in London (23 Apr.), the "1/-" (single) rate was changed to "2/-" (double) with a very fine brown "Crown" Inspector's Mark. Very few examples of this first mark of Montserrat have been recorded. One of the earliest known letters from Montserrat and an Important Exhibition Item.		Estimated Value: £1200

Lot: 502				MONTSERRAT COVER TO G.B. WITH THE VERY RARE LARGE "ST. THOMAS" FLEURON DATESTAMP; 30 May 1810 EL from "Montserrat" (neatly folded to show the internal heading alongside the address-panel) to London charged "2/-" with a mostly very fine large "ST. THOMAS/JUN 4/1810" Fleuron c.d.s. (RL HS1; early usage, light crease) nicely placed on the front; carried by the Leeward Island Packet 'Princess Elizabeth II' via Falmouth. Remarkable and rare usage of this very elusive mark on an early cover from Montserrat; significantly, RL records no Montserrat markings at all between 1804 and 1836. Important Exhibition Item.
