### The Seahorses issue
This is an interesting printing in that it was printed by De La Rue, but 
there is also a 
more scarcer printing by Wilkinson. It is unclear why it was necessary 
to have Wilkinson print such a limited number of stamps.

Waterlow printing (22mm wide)
Note: these are extremely scarce, but are commoner with the "Specimen" overprint. It is not quite clear why a very small quantity (120 5/-, 60 10/-) of the Waterlow seahorses 
were included in the main batch of De La Rue printings.

The specimens for the De La Rue issue are also difficult to find and have a high catalogue value. The \textsc{SPECIMEN} overprint is in black in a slanted font. It is
identical to the one for the Wilkinson stamps.
