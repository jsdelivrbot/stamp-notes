###Pre-independence

The first post office on the island opened in 1905 using stamps of the Marshall Islands. From 1914 to 1916 Australian stamps overprinted North West Pacific Islands were used. The British government then took control of the island and British stamps overprinted NAURU were issued in October 1916. From 1924 stamps produced in Australia were used.[1]


###Independence

The first stamps of independent Nauru were issued in 1968.
