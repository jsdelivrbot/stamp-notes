The first post office on the island opened in 1905 using stamps of 
the Marshall Islands. From 1914 to 1916 Australian stamps overprinted 
North West Pacific Islands were used. 

The British government then took control of the island 
and British stamps overprinted NAURU were issued in October 1916.

The issues during this period produced some interesting and affordable varieties.

From 1924 stamps produced in Australia were used.


\section{Independence}

The first stamps of independent Nauru were issued in 1968.  


Revenues of this tiny island have traditionally come from exports 
of phosphates, but reserves are now depleted. Few other resources 
exist with most necessities being imported, mainly from Australia, 
its former occupier and later major source of support. The rehabilitation 
of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are 
serious long-term problems. In anticipation of the exhaustion of 
Nauru's phosphate deposits, substantial amounts of phosphate income 
have been invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and 
provide for Nauru's economic future. 

As a result of heavy spending 
from the trust funds, the government faces virtual bankruptcy. To cut 
costs the government has called for a freeze on wages, a reduction of 
over-staffed public service departments, privatization of numerous g
overnment agencies, and closure of some overseas consulates. 
In recent years Nauru has encouraged the registration of offshore 
banks and corporations. 

In 2004 the deterioration in housing, hospitals, and other capital 
plant continued, and the cost to Australia of keeping the government
and economy afloat has substantially mounted
