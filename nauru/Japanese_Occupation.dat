## Nauru

The Japanese occupied  Nauru over three years (26 August 1942 - 13 September 1945) during which Nauru, a Pacific island was occupied by the Japanese army as part of the operations of the Pacific War during World War II. With the onset of the War in the Pacific, islands that flanked the Japanese South Seas possessions were of great interest to the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters (IGHQ) with the Imperial Navy section in the lead. \ref{five}

Between the first and the third of October, the 3,745 Japanese and 
Koreans on the island were taken on board Allied ships heading for 
Bougainville Island in the Solomon Islands.[24] During the transfer, 
the former occupants where molested by the Nauruans in charge of the 
boarding operations.[25] They were also violently attacked with canes 
by Chinese seeking revenge on their former tormentors. The abusers 
were harshly pushed back by the Australians.
