\ph[60%]{../eritrea/379.jpg}{379		Sassone PP#2	Sassone PP#2, 1916 10c Blue with small "Eritrea" overprint, very rare key value of the first parcel post issue, deep rich color with prooflike impression, actually quite well centered for this and better than the vast majority of the small census of known mint examples, o.g., barest trace of hinging, very fine; an unusually elusive parcel post issue in this select quality; signed E(milio) Diena, G. Bolaffi and D. Bolaffi plus accompanied by a 1961 Dante Bolaffi certificate (Scott #Q2; $2,250.00). (Image)	\euro3,200

\ph[60%]{../eritrea/380.jpg}{380		Sassone PP#22	Sassone PP#22, 1937 10c Blue with large "Eritrea" overprint, the enormously rare parcel post value of the last issue and being also the last value of the set produced in 1937; bright blue color on fresh white paper, highly detailed impression and neatly applied overprints, o.g., n.h., centered to left as is normal, a fine and extraordinarily rare parcel post; this extraordinarily rare value is not only just the key item of this country but it ranks high with the other parcel post rarities that are found in the various Italian Colonies; signed A. D(iena), Raybaudi and others (Scott #Q21A; $5,250.00). \euro12,500
