The "East Africa Forces" were based in a huge area across North East and
East Africa and as far as Ceylon and Burma (the name refers to the area
from which the troops were drawn - eg Kenya - not the area where they served).
However the "EAF" overprints appear to have been used only in Somalia
("EAF" meter marks are known from other countries). Only one set was issued (15 January 1943).
As implied by the overprint the stamps were intended for use
by military personnel rather than primarily as a public service.

Note: for some reason these are referred to as "East Africa Forces" in
philatelic circles, though in military circles they are known as the
"East African Forces".
