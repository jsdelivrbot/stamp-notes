\chapter{Special Delivery Stamps.}    
The first purpose-designed airmail special delivery stamp was issued in 1932 by Italy. The 2.25-lira+1-lira Anniversary of the Death of Giuseppe Garibaldi airmail special delivery stamp (Scott CE1).
Italy was the most prolific user of special delivery airmail stamps, with nine issued from 1932 to 1934. Special delivery airmail stamps were also issued in the 1930s for the Aegean Islands, Italian East Africa, Libya, Tripolitania and the general Italian colonies. In 1924 two express delivery stamps were issued for use in Eritrea. The 60c was intended for internal mail, whilst the 2 Lire one for external. They have a most attractive design.

In 1935 the stamps were surcharged with new values. The 60c stamp was surcharged with a black overprint with the inscription "Lira/1,25" in Italian and Arabic. The stamp is highly catalogued both in mint as well as used condition. This surcharge was originally issued on the perforated 11 stamps in blue in 1927, in 1935, when they wanted to reissue the value, black ink was used on a few of the deep carmine perforated 11 stamps and continued in that same year on the red perforated 13 1/2 stamp, only reverting back to blue in 1937 on the red perforated 13 1/2 stamps; this printing is rare in mint or used but in mint it is a great special delivery rarity.
