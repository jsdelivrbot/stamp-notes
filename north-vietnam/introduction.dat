\chapter{North Vietnam}  

 The postage stamps of Vietnam were issued by a variety of states and administrations. Stamps were first introduced by the French colonial administration. Stamps specifically for Vietnam were first issued in 1945. During the decades of conflict and partitioning, stamps were issued by mutually hostile governments. The reunification of Vietnam in 1976 brought about a unified postal service 
 
\section{Advent of Vietnamese stamps}

Stamps in Vietnam were first introduced by the French colonial 
administration in 1862. The stamps of these decades were initially 
of the general French colonial series.[1] In the 1880s, some of these 
were overprinted locally for Cochinchina (1886-88), Annam and Tonkin (1888) 
and [French Indochina](../french-indochina/Introduction) (1889).[2] Subsequently, definitive stamps of 
French Indochina were issued. The colony of French Indochina consisted 
of present-day Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Stamps specifically for Vietnam were first issued in 1945.
During the Japanese occupation of French Indochina (1940-1945), 
the colonial administration did not receive fresh supplies of stamps from France. For this reason they resorted to printing their own stamps at a print shop in Hanoi. These stamps were of lower quality than the pre-war stamps, and in addition, the machinery used for this purpose gradually deteriorated, with limited possibilities of repairing it.

Some of the overprints were explicitly political in nature, e.g. "Quoc Phong" (national defence).
The advent of stamps specifically for Vietnam came with the defeat of Japan in 1945. In Vietnam, the Japanese surrender paved the way for the anti-Japanese Viet Minh movement, which presided over a guerilla army, to seize key cities and political power in Vietnam. During 1945-1946, the Viet Minh government issued a large number of provisional postage stamps. These stamps were manufactured by adding an overprint to remaining stocks of the war-era stamps of French Indochina. Eventually, a set of definitive stamps depicting Ho Chi Minh were issued in 1946.

The ensuing conflict between the returning French troops and the Viet Minh government brought an end to the initial series of Viet Minh stamps. During the conflict, stamps were issued in various Viet Minh held regions, while new issues of French Indochina stamps were used in areas controlled by the French. Around 1950, national governments for Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were established, each issuing stamps and coins in their own names. The first stamps of the Bi government in Vietnam were issued in 1951. These stamps supplanted the French Indochina stamps in the French controlled areas of Vietnam.
With the peace agreement in 1954, Vietnam was partitioned into a Northern and a Southern state. Each issued their own stamps.

\subsection{North Vietnam (1954-1976)}

Many stamps of North Vietnam were printed in Hanoi,[3] while others were printed abroad, e.g. in Prague, Czechoslovakia, (1958-59)[4] and subsequently in Budapest, Hungary


\subsection{South Vietnam (1954-1976)}



1971 South Vietnam stamp.
The stamps of South Vietnam were mostly printed in Paris, Tokyo, England (by De La Rue) and Rome during 1954-67,[6] in Japan during 1967-73[7] and in England (by De La Rue) during 1973-75.[8]
Stamps used by military personnel were printed locally[9] and are of inferior quality.


1965 NLF stamp.
Between 1963 and 1976, the insurgent National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (the NLF or "Viet Cong") issued their own stamps. These were printed in Hanoi.[10] When the Republic of Vietnam was toppled in May 1975, the NFL government became the sole stamp issuing authority, until the reunification of Vietnam one year later.

\section{Reunified Vietnam (1976-)}

The reunification of Vietnam in July 1976 brought about a unified postal service. This effectively consisted of the postal administration in Hanoi operating throughout Vietnam. Indeed, the stamps issued in July and August 1976 still had the name of the North Vietnamese state printed on them,[11] while later issues have simply "Viá»�t Nam" and "bÆ°u chÃ­nh" (mail). As in North Vietnam, post-reunification stamps were partly printed in Vietnam and partly abroad. Domestically printed stamps were printed in Hanoi 1976-1987 and subsequently in Saigon.[12] During 1983-1990 most stamp issues were printed in Havana, Cuba,[13] these were of a superior printing quality. Eventually, the postal service acquired improved technology from Germany. Since 1990 all stamps of Vietnam have been produced domestically.
