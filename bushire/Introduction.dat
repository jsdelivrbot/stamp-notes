\chapter{Bushire}

The provisional postage stamps issued in Bushire, the metropolis of the Persian Gulf during the British
Occupation, albeit the outcome of one of the minor operations of the Great War, are numbered amongst the rarest, as well as the
most interesting; from a philatelic standpoint of the Allied _Occupation_ issues of the Great War.

It was in consequence of local disturbances arising out of Austro-german intrigues in Persia, that it
was deemed necessary by the British Government to enter into temporary military occupation of the port
of Bushire to safeguard the life and property of the European and Indian community living there.

For many years an agency of the Bombay post office had been in operation in Bushire, where resided the
British political Resident for the Gulf. At the closing of autumn 91915) session of
the Legislative Council of India, at wi:Simla, the Viceroy, Lord Hardinge, announced that:
\clear

\begin{quotation}[shade]
Our troops our now occupying Bushire in the Persian Gulf, and with the consent of Persia will remain
there until steps are taken by the latter to restore internal peace and order.
\end{quotation}

The British expedition entered into occupation of the town on August 8th, 1915.

All postage stamps on hand at the local Persian post office were taken over by the British authorities, by whom were overprinted
__BUSHIRE Under British Occupation__. the overprint was in three lines of Long Primer type, and re-issued a week later.

The overprinting was done on a small printing machine, belonging to the British Residency, which was taken to the Persian post-office for the purpose and
returned when the work was completed. Apparently the type which was old and defective, was set up to overpint a single horizontal
row of ten stamps at each impression. There are believed to have been six settings the second containing a ntable variety,
with the __I__ omitted, reading __BUSH RE__, and the 3rd, 4th and 5th with no stop after
__Occupation__ on the ninth stamp in each row.

The stamps comprising this provisional issue were those of the 1911-13 series of Persia, with the 
portrait of the young Sha Ahmed Mirza; but a few of the latest coronation issues were also included.
These were in sheets of 50 for the lower values and small panes of 5 for those of the 1 kran and upwards.

__The type was therefore set for overprinting the whole of the series in a single row of 5 subjects only.__

The Coronation issue was brought into use sometime later in September, 1915. The twowi:toman
values being of an odd size were overprinted one stamp a a time.

The 1 kran of the Shah's Head series is said to exist with double overprint, in which state
at least ten copies presumably were issued. In the Coronation issue set a single pane of the 5 kran
is said to have received the overprint inverted. The values, colours and quantities of the two series of
stamps is shown in Table 1. 

The stamps were on sale at the both the Indian as well as the Persian post offices in Bushire, and since
the postal tariff at the former was at the rate of 1d. per ounce, as against 2 1/2, at the latter,
the majority passed through the Bombay agency.

\textbf{On October 18th, 1915, the town and district of Bushire was restored to Persia, and the British Occupation
stamps, after a currency of only eight weeks, ceased to circulate. It is unknown as to what happen of the remainders
but to resume that following the customary British Post Office procedures they must have been destroyed.}
