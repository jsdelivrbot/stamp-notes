auction: Schlegel, May 2009



The rare German {{wi:Audrey_Hepburn}} stamp will be auctioned May 26th in Berlin by the Schlegel auction house. It's valued at â‚¬30,000 (US$40,000).

There are four known copies of the stamp. The other copies have sold for as much as US$200,000.

In October 2005, VSC Special Correspondent Randall Sherman reported, "The stamp had originally been planned to be issued after Hepburn's death in 1993, but was pulled well before its scheduled release following objections from Hepburn's son (who refused to agree to the stamp's release, apparently because the stamp showed his mother, who died of lung cancer, smoking)."
