1947-48 Marion Island Postal History, an exceptional assemblage of early 
mail from this remote and desolate island (actually two islands) in southern Indian Ocean, 
now annexed by South Africa, begins with two previously unrecorded examples of the first canceller known, the large violet "Marion Island" double circle postmark (each dated December 29, 1947, and both also have the boxed "Marion Island/South Indian Ocean" handstamp at bottom, one is a 1p postal card of South Africa, the other franked with a South African stamp, followed by seven 1947-48 covers all bearing the boxed aforementioned handstamp, franked with South African adhesives and addressed to various South African towns, one cover having been sent and initialed by "A.B. Crawford/Ast. Postmaster/First Official Mail" and numbered "9", ten covers in all, almost all fine-very fine; a scarce and well annotated collection of these elusive covers. (Image) 	Est. $750-1,000

###South African occupation

In December 1947 a Union of South Africa expedition named Operation Snoektown \footnote{test}  led by Lieutenant Commander
John Fairbath aboard the frigade H.M.S.A.S. _Transvaal_, claimed the island and on the 4th of january 1948, its neighbour, Prince Edward
Island.

Later a shore party (from _Gamtoos_, 20 JAnuary 1948) began 
building a station on Marion Island and establishing the first settlement for scientific purposes.

###First Mail

There was some mention of establishing a post office on Marion, but the haste of the expedition's departure, and the interference of other matters, 
left the action unresolved. {{footnote: 2}} when _Transvaal_ first arrived.

But the apparent foresight of someone aboard the frigate meant the _first_ Marion Island mail was not _left_ unmarked.
This first handstamp bears the commanding officer's block cachet dated _29th December 1947__ (the date of landing at Marion). This covers rear also shows
a large circular rubber stamp commemorating its place of preparation. The circular cachet is also found a a cancellation-type strike
on the front of at least __one__ cover.

The cover shown in [figure 1](introduction#figure_1).

One of Crawford's numerous official duties in his capacity as senior civil servant or " Governor" of the Prince Edwards was to act as postmaster. He had brought no stock of stamps, and he had no equipment for the office except a rubber stamp bearing the words: "Marion Island, South Indian Ocean." He had had it made three years previously, along with others for Tristan and Gough, when the proposal to establish meteorological stations on the three islands was being considered, and he anticipated that he might be sent to one of them. Actually he was sent to Tristan, but he kept the stamps for the others in case he might find use for them one day.

I gave him his first official task even before he landed but after he had entered the territorial waters of the Prince Edwards. While we talked he rubber-stamped for me a handful of letters, dating them and signing them "Allan B. Crawford, Acting Postmaster." Before he reached the shore they were on their way to the Union as Marion Island's first official mail, and they were duly posted in Cape Town and delivered through the normal channel. Already they have become philatelic treasures.



###Arrival of Allan Crawford

The \ship{Good Hope}  arrived on january 28, 1948. This marked a watershed in Marion Island's postal history. It brought 
Allan Crawford, who was to serve as the first meteorologist, first officer in charge of the station - and its first postmaster.

Allan Crawford served on marion Island during the construction phase (with its active ship traffic and 30-40 onshore 
personnel). He and nine othe rmembers of the inaugaral staff were relived on 28th August 1948, leaving aboard the minesweeper
_Bloemfontein_. These ten had remained alone on Marion Island when the construction party 
left aboard _Natal_, 20 March 1948.
