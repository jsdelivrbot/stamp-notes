# The Land Post Stamps

In 1850 a rural post was established
in Baden, its chief object being to operate
a messenger service connecting rural
villages which had no post-offices of
their own with the nearest State Postoffice.
It had an organisation of its
own, distinct from the State Post, but
to which, nevertheless, it was an adjunct.

In the year 1862 a Grand Ducal
decree was issued, under the date of
26th September, authorising improvements
in connection with this rural post
and Ikr, 3kr, and 12kr stamps were ordered
to be prepared for its use. These
stamps are of similar design showing
large numerals in the centre with
"LAXD-POST" above and "PORTOMARKE"
below. An ornamental border
completed this very unpretentious
design. All were printed in black on
yellow wove paper and perforated 10.
The inscription "Porto-marke" indicates
they were postage due stamps but
they were not postage due stamps in
the ordinary meaning of the term.

These labels were used solely in connection
with the rural post and in addition
to being used to collect deficient
postage, they were used to collect the
delivery charge on parcels, and for various
purposes such as the collection and
conveyance of money. At this period the
Post-office collected taxes and, in some
instances, debts due to tradesmen. For
this service it charged a commission
fixed at the rate of Ikr per florin and
this commission was denoted by means
of these rural post stamps. The stamps
were not sold to the public but were
used only by officers of the rural post.
The stamps are scarce used, especially
the 12kr but they are common enough
unused owing to the fact that in 1873
Julius Goldner, of Hamburg, purchased
the remainders consisting of 322,800 of
the Ikr, 455,400 of the 3kr and 160,000
of the 12kr.
