# 1860-63 Third Issue

After the last printing of the numeral
stamps, which took place in 1859, the
electrotypes had become so worn that
it was evident new sets would have to
be made for all values before further
printing could take place. The neighbouring
kingdom of Wurtemberg had
adopted a new design showing the
Arms of the State and as other
countries were contemplating the
adoption of more elaborate designs it
is hardly surprising that the Baden Government was also considering the
advisability of replacing its plain numeral
stamps with something more
striking. As new plates were required
anyway the time was opportune for a
change. 


In an excellent article appearing
in the Philatelic Record for 1894
we read
The Postal Administration sent in
its report to the Government of the
Grand Duchy on 21st June, 1859, setting
forth the necessity of having
fresh plates provided for printing
the stamps, as those in use were worn
out, and that the question had arisen
whether the design should not be
changed; that the present design was
antiquated; that the printing on colored
paper was not clear, nor were
the stamps safe from imitation; that
it would be better that the stamps
should be printed on white paper in
colors according to their values, and,
as was then done elsewhere, the
country should be denoted by the
head of its Sovereign or its Arms ;
and that in order to render the
stamps perfect, secure from imitation,
and their separation readier, they
should be perforated as in England
and France.

The report was approved by the Ministry
and on June 29th, 1859 the Postal
administration was authorised to obtain
the necessary dies for the new issue;
to purchase white paper for printing
the stamps; "to furnish the outer edges
of the stamps with perforation, so as
to facilitate their separation," and not
to print any more stamps in the old
designs but to use up all existing
supplies.

From motives of economy it was decided
to join with Wurtemberg in the
purchase of a perforating machine.
This was obtained from Vienna at a
cost of 1200 florins ($480.00) and set up
at Carlsruhe for the joint use of both
States.

Immediate steps were taken to procure
suitable dies for the new issue
and a specification detailing what was
required was sent to two engravers
Ludwig Kurz, of Frankfort, and Friederich
Eckard, of Carlsruhe. According
to this specification the design was to
be a square of 7 l/2 Baden lines, or 23 1/2
mm., there was to be one original die
on steel or copper for each value, and
from each of these 110 electrotypes
were to be made "of the thickness of
a Baden copper kreutzer" and mounted
on metal. It was stipulated that proofs
should be sent and that the engraving
should be corrected if required. The
engravers were desired to specify the
price at which they would undertake
the work. With each specification a
carefully executed drawing of the proposed
design in Indian ink was enclosed.
Quoting from the article in the
Philatelic Record again we read
The engraver Eckard declined to
undertake the order under the conditions,'
but on the 15th July, Ludwig
Kurz, of Frankfort, offered to undertake
the work at the price of 10
florins for each die, and 48kr for
each of the 110 electro-casts of each
value. The cost of the whole would
therefore be 392 florins ($156.80).

The order was given to Kurz on 24th
August, 1859, and in October following
he sent in a proof of the 3kr
stamp. Some alterations were ordered
to be made, and on 8th November
he was informed that he might proceed
with the other original dies.
On the 23rd November he sent proofs
of the 1, 3, 6, and 9kr, and he then
proceeded with the electro-casts,
which he delivered by the 23rd December
111 of each value, except that
of the 3kr, of which he delivered 110.
Kurz states that he engraved the
original dies on copper in relief with
the aid of aquafortis and that the drawing
from which he worked was furnished
by Herr Klimsch, of Frankfort.

The design shows the Arms of Baden with supporters within a square frame on a horizontally lined ground. In the upper border "BADEN" is shown; in the lower "KREUZER" preceded by a
numeral appears ; at the left reading upwards is "FREIMARKE" (Free stamp) ; and at the right reading downwards is "POSTVEREIN" (PostalUnion). All the inscriptions are in uncolored Egyptia n capitals on a solid ground, and the angles are filled with
rosaces. The plates consisted of 100 electrotypes arranged in ten horizontal
rows of ten, the extra cliches being held in reserve in case any of the others became worn or damaged.




In February, 1860, the printer, Hasper,
was asked to submit color trials of
the various denominations. This order
he complied with and, as they were not
approved, he submitted further ones
later on. On March 22nd, he was informed
informed
that the following colors had
been chosen: "For the Ikr, good English
black printer's ink; for the 3kr,
Berlin blue; for the 6kr, dark chrome
yellow; and for the 9kr, light Munich
cochineal lake. He was directed to
make special efforts to keep the tints
in the various printings quite uniform
an order to which he paid no particular
attention. Plain white wove paper
was used for this issue and, the question
of gumming being under consideration,
half of the first supply was gummed
with an Austrian adhesive matter made
of bone-glue, and the other half was
gummed with the mucilage used in Saxony
a mixture of Syriac gum and
glycerine. The latter was found the
most satisfactory and it was used for
all subsequent supplies. The perforating
machine gave a gauge of 13 l/2 and
was so constructed that an entire sheet
of 100 stamps could be perforated at
once.

The 1kr and 3kr were the first values
to be printed and these appear to have
been in use as early as June 1860,
though the catalogues give the date of
issue as 1861. As there were large
stocks of the old 6kr and 9kr numeral
stamps, which it was decided to use up,
the corresponding values of the Arms
type were not in use until fairly late
in 1861 while they were not in general
circulation throughout the grand-duchy
until the following year. There were
several printings of all values resulting
in several strikingly different shades for
the 3kr and 6kr. Of the former a printing
in Prussian blue is distinctly rare
unused.

In 1862 the perforating machine was
overhauled and fitted with a new set
of punches which gave a gauge of 10
in place of the previous IS 1
. The exact
date at which this took place is not
known but it was sometime between
March and June. Supplies of all stamps
printed in June or later are, therefore,
perforated 10.

In March 1861 the Prussian Postal
Administration addressed a circular to
the various States forming the German
Austrian Postal Union proposing that
uniform colors should be adopted for
stamps of the same or corresponding
values. This applied only to the stamps
in use for the three rates of postage
equivalent to 1, 2, and 3sgr, and so far
as Baden was concerned this affected
all but the Ikr. The colors decided on
were rose for the 3kr, blue for the 6kr,
and brown for the 9kr. Baden agreed
to the proposition which came into effect
just prior to the alteration of the
gauge of the perforating machine.


About this period, too, some modification of the design was under discussion.
Following the many changes round
about this date in strict chronological
order is likely to result in confusion
and it will, therefore, be simpler to
deal, first of all, with the changes as
they affected the stamps of the type
with lined background. None of the
3kr stamps in the new rose color were
printed in this type for reasons we shall
detail later on. Although supplies of
the 6kr and 9kr in the new colors of
blue and brown respectively were ordered
in December 1861, none appear
to have been delivered until the summer
of 1862. 

Notwithstanding this
fact an official notification of the change
of colors was made to postmasters on
Jan. 29th, 1862, and this has thus
(though erroneously) been frequently
stated as the date of issue. As a matter
of fact the 6kr could not have been
used earlier than August, 1862, while
the 9kr does not appear to have been
in general circulation until the following
year.
