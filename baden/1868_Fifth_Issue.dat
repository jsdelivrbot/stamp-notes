# 1868 Fifth Issue

At the end of 1867 the North German
Postal Confederation, which was then
formed, established a new scale of rates
to take effect from January 1st, 1868.
The rate on letters weighing under *4 oz.
was fixed at 3kr and that on heavier
letters up to l/2 oz. at 7kr. The latter
rate also applied to letters sent to
Switzerland, Belgium, and North
America by way of Prussia, and later
on it was extended to other foreign
countries. The necessity of creating a
new stamp of 7kr was at once apparent.

The Baden Post Office in recommending
the issue of this new value at the
same time suggested the withdrawal of
the 18kr value and reported that there
was sufficient stock on hand of the 6kr,
9kr, and 30kr to last for years. The
stock of the 18kr was, therefore, withdrawn
and destroyed as we have already
stated. It was decided to issue a 7kr
stamp as recommended and Maier an
engraver of Carlsruhe was entrusted
with the task of preparing the die. As
the inscription "POSTVEREIN" on
the right-hand side of the frame, no
longer applied, the word "FREIMARKE"
was subsituted.

It will be
noted that the inscriptions are in thicker
type than before (especially as regards
"BADEN") and the value at foot is
contracted to "KR". The work is altogether
much inferior to that of Kurz.
At the same time it was decided to
alter the designs of the Ikr and 3kr to
correspond with the new 7kr. It would
appear that Maier only engraved one
matrix, with the numerals of value
omitted, and from this the three secondary
dies required were constructed.
Although the new rates were effective
as and from January 1st, 1868, the 7kr
stamps were not ready for issue until
October and the modified Ikr and 3kr
were issued about the same time. An
official notice, dated September 1868,
was circulated to the post-masters intimating
them of the change of design,
viz :

A printing of three sorts of stamps
from a new die will be ready this year.
These are the stamps of 1 and 3 kreuzer,
and a new value of 7 kreuzer.
The design is the same as before, except
that the word FREIMARKE is
repeated in the right side of the frame,
in place of POSTVEREIN as heretofore.
The value is indicated by a
numeral, and the letters KR.

The colours of the new issue are
1 kreuzer green, 3 kreuzer red, as
before, and the 7 kreuzer blue, but
of a darker tone than the present 6
kreuzer stamp. The delivery of the
new 1 kreuzer stamp to the Postoffices
has. already begun, and that of
the 3 kreuzer will follow as soon as
the old stamps in the chief depots
have been exhausted. The delivery of
thej kreuzer stamps will follow at the
beginning of the next quarter, and, unless
otherwise ordered, in the quantities
necessary for each of the Grand
Ducal Post-offices.
There were further printings of these
stamps in the years 1869, 1870, and 1871.
On December 31st of the latter year
the Postal Administration of Baden
ceased to exist as a separate institution,
and on January 1st, 1872, its stamps
were superseded by those of the German
-Empire.
