# 1854-58 Second Postage Stamp Issue

Another printing of the stamps of the
numeral type took place in 1853. The
color of the Ikr not being considered
satisfactory it was decided to print this
value on plain white paper. At the
same time, to reduce the cost of production,
fifty additional cliches were
made so that this value could be printed
in sheets of 100 like the others of the
series. In this printing, also, the 3kr
and 6kr exchanged colors though for
what reason is not clear unless there
was some idea that these values might
be confused with the similar denominations
for the kingdom of Wurtemberg.
No public notice of the change
of colors was given but the information
was conveyed to the post-offices in a
general order dated June 3rd, 1853, as
follows :

You are hereby informed of a new
impression of the postage stamps
which will be sent you in a few days
from the Grand Ducal General Postoffice,
in which the colours are
changed, for the 6kr yellow, for the
3kr green, and white for the Ikr. All the Postoffices are informed of these
changes, in order to render mistakes
impossible. The new stamps are
not to be sold to the public till the
stock of the old ones is entirely
exhausted.

From this notice it is plain that the
new stamps could not have been issued
prior to June 3rd, 1853 and as a matter
of fact none of the values were used
until 1854. The Ikr was issued in January
of that year while the other
values were placed on sale in the following
month.

Description
6 Kr., Plattenfehler nach Baden-Hb. "1 / 29" (zweimal Kerbe über 185o am rechten Rand), ringsum breitrand. geschnittenes Exemplar in leuchtend frischer Farbe, ungebraucht mit Resten des Originalgummis. Dieser Plattenfehler ist schon auf gebrauchten Exemplaren nahezu unauffindbar, auf einer ungebrauchten Marke, vor allem in so schöner Erhaltung ein Unikat. Fotoattest Flemming BPP ("Sehr selten, das erste mir bekannte Stück auf einer ungebrauchten Marke!" Württembergisches Auktionshaus 126th Auction, December 12th, 2015 EUR 750
6 Kr., plate flaw to Baden-Hb. "1 / 29" (twice notch over 1850 at the right margin), large margins all around cut copy in illuminating fresh colour, unused with remainders of the original gum. This plate flaw is already on second-hand copies nearly untraceably, on an unused stamp, in particular in so nice condition is unique. Certificate with photograph Flemming BPP ("very rare, the first known piece on an unused stamp!") }

Later printings were made in 1854,
1855, and 1857 the colors remaining the
same. Before the printing of 1857
took place complaint was made of the
difficulty experienced in gumming the
3kr value. The manufacturers attributed
this difficulty to the color of the
paper and recommended paper of a new
tint be used, blue being the color suggested.
As, however, a large quantity
of the green paper remained in stock
and the paper maker would only take
this back as "waste" it was decided to
use this up before making any change.

In 1858 another printing was made
and the suggested change of color then
took place. No notice of this change
of paper to either public or officials has
been found but from a study of dated
specimens it seems proved that the blue
3kr was issued in December, 1858.
All four varieties were reprinted in
1867 and, like the reprints of the 1851
issue made at the same time, their detection
is a difficult matter only possible
to one who has made a special study
of the stamps. The paper of the Ikr
and 3kr is thicker than that used for
the originals, the shades of all four
are slightly different, and the gum is
white and smooth.
