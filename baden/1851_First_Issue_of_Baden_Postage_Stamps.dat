# 1851 Baden First Issue of Postage Stamps


On April 6th, 1850, the governments of Austria and Prussia established a Postal Convention for the interchange of correspondence at fixed rates and other German States were invited to join the Union. Among other things the Articles of this Convention stipulated
that, as a rule, correspondence should be prepaid and that such prepayment should be effected by means of postage stamps as soon as practicable.
Baden at once agreed to join the Union but as the sanction of the Legislative Assembly was necessary before the grand-duchy could officially become a member matters were delayed until the meeting of that body in the autumn of 1850. The Legislative Assembly gave its consent and also sanctioned the issue of postage stamps. In the meantime enquiries had been made regarding the safest and most economical method of manufacturing stamps so that directly legal enactment was given to the recommendation to join the Union, the authorities were in a position to proceed with the manufacture of suitable labels. It was decided to issue four values 1kr, 3kr, 6kr, and 9kr and Mr.C. Naumann, of Frankfort, was commissioned
to engrave the dies while the paper was obtained from a local papermaker.

It was decided that the most economical method would be to print all values in black but use paper of a different color for each. Mr. Westoby states that "the dies were engraved on copper in relief,- and consistedd of two parts: the numeral of the value; was in the
centre on,a circular ground, the pattern of which varied with each value; while the rectangular, frame: was the same for all the values.

At the top we find "Baden" in German capitals; at the bottom is "Freimarke",
meaning "Free stamp"; at the left is "Deutsch: Oestr : Postverein", signifying
"German Austrian Postal Union"; and at the right is "Vertrag v. 6 April, 1850", meaning "Convention of April 6th, 1850". The latter date, as already
explained, refers to that on which the Postal Union was established.

The dies for the four values were
completed by Naumann on Dec. 20th,
1850, and 100 electrotypes were taken
from each of them, except of the Ikr
of which only fifty electros were cast.
It was decided to print the Ikr in
sheets of 45, in five rows of nine, and
the other values in sheets of 90, in ten
rows of nine. The extra cliches were
kept in reserve in case any of the others
should become damaged or worn and
have to be replaced. The paper was
machine-made, wove, and differed in
color for each value. The paper for
the Ikr was buff; that for the 3kr was
orange; that for the 6kr bluish green;
and that for the 9kr was rose-red
showing a faint tinge of violet. The
stamps were imperforate.

The stamps were printed by the
University printer, Mr. Hasper, of
Carlsruhe, ordinary black printers' ink
being employed. By the end of February,
1851, a supply considered sufficient
to last a year was ready but for some
reason or other the stamps were not
placed in issue until May 1st. The demand
for stamps being much greater
than had been anticipated the first supply
was exhausted in less than three
months and a further supply had to be
printed. This second impression was
ready in August and the paper used
for the 3kr and 6kr differed in tint
from that originally used. The color
of that for the 3kr was yellow and that
for the 6kr yellow-green. The plates
differed also, the reserve cliches being
added, so that the Ikr was printed in

sheets of fifty and the other values in
sheets of one hundred. The additional
electrotypes were so added that the
horizontal rows contained ten instead
of nine specimens.

A well authenticated error of the 9kr
is known this being printed on the
bluish green paper of the 6kr. It is
an exceedingly rare stamp and it is presumed
that only one sheet was printed.

Reprints of the 1kr, 3kr, and 6kr
were made in 1867 and, except to an
expert, these are very difficult to distinguish
from originals. The shades
differ slightly, the paper for the 1kr
and 3kr is thicker and the gum is white
and smooth instead of being brown and
crackly like the gum on the originals. Care should, therefore, be exercised in the purchase of unused specimens.
