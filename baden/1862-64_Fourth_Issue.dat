# 1862-64 Fourth Issue

After the printing of the 3kr stamps
in June 1861 it was found that, although
little more than 60,000 sheets had been
supplied from first to last, the cliches
had become too badly worn to be of
further use. As a new set was necessary
advantage was taken of this fact
to ascertain whether a modification of
the design would not improve the appearance
of the stamps. Kurz was supplied
with two of the cliches to see
what he could do and from one of these
he removed every alternate line of the
background and from the other he
erased the lines entirely so that the
Arms stood out on a plain rectangle.

The latter was considered such an improvement
that the original dies of all
four values were returned to Kurz for
attention. The renovated dies were
ready for use early in August 1861 but
as only the 3kr was immediately necessary
Hasper was instructed to prepare
110 cliches for the new plate for this
denomination. A first printing of the
3kr in the new type was ordered late
in 1861 and a first delivery of 2000
sheets was made in March 1862. These
stamps arrived at the period when the
overhauling of the perforating machine
had been decided on but there was such
urgent need for 3kr stamps that this
supply was perforated before the new
punches were fitted. We thus find the
3kr of this issue perforated 13 1/2 as
well as 10 like the other values. With
the 13 1/2 gauge the stamp is quite a
rarity unused and fairly scarce used.
We have already referred to the fact
that the dies for the Ikr, 6kr and 9kr
had the background removed in 1861
but it was not until the close of the year
1863 that Hasper found it necessary to
construct plates from the altered dies.

He now made 110 cliches of each value
.to be ready for the printing of 1864
though none of the new 6kr were delivered
until April of that year while
the Ikr and 9kr were not supplied until
June. On the 17th of June, 1864,
a circular was sent to the various postoffices
stating that the new postage
stamps of 6 and 9 kreuzer, with plain
background, would be supplied from the
General Post Store in the next quarter,
and the Ikr stamps of similar design
in the following quarter. From this
order it is evident the 6kr and 9kr could
not have been in use prior to July or
the Ikr until October 1864. Other printings
took place later on and as the
printer apparently made no special endeavor
to keep the colors of the printing
inks uniform quite a wide range of
shades may be found in all except the
Ikr denomination. Of these the rarest
is the 6kr in a Prussian blue like that
of the similar tint found in connection
with the 3kr of the preceding issue.
The 3kr is known imperforate while
the 9kr in the bistre shade has been
found printed on both sides.


We now retrace our steps a little to
1861 when the alteration of design and
change of colors was under discussion.
In the same year a desire was expressed
for stamps of a higher value than 9kr,
the first step being taken by the Chamber
of Commerce of Mannheim, who
proposed to the Baden Ministry of
Commerce that 18kr and 30kr stamps
should be created. Although the use of
the then current 12kr and 18kr envelopes
had been very restricted the
Ministry decided to introduce 18kr and
30kr labels and Kurz was commissioned
to supply the necessary dies for these
values. The dies, which were in the
design with plain background, were delivered
on October, 28th, 1861, and Hasper
at once proceeded to make the
cliches for the printing plates. 


The colors decided on were green for the
18kr and cinnabar-red for the 30kr.
After a small number of sheets of the
higher value had been printed Hasper
reported that "the cinnabar-red was not
fit for printing from galvano-plastic
plates, as the quicksilver acted injuriously
on the copper." He was consequently
ordered to print this value in
orange for the future. Whether the
stamps in cinnabar-red were placed in
use or not is not certain. Westoby
lists it as haying been issued and if
his statement is correct the stamps in
this color must be of extreme rarity.
Other printings were made from time
to time though neither of the values
seems to have been in very great demand.
The total quantity of 18kr printed
was 315,200 and of these 151,012 were destroyed
in July, 1870 as the new postal
rates made the value absolutely useless.
The total supply of the 30kr stamps
numbered 430,400 and though comparatively
few were used, and the stamp
is rare in this condition, it is common
enough unused as the remainders were
sold to a dealer some years later.
