\chapter{Alderney} 

Alderney was known as Aurigny in Norman times, and is still known as such in France. In fact the small local airline bears the ancient Norman name, although it is believed that the planes are from a more modern era.

The Island has never issued it's own postage stamps or indeed had its own postal administration; but many stamps have been issued using the Alderney name or on its behalf. As with Jersey and Guernsey, British postage stamps were used from 1840 until 1969 with the exception of the German Occupation years.

Revenue stamps were the first stamps, not for postage, but for stamp duty, tax, etc. They were in use from January 1923 until 1st April 1962.



Early letters to and from Alderney were carried privately as and when ships  or boats called at the Island until a Post Office was formally opened by the GPO on Alderney under  Guernsey by the 16th March 1848 following considerable debate and appeals to the Postmaster General in London.  \footnote{Not in 1843 as previously thought by some authors.}

John Tilbury was appointed as the Receiver and an undated double arc handstamp was issued for use. This was quickly followed by a numeral obliterator with the Post Office number 965 and then the first datestamp in 1851 and a double arc datestamps with ALDERNEY around the top and code letters  A and C  later in the 1850s.

Throughout the 19th century various sub-types of these handstamps were issued for several purposes such as the introduction of Money Orders, Postal Orders, the appointment of Alderney as a Telegraph office and the introduction of the Parcel Post Service. This led to the issue of several types of Parcel Post label and further datestamps and handstamps in the 1900s to meet an ever changing number of requirements.

Registration facilities were available from the mid-1800s at Alderney and the earliest registration label known from Alderney was a "D" type label used in 1910. Other types followed from then.

\subsection{Modern Stamps}
Guernsey and Alderney Stamps are world renowned for their beauty and quality.[5] The first Guernsey Postage Stamps were designed and printed in 1941. 

Over the years many aspects of island life have been commemorated and depicted on Guernsey and Alderney stamps. Topics of past philatelic issues include the sea, the natural world, agriculture and horticulture, transport, sport, Christmas, military, art and entertainment. Guernsey Stamps are produced by Guernsey Post.

The Commodore Shipping Company Ltd. carried GPO mail by boat between Alderney and Guernsey between 1962 and 30th September 1969. They also ran a parcel delivery service by arrangement with The States of Alderney and The Government of Sark.The company issued stamps or carriage labels which were used for this; these issues consisted of a definitive set and a Europa set and from 1964 minisheets were introduced.

Although some were genuinely used for the carriage of parcels, the fact that from the 1964 Europa issue onwards the printing came under the control of a London wholesale stamp dealer and the large number of similar issues, great number of varieties, errors, imperf sets, trials, proofs and overprints make it seem that these were issued purely for the philatelic market.

On 1st October 1969 The Alderney Shipping Company took over the parcel delivery service, issuing just two typeset labels. These were withdrawn in 1975.

The Alderney Parcel Delivery Service was set up in 1974 for the carriage of parcels to and from the island. Stamps first issued in that year used a combination of rubber stamps, typewritten and printed items, with pictorials available in 1975. In 1984 issues ceased after Alderney issued its own postage stamps. Delivery services continued and in 1990 issues resumed and still continue today.

Other issues include Balloon Race labels. Regan's Post, States of Alderney Local Post, 1991 Alderney Week Labels and Raz Island labels, all short lived issues of no postal validity.
