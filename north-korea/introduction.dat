History


The first stamps of North Korea were issued on 12 March 1946.[3] Stamps prior to 1974 dealt primarily with subjects relating specifically to North Korea, its foundation, Kim Il-Sung and other patriotic themes. After 1974, in a bid to bring more hard currency into the country, North Korea began issuing stamps with wide-ranging themes (such as Joan of Arc, airships, sports and wildlife) and using English descriptions.[4]
Wording on the stamps is mostly in Korean. The term "DPR Korea" is written in English.
