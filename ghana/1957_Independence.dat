# 1957 Independence
The first stamps of independent Ghana were issued in March 1957[1] and consisted of a commemorative stamp set of four and a definitive stamp series of 12 formed by overprinting former Gold Coast stamps with the words GHANA INDEPENDENCE 6th MARCH 1957.[2] Regular issues have followed, including a number of sets of postage due stamps.

Although the stamps are simple in design and of very little interest to philatelists, the story behind them is interesting. In the autumn of 1955, as Gold Coast independence was considered by Whitehall, Gold Coast Government officials considered the issue of the new nation's first postage stamps. The first order of business was to identify and commission an advisory board of government and private sector professionals to comprise the membership of a new Postage Stamps Committee. 

As it was the Postage Stamps Committee of the soon-to-be-independent Gold Coast recommended that the image of the `historical character' of Kwame Nkrumah be placed on the very first independence commemoration stamps.
