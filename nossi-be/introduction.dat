\chapter{Nossi Be}

NOSSI BE, otherwise Great Island, off the coast of [Madagascar](../madagascar/Introduction), has, as its capital, the
town of Helleville called after De Hell who was Governor at the time of the French annexation.
My cover shows the handstamp of Helleville clearly struck in blue, dated 1905,
together with that of the steamship line La Reunion Marseilles. Helleville was a port of
call for Messageries Maritimes. The other exhibit from Nossi Be may, I think, call for an
apology as it looks rather too ready-made. However, it may be alright and it was the Sea
Post Office handstamp which tempted me to buy it.\cite{LP0943}
