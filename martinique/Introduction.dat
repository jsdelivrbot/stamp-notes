## Martinique
Martinique (French pronunciation: ​[maʁtinik]) is an island in the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean Sea, with a land area of 1,128 km2 (436 sq mi). Like [Guadeloupe](../guadeloupe/introduction), it is an overseas region of France, consisting of a single overseas department. It is directly north of [St. Lucia](../st-lucia/Introduction) and south of [Dominica](../dominica/Introduction).

As with the other overseas departments, Martinique is one of the twenty-seven regions of France (being an overseas region) and an integral part of the French Republic. As part of France, Martinique is part of the European Union, and its currency is the Euro. Its official language is French, although many of its inhabitants also speak Antillean Creole (Créole Martiniquais).
