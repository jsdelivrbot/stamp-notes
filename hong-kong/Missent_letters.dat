###Hong Kong: Missent Letters

The first air mail from Hong Kong took place on 4 November 1932. This was a purely experimental flight and on account of short notice only carried a very limited mail. The mail was flown to marseilles, and then taken by surface mail to London, To mark this event, stamps on letters carried were cancelled with an ordinary datestamp applied in red instead of the customary black (Type 11).
