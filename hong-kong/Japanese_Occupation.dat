###Hong Kong: Japanese Occupation
The surrrender of the Colony to the Japanese  took place at 3.30 pm on Christmas day, 1941. Subsequent the conditions were chaotic for there was no regular mail until the 22 February, 1942 when the two main offices at Victoria and Kowloon, together with two unspecified branch offices, were opened for business.

##Japanese Surrender 1945

Japan surrendered at midnight on August 14, 1945, and the re-establishment of the British postal service of Hong Kong provides much material of interest, especially in the form of Handstruck Postage Stamps. At first all mail was marked with a large octagonal handstamp or chop, 38mm x 38mm with the inscription <span style="font-size:smaller">HONG KONG POSTAGE PAID</span>. It is not certain when the handstamp was firstly used but Lobdell and Hopkins report that it appears from enclosures that it was firstly used on 29 August, 1945. It continued to be used until adhesive postage stamps were re-issued on 28 September, 1945 and 1 October at Kowloon.

A first day cover has the datestamp VICTORIA HONG KONG 2.30 28 SP 45. 

Navy markings were also employed at this time and provide much interest. A good deal of the mail in the year after the Liberation seems to have been delivered via Naval channels. Covers exist with british adhesives that have been used on official mail.

Lobdell reports FPO No. 222 in June 1946 and also others are know (see above).




### Royal Air Force

The Royal Air Force (RAF) had their own organization. This used datestamps of the Indian style and three variations are known.

### Newspaper paid stamps

In July, 1946, there was in use a double ringed handstruck postage stamp of 5 cents denomination. This was struck in red and it was reported seen on newspaper wrappers emanating from the offices of the _The South China Morning Post_ and the _Hong Kong Telegraph_. All show Calcutta arrival markings of 25 August 1945. Lobdell and Hopkins speculate that as there were no regular shiplines established they all travelled in one ship.

The offices that were re-opened after the Liberation were: Hong Kong G.P.O., Sheungwan and Wantsai, on the island of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Yaumati and Shamshui Po in the Kowloon Peninsula, and Cheung Chau, Tai Po and Un Long in the New Territories a total of nine post offices.

The markings are all indicated by alphanumeric numbers as Type L1-L7.
