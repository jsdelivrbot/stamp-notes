\chapter{Amoy}

The original Consular Post Office was opened in 1844 and closed November 30th 1922. There were two British Post Offices, on Ku Lang Seu and teh mainland respectively. This accounts for Amy having two killers and two varieties of Lobdell Type 6 postmark.

Dr. A.M.T. Cheung's listing of Royal Arms covers shows only two later covers from Koolunsoo to London, but does not list this earliest Amoy-origin example. The British consulate and consular postal agency were set up in 1844, according to Proud, with the consular post office coming into force from the receipt of the 20 April 1844 circular dispatch from the Superintendant of Trade at Hong Kong.
