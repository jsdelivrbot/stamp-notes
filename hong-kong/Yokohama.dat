\chapter{Yokohama}

The Post Office, called a Packet Agency, was  first established in 1859, at the Consulate at {{wi: Kanagawa}}, but after a few months moved, with the Consulate and British Colony, to the adjacent village of Yokohama.

It was ordered to use stamps by the Postmaster General of Hong Kong on August 188, 1864, and Hong Kong stamps were issued to the public on the following October 15th.

The postal work was so heavy that the office was removed from teh British Consulate, and a regular branch of the Hong Kong Post Office was opened at Yokohma on July 20th, 1867, Mr. John Simpson was appointed as Postmaster.

In 1868 Japan established her own Post Office, and in 1875 a Foreign Department for overseas mail.

Further there were Fench and American Post Offices in Yokohama. The much quicker mails to Europe via San Francisco, with cheaper rates of postage, made the American Post Office a favourite. Between 1875 and 1878 the British Postal revenu decreased by two thirds, with a drop of ten thousand dollars.

In accordance with the terms of a Postal Convention with Japan, the British Post Office at Yokohama was closed on 31st Dec 1879, and the building left to fall to pieces.
