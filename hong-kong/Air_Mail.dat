###Hong Kong: Airmail
These series of articles are based on personal research through auction catalogues, books and exhibitors. The first published source of information on the air mail service originated in Lobdell and Hopkins. However this is fairly incomplete and does not cover well the first experimental flights and associated air mail areas, such as disaster mail.

The first air mail to Hong Kong was from the experimental flight in 1925 from England.

###August 1924, Summer Air Service, London - Moscow
In late August 1924 British airmail was first accepted for Hong Kong. It was first carried by Imperial Airways to Berlin and then by Deutsche Russiche Luftverkehregesellsschaft, usually known as Deruluft, to Moscow, from where it was transported by the Trans-Siberian railway to Manchouli, by rail to Shanghai, and then by sea to Hong Kong. This service was only available in the summer, being suspended in the winter due to the weather.

###17 October 1925 De Pinedo Flight
On 21 April 1925 Major Francesco de Pinedo of the Italian Royal Air Force, accompanied by a mechanic, Ernesto Campanelli left Rome in a naval Savoia S16 hydroplane named _Gennariello_. He crossed southern Europe and Asia on his way to Sydney. Then he flew to Shanghai, skirting the East Indies, Philippines and Formosa. From Shanghai
he went via Korea to Kagoshima and then onto Tokyo. On his return trip he left Tokyo on 16 october, arriving in Shaghai on the 18th. Permission was obtained to carry mail for Hong Kong and Rome. This mail was posted at the nanking Post Office on the 17th and would have reached Shanghai the following morning in time for de pinedo's departure. However, on the day it was posted the troops at Chekiang Province cut the railway at several points in an attempt to cut off the retreat of those from Fengtien Province. Consequently, the mail had to be carried by steamer to 
Shanghai, which meant it arrived on the 20th. However, on the 19th, de Pinedo had to leave Shanghai without this mail, arriving back in Rome in his original plane, after a flight of 36,000 miles on, 8 November 1925.

De Pinedo pioneered a number of other flights and was killed while taking off in a Bellanca monoplane on September 2, 1933, reportedly preparing to start a record length flight from New York City to Baghdad. One has to appreciate the risks these pioneers were taking and to respect these covers reminding us of these early days of long distance aviation. the tragic last flight was captured on film and you can view it at [Pinedo's Last Flight](http://youtu.be/9gpB9KLd9Bc).



###18 November 1928, Royal Air Force Far East Flight

Thei main purpose was to survey landing sites for the route to Autsralia. This mail carried the first official despatch for Hong Kong, which comprised covers from manila and Cabugao. To commemorate the arrival of this squadron in   Philippines stamps overprinted with a red flying boat and the initials "L.O.F." standing for "London Orient Flight" were issued.

##Outbound Flights

The first air mail from Hong Kong took place on 4 November 1932. This was a purely experimental flight and on account of short notice only carried a very limited mail. The mail was flown to Marseilles, and then taken by surface mail to London. To mark this event, stamps on letters carried were cancelled with an ordinary datestamp applied in red instead of the customary black (Type 11).
