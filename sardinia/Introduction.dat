\chapter{Sardinia}

WHEN I started to collect the stamps of Sardinia, I was surprised to learn that Sardinia
was not just an island, but consisted of a large portion of Italy which included the Island
of Sardinia. The territory of the Kingdom of Sardinia was settled in 1815, at the Treaty
of Vienna, and it remained so until 1859. It consisted of the north-west part of what is
now known as Italy and the Territory- of Nice. In June 1.859, France and Italy combined
against, and defeated, Austria in the Franco-Piedmontese War, which was ended by the
Treaty of Villafranca. By this Treaty, Austria ceded Lombardy to Sardinia and Sardinia
ceded her territory of Nice to France, i.e. the Provinces of Savoy, Annecy, Chambery
and Nice.

\section{The First Issue, 1851}

The Kingdom of Sardinia issued its first stamps in January 1851. These were of three
values, 5c., 20c., and 40c. They were lithographed on thick, smooth white paper and
consisted of sheets of 50 stamps made up of two groups of 25 each. Some say that they
were printed in sheets of 100 consisting of four groups of 25 stamps each.
There are two "secret" marks on all three values, namely the pearl above the "x" of
"POSTE" and the seventh pearl counting up from the bottom right corner. These two pearls
are white and have no colour in them.

The design of these stamps consists of an oval containing a portrait of King Victor
Emmanuel II surrounded by the words "FRANCO BOLLO POSTE (val.) c (val.)." It is interesting to note that this design persisted through all the four Sardinian issues and for the first provisional issue of the Kingdom of Italy.

The usual postmark of the first issue was a rectangle made up of a number of diamonds.
For a few months some of the larger post offices were issued with a special postmark in
the form of the knot of love of the House of Savoy, also known as the Savoy Knot. This
can be found singly or sometimes repeated two or three times. It was generally stamped in
black and rarely in red. I have one 5c. with the cancellation in red. It was supposed to be discontinued after a few months of use, but I have an entire dated March 1854 with the
Savoy Knot cancellation, which means it was in use at least three years.

An uncommon postmark is the "Asti grid." I have this on an entire from Asti to Valenza.
It consists of a rectangle of crossed lines. It will be observed that this postmark is minus the date of the year. Red and blue postmarks are uncommon but not, on the whole, hard to come by.

5c.—The first printing can be told by the depth of the colour (though I believe black is
really not a colour at all), and the full details of the beard and hair. There is one interesting
piece to which I would draw attention. This is a single 40c. used with a pair of the 5c.
showing the "squeezed u" variety. I have seen another example of this so I consider this a
definite variety.

20c.—Beside the first printing there were five specific transfers. Of these the second,
third and fourth are the most common. The fifth is by far the most rare and I have not so
far obtained a specimen. These transfers can be distinguished by various very small marks.
The first printing is distinguished, as one would expect, by the completeness of the details
of the design and of the hair and beard. It has also some distinguishing marks, for example,
a small white mark after the "E" of "VENTI"; these, however, seem, as a rule, conspicuous
by their absence, which makes this particular printing rather hard to distinguish. In the
three common transfers there are certain signs which are constant and regular. The
difficulty, however, in perceiving these marks is usually caused by the heaviness of the
postmark.

40c.—I have already stated that the stones of all values are made up of two or four
groups of 25 stamps each. Pairs, strips and blocks of the 40c. are scarce. Obviously it is
possible to obtain in a pair or strip two stamps from consecutive groups. In such cases
there is a larger gutter between the stamps than in the remainder of the group. These
"gutter marginal" stamps are especially sought after in Italy. I am showing an entire franked
with a strip of four 40c. showing the gutter margin between the third and fourth stamps.

\section{The Second Issue, 1853}

The first stamps of Sardinia were, by law, supposed to be engraved. There was not,
however, time to make and issue these, so the lithographed stamps were prepared and
issued as a temporary expedient. Meantime, the postal officials were much agitated
by the risk of forgery and of the possibility of cleaning the postmark from stamps and using them again. It was decided that the first danger might be overcome by issuing stamps
engraved on steel and embossed in relief. These stamps are on paper of distinctive colours
(similar to the first issue of Natal). The 5c. is on blue-green paper, the 20c. on blue, and the 40c. on pale rose.

\begin{marginfigure}

\end{marginfigure}
 




The object of issuing stamps on paper of one colour was partly to overcome the danger
of cleaning, as the original idea was to have a fugitive colour which would disappear on
contact with liquid and thus make any attempt at cleaning easily perceptible, but fugitive
colours were not used.

According to an official Decree this issue was to be available in May 1853 and, theoretically, was in use at the same time as the first issue from May until the end of September.
As, however, very few are known used as early as the last day of September, it seems
probable that this was the first day they were available to the public. The first two issues used together on entire must be very rare: I have never seen one. The second and third issues used together are scarce. It seems strange and, to me, inexplicable.

Blocks and strips of this issue are scarce, especially blocks. I have a block of four of the 5c. and a used strip of four on a cover.

The piece de resistance is a block of four of the 40c. second issue used with a pair of
the 5c. third issue on a cover to America. This is the only block of four I have seen, but it does not follow there are not others in existence! Another scarce item is a pair of 40c. postmarked "Assicurata pp Biella."


\section{The Third Issue, 1854}

In gaslight, then a comparative novelty, the population found it very difficult to distinguish the 5c. blue-green from the 20c. blue of the second issue. I must confess that I find it hard to distinguish them without a very careful examination of the value. If the
relief is not very clear it is more difficult. Consequently, when this was put to the postal authorities, they decided to alter the stamps slightly by having the oval centre white with merely the king's head on it, in relief. The surrounding frames, lithographed in colours, were also made more distinctive. These are the only differences between the second and third issues and were covered by the original special Order in Council so no fresh legal authorisation was necessary.

The second issue was not withdrawn but continued in use together with the third issue
and a half months later on April 18, 1854. I am showing two covers franked with a
combination of the second and third issues.
Strips and blocks are scarce and I have only a strip of four and a block of the 5c. on
entires. The rare shade of the 5c. is known as verde reseda, which I see from the dictionary
means mignonette green. I cannot see much sign of mignonette on my specimen, but as it
has been approved by Signer Alberto Dieno, I take it that it is the real thing. This shade
was used only in Nice and on a small part of the island.

Until I collected Sardinian stamps, I did not know that the Sardinians had an Expeditionary Force on our side in the Crimean War. I have two covers of this campaign (both
from Balaclava). The first is dated 16.5.55 and is franked with the 20c. of the third issue, the other is dated 12.2.56 but has no stamp, merely the war postmark "Posta Milo-Sardi" in a double circle without the date of the year. The campaign lasted from May 15, 1855, to July 5, 1856.

There was also a war in 1859 between France and Sardinia on one side and Austria, in
which the latter was defeated. I have one stampless cover from Bressia (in Parma) to
Novara with the "Posta Milo-Sardi" N2 postmark in a double circle. There is also a cover
franked with 20c. from Parma to Bressia dated 29.8.59 used during the (fourth issue)
Provisional Government in Parma from August 1, 1859, to January 1860.

\section{The Fourth Issue, 1855}

This issue first appeared in 1855 and continued until 1863. During this period a great
quantity of stamps was issued. The colours, although they were supposed to remain the
same, gradually changed in course of time. As a result, a stamp issued in 1863 would be of
quite a different shade to that issued in 1855, in fact, sometimes almost a different colour.

Places like Sicily, where the consumption was not so large as in some parts of Italy, would have in use stamps issued much earlier than those being used in other parts at the same time. This fourth issue is much sought after, especially by collectors in Italy. Those of
the earlier years (1855-56) are very much scarcer than the later. The stamps of 1860 and
onwards are common. The only way to sort the sheep from the goats is by colour—unless
of course you are fortunate enough to have dated postmarks on the stamps, when the 
trouble is automatically solved. I am showing only a few token sheets, which I do with
apologies. Quite frankly, I am not very much interested. However, there are some quite
nice covers.

The only stamps of this issue which I am showing of any special interest are the 3 lire.
These are quite nice but the chief items are the 3 lire on a cover and the pair on a piece.

There is also a vertical strip of three and two single 80c. on a cover. These are quite good, as they are of the 1858 issue.

The fourth issue stamps with inverted heads are common in unused condition, but used
(especially on cover) they are quite scarce. I am showing three of these covers and five
single stamps. The latter have all been passed by Dr. E. Diena, who must have spent his
whole life initialling and signing scarce, and other, Italian States' stamps. However, it is always nice to have his signature, if possible.

In the Papal States bisected stamps were allowed to prepay postage, i.e. half a 40c. was
accepted for 20c. and so on. They were never officially authorised. After some time their
use was forbidden, as it was found they were a fruitful means of fraud and an easy method
of cheating the revenue. Besides the inverted heads and bisects, I am also showing a cover
with the figure "2" embossed in error on the Ic. On the same sheet I am also showing a
single with the figure "1" inverted. This is a great rarity, though I must confess it doesn't look it at first sight. I am showing half a 40c. used as a 20c. on piece and half a lOc. used
as a 5c. on an entire. Both were used in the Papal States. These bisects are found only
on the fourth issue.
