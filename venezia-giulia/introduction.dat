\chapter{Venezia Giulia}
 
"Venezia Giulia" means the "Julian March!"  It's a term made up in the 19th Century to designate a stretch of terrain encompassing what's now northeastern Italy and bits of Croatia and Slovenia.

At the end of World War I, this chunk of the Hapsburg Empire was granted to Italy, with the usual attendant wave of ethnic cleansings and human miseries.  But the mail kept running, and for the next seven years local postage was provided with either Italian or leftover Austro-Hungarian stamps with this overprint.


As with Trentino-Alto Adige. the first issue, in November 1918 consisted of overprinted Austrian stamps. The 40 heller olive is particularly scarce, but not so scarce as the top four values, 2, 3, 4 and 10 kronen. The 10 kronen (see \ref{10krone}) is exceedingly rare, as only 37 were overprinted by hand as presentation items.
