## The Second Issue.

In November, 1900, a new set, in two distinct designs or types adopted for general use throughout the German colonies, was recorded though we can find no data relating to the actual date they were placed on sale in Kamerun. The values from 3pf to 80pf are all alike
in design and show as a centerpiece the royal yacht Hohenzollern. Above is the name "KAMERUN" on a curved ribbon and at the base is "PFENNIG" with numerals at each end, also on a ribbon scroll. The mark values, also alike in design, are of the same size as those of the Fatherland, and show an enlarged view of the Hohenzollern. The colors of the respective values are similar to those of the corresponding denominations
for Germany.
