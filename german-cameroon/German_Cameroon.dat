# The Stamps and Postal History of German Cameroon

The Cameroons, or Kamerun, as it is expressed on the stamps, was a German
protectorate on the west coast of Africa extending from the Rio del Rey, a little east of the Old Calabar River, south- wards to a point where it is bounded by French Congo. On the northwest, it touches Lake Chad and on its eastern boundary is the British colony of [Nigeria](../nigeria/Introduction).

Its history dates from July, 1884, when a Hamburg firm bought the districts of Bimbia, Kamerun, Malimba, Klein Batanga, Plantation and Kribi, and
these territories were at once placed under the protection of the German Empire
as and from the 14th of that month. During 1885, territory was extended into the interior through treaties with native chiefs and the various frontiers were fixed by treaties with Great Britain and France at different times during the period 1885-93. 

The total area of the colony is 195,000 square miles and its population of about four millions comprised only 324 whites (354 of these being Germans) in 1898. The coast lands are low lying and unhealthy for Europeans, but much of the interior is high lying and healthy. The natives are Bantus on the coast and Soudanese in the interior. The former are great traders while the Soudanese are good agriculturists.

Duala (Kamerun) is the chief town and was, until April, 1901, the seat of government. Since that date, however, the capital and seat of the Landeshauptmann, or Governor, has been at {{wi:Buea}}. Buea was the colonial capital of the German Kamerun from 1901 to 1919, and the capital of the Southern Cameroons from 1949 until 1961. The German colonial administration in Buea was temporarily suspended during the eruption of Mount Cameroon from 28 April – June 1909.



The first post-office was opened at Duala (Kamerun) on February 1st, 1887. The next was opened at Victoria on December IS, 1888, and since then chief
offices have been opened at Kribi, Rio del Rey and Buea—the latter early in 1900—and sub-offices in most other places
where any whites are permanent resi- dents. The post office of the colony, as well as those of other German colonies
in Africa, is under the control of the "Ober Postdirection" (Chief Postal Administration)
at Hamburg.

## The First Issue.

Although the protectorate was declared in 1884, it was not until 1897 that
a special series of stamps was issued. Up to that time, ordinary unsurcharged
German stamps were used, and these can, of course, only be identified by the cancellations.

The issue consisted of the
3, 5, 10, 30, 35 and 50 pfennig stamps of
the 1889 issue, overprinted "Kamerun"
diagonally upwards. All six values were
recorded as issued in April, 1897, but it would seem these were simply specimen
copies which had been exhibited in Berlin.
The 10, 30 and 35pf were the first values to be placed on sale in the colony
itself and these were certainly not in use before August, while the 3, 5 and 50pf were not issued until later. The 3pf
exists in four distinct shades, the rarest being the grey-brown, which is cata- logued in Gibbons at $3.40. The 20pf
and 50pf also provide distinct shades but
the other denominations do not show any
variations worthy of note. A few of the 30pf were bisected diagonally
and each half used as lOpf for one day in 1898. Mr. Reichenheim gives an interesting account of this variety as follows
:

The German Post-office Regulations
strictly forbid the use of bisected stamps; however, on the 3rd October,
1898, about 100 pieces of diagonally-cut
stamps passed through the post in Kamerun, each half stamp actually
paying the postage fee of lOpf.
The "Germania-Ring" is of opinion
that those bisected stamps were not a necessity as the postage fee could
easily have been made up by two 5pf
stamps or combinations of other values for higher postage, or stamps
could have been procured from the neighbouring post-office of Victoria, if there were really no lOpf stamps in stock at Kamerun on that day; but Dr.
F. Martin, of Munich, a civil servant
in Kamerun at the time protests most
emphatically in a letter published by
him in one of the magazines, saying
that the stock of the lOpf as well as the 5pf was nearly exhausted shortly before the 3rd October, and the Post- master endeavored to purchase from
large firms any quantity of those values they could spare; but as the homeward mail had to be made up by
5 p. m. on the 3rd October, and the steamer from Germany, usually arriv- ing the day before and bringing a new
stock of stamps, was by chance this time not due till the following day, he
could not manage to obtain sufficient 5 or lOpf stamps to satisfy the public
demand on mail day, and was obliged
to bisect about fifty 20pf stamps, which
however, were not issued to the public, but affixed by the postoffice officials themselves, principally to picture cards requiring lOpf postage. The "Ober
Postdirection" at once made enquiries
into the matter but did not reprimand
the Postmaster, as he was really unable
to obtain anywhere 5pf or lOpf
stamps in time, the next post office, Victoria, being two days' journey, and
the cost of procuring any stamps from
there amounting to more than $25. However the case might be, the bi- sected 20pf stamps really paid the post- age of lOpf on the 3rd October, 1898, and can therefore be looked upon as great rarities.

The German post office closed in 1915 with the British occupation. "G.R.I." overprinted Kamerun yacht stamps carried British currency denominations. Kamerun yacht stamps (with watermark) were issued to collectors in Germany between 1915 and 1919.
