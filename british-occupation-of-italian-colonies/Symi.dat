## British Occupation of Former Italian Colonies
### Dodecanese, Symi
Covers bearing postage dues used in the Dodecanese and in general for MEF are considered remarkably significant rarities. In the Spink 24 Lugano Sae of  October 2012 three covers were included in what it must be one of the most remarkable collections to have been formed. We illustrate all three of them courtesy of the auctioneer.

The last cover shown below bears a 1s postage due and this is probably the only cover recorded in the Dodecanese exhibiting the highest denomination of the postage due issue.
