# British Occupation of Former Italian Colonies

## Dodecanese, Kastelorizo.

When Italy capitulated to the Allies in the autumn of 1943, a few hundred Commonwealth commandos occupied kastellorizo, departing
of their own accord in spring 1944 --- leaving the island deserted and vulnerable to the attention of pirates. In early July a harbour fuel dump caught fire and an adjacent arsenal exploded, taking with it more than half of the two thousand houses on Kastellorizo. Even before these events most of the population had left for Rhodes, Athens, Australia (especially Perth) and North America. Today there are just 342 official residents living permanently on Kastellorizo.
