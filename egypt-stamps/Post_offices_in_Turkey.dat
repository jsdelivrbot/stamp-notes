##Egypt: Stamps and Postal History
### Egypt Post Office in Greece (Volo)
The postal history of Egypt is long and complex, like its general history, and it impinges on the postal history of a large number of other countries owing to geographical location at a nexus of world trade routes. In the nineteenth century, six different countries (Austria, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, and Russia) operated extra-territorial post offices in Egypt, while at the same time Egypt had its own post offices in the Ottoman Empire at places that today are in nine different countries (Eritrea, Greece, Israel, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Turkey).
