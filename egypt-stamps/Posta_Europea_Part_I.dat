##Posta Europea

The first postal system of Egypt was organized by an Italian, Pietro Michele Meratti (wrongly identified for many years as Carlo), in 1821, and the early postmarks are all
inscribed in Italian.

In 1846 this Italian service was called \textsc{POSTA EUROPEA} and types [1] to [4], show examples of these. The first handstamp used on mail from the POSTA EUROPEA is shown below and is classified by Smith as Type I.

It is a double oval with the inscription \textsc{POSTA EUROPEA / IN ALESSANDRIA D'EGITTO}.

\subsection{Type III handstamp}
It is interesting to note that with the introduction of the Type III handstamp we start seeing dates in manuscript written within the oval and accountancy markings at the front of the letters, enabling one to study the postal rates between the various Towns.
