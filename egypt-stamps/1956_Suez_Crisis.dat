##The Suez Crisis 1956

##The Franco-British Invasion

On the 29th of October 1956, at eight-thirty in the evening, two
Israeli brigades crossed into Egyptian territory towards the small
post at Kuntilla, not far from the Gulf of Akaba. This southern
sector of the {{wi:Negev}} was almost without Egyptian defences. Advancing
at extraordinary speed across such sandy and broken country, they
soon went beyond Nakhl and in less than twenty-four hours were
within a few miles of the {{wi:Suez Canal}}.

While General Moshe Dayan
was thus playing the Napoleon, enveloping a third of the Egyptian
armed units in the south before folding back on the sea to cut their
communications, disorder reigned in Cairo which had been completely
taken by surprise by this lightning Israeli attack, London and
Paris were much less surprised at the news and the two governments
rapidly set in motion a plan which was calculated to 'bring the
Egyptian dictator to his knees' in under a week. The preliminary
phase had just been carried out with impressive thoroughness.
Mr Eden and M. Mollet announced to their respective parliaments
in the course of that afternoon that they had sent an ultimatum to
the two parties concerned calling on them to retire to a distance of
ten miles on each side of the Canal. They were also to allow the
installation of Franco-British forces at Port Sai'd, Ismailia and Suez,
otherwise those bases would be forcibly occupied 'in order to protect
freedom of navigation'. 

The Israelis were only too ready to agree
to this, as they had not yet even reached the point from which they
were ordered to 'withdraw'. The Egyptians could only reject it, as
they were called on to sacrifice even more than they had already lost
through the attack. 

At the end of the following night French and
British planes began bombarding Egyptian aerodromes, grounding
or destroying machines which had recently been bought from the
Soviet Union.

The discomfiture of Egypt appeared complete, there seemed no
further hope for the Bikbashi and his Arab alliances. The London
and Paris Cabinets had started what a French minister, in August,
had called 'the stag-hunt' and were already in full cry. 

Whitehall and
the Hotel Matignon waited for a telephone-call from Cairo to say
that the Egyptian people had come to its senses, overthrown the
dictator and accepted the internationalization of the Canal.
Ever since the abrupt nationalization of the Canal Company it
had been apparent that only two factors prevented London and
Paris from armed retaliation which was foreshadowed by the highlycharged
speeches by the heads of the two governments. These factors
were American opposition and lack of military preparation. There
was a strong current of public opinion urging the statesmen to take
up the challenge from Alexandria, until the 5th of August when the
Labour Party began its campaign against intervention. The High
Commands wanted five or six weeks in which to make ready. As soon
as, early in September, they made it known that the necessary forces
were gathered in Cyprus, the politicians and diplomats who had
supported the idea of military measures at the end of July felt that
the opportunity was gone, and that both international and British
opinion was against the use of force as a means of settling the Suez
crisis.

###Diplomatic action

Meanwhile diplomatic action was being taken, and despite the
reluctance of the Franco-British side as well as the Egyptian, the
American negotiators, together with Indian representatives and the
Secretary-General of the United Nations, had persuaded Paris,
London and Cairo on the 12th of October into a draft agreement
based on six principles. This included the withdrawal, in practice,
of the Franco-British demand for 'international management' and
an implicit recognition of the nationalization of the Company. On
the Egyptian side it involved the Egyptian recognition of the fundamental
principle that 'the working of the Canal must not be dependent
on the policy of any single power'. Acknowledging the scope of
the concessions made by its opponents, the Egyptian government
then tried to turn the proposals into realities, sending out strong
rumours of a conference to be held in Geneva. But it fell into the
capital error of not putting forward a counter-plan as its Indian and
American sympathizers expected. Thus during the week of the
12th-19th of October it lost the opportunity for a friendly settlement
which would have been in the interests of all concerned. While
Colonel Nasser was thus throwing his chances away, Washington
also made a capital mistake by diverting the Canal Users' Association
which had been founded on Mr Foster Dulles's initiative from
its real objectives. By insisting that the Association must repay Egypt
90 per cent of dues received, before beginning negotiations with
Egypt, the Americans turned a weapon for economic pressure,
designed to deprive Egypt of its profits from the July 'hold-up' or
at least a means of negotiation into nothing more or less than a tool
for capitulation. While America was busy 'playing' Egypt, Egypt
was not sincerely playing peace-cards. The supporters of military
intervention grouped round Mr Macmillan in London and round
M. Bourges-Manoury in Paris began to take heart.

Three factors were then in their favour. It is important to remember
that the means for action had existed since September: four Franco-
British divisions had been stationed in Cyprus, a Command had
been created and the undertaking had even been given a code-name.
It was to be called 'Hamilcar' a name which was subsequently
changed to 'Operation Musketeer'. Ofcourse it was not openly talked
about. But it was an open secret in Paris that more and more parachutists
were being sent to Cyprus, and that tank-formations were
being assembled not far from Algiers and embarked for 'an unknown
destination'. 

On the other hand, the seizure of the {{wi:Athos}}, a pirateship
bringing the Algerian rebels seventy tons of Egyptian arms
(loaded in the port of Alexandria with the utmost impudence and
clumsiness), provoked a violent surge of anger against Egypt in
French public opinion. In addition, the kidnapping of five leaders of
the Algerian F.L.N. on the 22nd of October strengthened the idea
that an 'energetic' policy paid dividends and that the time was coming
for a counter-attack. Finally, the Middle East was itching for
battle, and if Egypt appeared anxious to find a satisfactory solution
to the Suez affair and to run the Canal properly and involve the
French and British in prolonged discussions, at the same time Iraq,
with London's blessing, was preparing to occupy eastern Jordan.
Indeed, the Anglo-Iraq plan aimed not only at absorbing the larger
part of that little kingdom, which pointedly anti-British elections and
a series of frontier incidents with Israel were threatening to throw into
chaos, but fulfil the old dream of the 'Fertile Crescent' which would
link Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon in one great State closely
linked with Great Britain.

British diplomacy believed that this achievement would compensate
for Its setback at Suez, and would also have the advantage of being
a bitter pill for both Nasser and Egypt, relegating it to the status
of a second-class Power in comparison with an expanded Iraq.
But Mr Eden's French partners were much less enthusiastic. It
is a fixed tenet of French diplomacy that the setting up of the
'Fertile Crescent' would mean its eviction from the Middle East, and
that only its defence of Syrian and Lebanese independence keeps
France its friends and customers and markets there. What was the
point in losing in both Cairo and Baghdad? The French leaders also
pointed out that the creation of such a great Arab State would
threaten Israel, the 'best friend of the West in the Middle East', with
extinction, adding that the Jerusalem government had made clear
that it would resist rather than let itself be hemmed in.
Since the plucky Jewish State was ready to fight, and since the main
aim after all was to humiliate Nasser and teach Pan-Arabism a
lesson, why not redirect the Israel-Arab dispute over Jordan towards
Sinai? 

The military experts were all agreed that in spite of Nasser's
enormous efforts as regards armaments since September 1955, the
Israeli army would easily crush the Egyptian forces, at least so long
as the latter had not been trained in the use of their Soviet weapons,
which would mean another two years. However, London hesitated.
It was tempted to inflict a military defeat on Nasser, but to compromise
oneself by coming out on the side of Israel and risk offending
Iraq did not appeal to the Foreign Office, which still hugs the idea
of a return of the Anglo-Arabism of 1918 and 1945.

All through the month of October the French and British governments
therefore followed parallel courses. Eden and Selwyn Lloyd
were mounting the Jordan operation with Baghdad while making
more and more concessions over the Canal in order to lull Cairo's
suspicions. Meanwhile the French Cabinet received numerous visits
from delegates of the Israeli High Command. Was there any Franco-
Israeli Treaty in the formal sense of the word? Proofs of this are still
wanting. It has certainly been stated1 that on a visit to London in the
middle of October on the instructions of the President of the French
Council, M. Albert Gazier communicated to or discussed with the
British a certain document containing a formal guarantee of the
State of Israel by the French. A few days earlier Mr Ben-Gurion
had referred, in the Knesseth, to a 'great ally' whose name he would
soon be in a position to disclose. In public declarations made by
i Bulletin of the Centre ^Information du Proche-Orient (C./.P.0.), Paris.


MM. Mollet and Pineau in September and October, they hinted
several times at a 'diplomatic secret' which allowed them to believe
that 'the last word had not been said over the Suez Affair', and that
'the possibility of using force is not yet excluded'.
In the September the visit to France of Mr Menahem Begin,
leader of the extreme Right party in Israel, the 'Herouth', and an
open supporter of a preventive war against Egypt, and the contacts
he then made in influential circles in France, encouraged the suspicion
that some plan was being worked out. A great deal of movement
between Paris and Israel went unnoticed at the time. In the event the
real 'warning shot' addressed to Egypt was a surprising speech delivered
by the President, Ben-Gurion, to the Knesseth on the 15th
of October. While three serious incidents had occurred on the Israel-
Jordan frontier, and while threats of the Iraqi Anschluss were being
talked of in the world Press and the Amman elections suggested
that there would be increased tension on the Jordan, the Jewish
statesman said not a word against Iraqi troop-movements and
turned all his eloquence against 'Israel's only real enemy', that is to
say Egypt, on whose borders there had not been a serious incident
since the Suez crisis began. What was the significance of all this?

A few well-informed people gave this event the serious attention it
deserved, but observers on the spot were content with noting the
'surprise' to public opinion in Israel, since everyone there was
primarily concerned with Jordan and the eastern border.
Events now moved quickly. The next day, the 16th ofOctober (or so
it has been said*), MM. Mollet and Pineau and their British colleagues
decided on their threefold operation directed at the Canal. Opinion
in Paris was indignant at the first clear proof the interception of
the Athos II of an intolerable intervention on Egypt's part in the
Algerian conflict. The Mollet government was increasingly attacked
for the contrast between his outspokenness and the diplomatic inertia
into which his allies had dragged him, without wringing the slightest
real concession from the stubborn Egyptian dictator. The Congress
of the French Radical Party held in Lyons 'regretted' the Cabinet's
behaviour, while both the M.R.P. and Independents made it plain
that they would not allow this capitulation to Nasser to pass unchallenged.

The anti-French demonstrations in Syria and Jordan
after Ben Bella's arrest revived anti-Arab feeling in France. Thus it
was enough for the Palestinian fidtfiyin to commit one of the many
acts of aggression that had caused so much bloodshed on the frontier
for the past two years, for the tripartite action to begin large-scale
Israeli attacks, followed by a 'pacifying
5 intervention by France and
Britain. 

However, on the 21st of October the death of two Israeli
soldiers near Gaza did not result in any retaliatory action. It was
without any immediate provocation that General Dayan's forces,
which four days earlier had been brought up secretly by bus to the
southern Negev, started moving early on the night of the 29th
October. Why? Everything suggests that the French wanted a few
days longer, and that nothing was ready on the 21st or 29th. But it
is not unlikely that the Israelis thought they would do well to strike
before the American elections on the 6th of November, and that the
new flare-up of the Russo-Hungarian crisis would distract world
attention including Russia's away from the Middle East. Through
Israel forestalling the agreed plan, the operation took both London
and Paris by surprise, although it had been laid some time before.
But there were swift reactions. The day after the Israeli attack
began the French and British governments sent out their ultimatum
in spite of M, Mendes-France's warnings to M. Mollet1 and those
given to Mr Eden by the majority of the British Press and the Labour
Opposition. The military intervention was generally unpopular in
Britain from the outset; socialism, puritanism, a reliance on legal
processes, and a sense of realism all uniting to denounce the undertaking
as 'immoral and lunatic'

But the French public, which had
long been exasperated by Egyptian interference in North African
problems, and enraged against the Cairo government by propaganda
to which Nasser's behaviour only added more fuel, welcomed
this curious form of arbitration by bombers as a necessary corrective.

It must be said that apart from a few individuals who believed that
eliminating one man was only a short-term solution, and in the end
would only embitter Arab demands, and those on the other hand
who thought that this 'throw of the dice' was more fraught with
international perils than with benefits for France in the Maghrib,
most French people's reaction was to say, 'Nasser has gone too far.'

The two government leaders had underestimated the risks. After
the strong disapproval on the home front, violently and sharply
expressed by the Labour Party chief, Mr {{wi:Hugh Gaitskell}}, there came
an American reaction of a bitterness and harshness that neither

1 M. Mendfcs-France on the 30th demanded a four-power conference to preserve
peace. 2 The Observer.

London nor Paris had thought possible: 'So the French and British
are going to Suez via Dien-Bien-Phu . . .* declared a senior State
Department official on the 30th of October. 1 This was followed by
a series of condemnations against the two Powers from the Security
Council and the U.N.O. General Assembly, in which they were called
on to withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory and suggestions
were made for hurriedly creating an international police force to
take over from the invaders from Port Said to Gaza. Then the
threatening Russian ultimatum of the 5th of November hinted at the
outbreak of atomic warfare, giving the 'throw of the dice' of the
30th ofOctober a far more tragic significance than Mendes-France or
Gaitskell had thought of.

Indian and Canadian opposition within the Commonwealth, that
of the Labour Party and the independent newspapers in London,
together with warnings from Washington, Moscow and the 'anticolonialist'
majority in the United Nations thus brought about a
cease-fire on the 7th of November. During the previous forty-eight
hours British parachute troops, backed by a naval bombardment of
Port Said, had installed themselves in the town after severe fighting.
Meanwhile the French had taken the Gamil and Port Fuad airfield
and were advancing along the Ismailia highroad in order to dominate
the Canal. The cease-fire given during the night of the 6th-7th of
November held up the whole operation only thirty-six hours before
its completion, within three miles of El Kantara. The Franco-British
troops were thus in control of less than a third of the Canal. However,
the Egyptian High Command had already had time in which to
increase the cost of the offensive by sinking forty ships which were to
block the traffic for at least six months. Nothing remained for the
invaders but to evacuate Port Said, where the international 'policeforce'
came in to take their place.

The balance-sheet of the offensive can be summed up as follows:
the Egyptian army had been shattered by the Israeli attack and the
French and British bombardments. But the Canal, which was supposed
to have been 'liberated', was put out of service for months,
with serious effects for the shipping of oil to Europe, Egypt's
Arab alliances appeared to have broken down, but though Colonel
Nasser's prestige suffered from the defeat of his Sinai army, it was
restored by the solid international action in favour of Egypt. The
defeated Colonel was now seen as the head of a small nation
i Le Monde, 31 October 1

attacked by two Great Powers, protected by the leaders of two great
world empires and saved by the 'world conscience'. The result of
Franco-British intervention had been to save Nasser's face, transforming
his defeat at the hands of a small neighbouring state into 'imperialist
aggression'.

We do not propose to look into the consequences of the third
Egyptian expedition (the first of which destroyed Saint Louis and
the second of which led Bonaparte to the seizure of power on the
18 Brumaire), so far as they affect France, Britain, Israel or the
United States, but rather to give a rapid interpretation of its immediate
effects in Egypt. The fact is that it simply prolonged and
accentuated the effects of the initial Suez affair. It increased Nasser's
popularity, confirmed now in his role of 'pilot' of the Arab peoples,
sailing on in spite of 'imperialist* plots. It strengthened the anti-
Western feeling among the Egyptian masses, now convinced by
propaganda and the turn of events that the Western Powers had no
intention of respecting the Eastern nations' independence. Together
with this went a surge of feeling in favour of Soviet Russia, whose
harsh notes of the 5th and 10th of November created a powerful
impression. Though these came at the very moment when Hungary
was being martyred, they gave Russia an immense prestige as 'protectors
of the smaller nations' all over the Arab world. All who witnessed
it were struck by the tremendous rise of the popularity of the Soviets
with the Egyptian people. For instance, a neutral journalist who
returned from Cairo to Paris in March 1957 wrote in the French
weekly Reforme (26 July 1957):

'One had to be in Egypt during the nationalization of the canal,
the Security Council debates and the armed intervention by Israel,
France and Britain, in order to understand the prestige which the
Russians were able to gain at no cost to themselves. The Russians
"EIRouss" were regarded as supermen "flying to the victims' help".

As a result the crushing of the revolt in Budapest was viewed as being
to Russia's credit.*

This psychological drift towards the East, accompanied as it was
by strong economic and industrial support, may be regarded as the
decisive outcome of the chain-reaction crises from which Egypt has
suffered. We need to be more cautious than before in estimating
Nasser's popularity and his government's length of life. In spite of
all the applause with which he is at present surrounded, yet we believe


that a crack has shown in the 'Officers' republic'. The dictator is still
playing his part with the same boldness and coolness. But if, as we
have said, the whole regime is based on the army, it surely follows that
the military breakdown during the Sinai conflict, in a matter of days,
is bound to have a deep effect on the morale and efficiency of the
ruling class of officers in spite of all the flashy declarations of victory
that came over the wireless.

We have no desire to mock at troops which were outclassed by a
bolder and better-trained force. But if it has been possible to delude
the Egyptian public, the authority wielded by the 'Khaki shirts' in the
various branches of state affairs is likely to be undermined by events
at Sinai. What form will the army's dissatisfaction take, once the
people responsible are made to give an account of themselves? Once
again the Franco-British intervention helped the government by
blinding people to the facts and turning inefficient and boastful
leaders into martyrs.

However, the facts were not obscured to such an extent that the
Egyptian people failed to realize their officers' true calibre. In Cairo
in February 1957 an officer was trying to pass to the head of a queue,
when a lower-class civilian shouted, 'You weren't in such a hurry in
Sinai, Captain.' Only a year before nobody would have dared say
such a thing, nor would an officer have let it pass: it shows a significant
change in the public's attitude towards the army.

Another unpleasant outcome for the President is that the Sinai
defeat and the army's general behaviour in the war confirm the
arguments put forward not so long ago by General Neguib and
especially his friend Colonel Ahmed Shawki, which was that an
army which dabbles in politics becomes unfit for defending the
country: 'they should stick to their barracks'. There is no doubt that
one of the main reasons for the collapse at Sinai is that since the
military government was formed the two or three hundred best
officers in the Egyptian army have left their job and their troops in
order to run a ministry, administer a province or run some public
service or direct the police force. The 'Falluja tigers* of the past are
now sitting behind office desks.

While the army 'cracked up' in October, the militia, which was
hastily formed and called the 'Liberation Army*, distinguished itself
by the courage with which it resisted at Port Said. Observers on the
spot regarded this as decisive, particularly Jean-Jacques Faust, the
correspondent of the Agence-France-Presse, who gave a brilliant

analysis of the masses* sudden awareness of their own importance at
he time, in an article published in Etudes mediterraneennes in June
1957:

Whatever might be saidabout this new "proletarian awakening", the
:estimony of those who live in contact with the lower classes "poor
whites", Greeks or Italians, Christian by faith all points in the same
direction. From the time when the government called on them to
defend their country and enrolled and armed them, inviting them to
unite in their hatred for the foreigner (and almost inevitably "the
rich"), a radical change came over those "God-forgotten men" whom
nobody had ever seemed to need before and who had always seemed
doomed to the same lot, mere robots making the same gestures of
toil from day to day. Only some change of consciousness, of selfawareness,
can explain the seriousness and sense of self-imposed
discipline of the Liberation Army volunteers. Though inadequately
trained and equipped, there were few cases in which there was any
attempt to profit personally, by murder or theft, from the confused
situation. As a result it is impossible for the regime to go back to
what it was before the Suez affair. In this sense the Suez expedition
has weakened Nasser's position as much as strengthened it. It has
obliged the dictator to run the risk of a "real revolution".'

But the main reason for Colonel Nasser's weakness is that he was
saved thanks to Russian interference. He is beholden to Moscow.
This awkward and distasteful fact is likely to be held against him: it
is already making him enemies, especially in the Arab world, as was
seen during the autumn crisis. Neutrality used to pay dividends.
The Americans are now trying to offset the influence and prestige
of Russia in Nasser's eyes, and the tug-of-war is likely to become
more intense when it comes to discussing the financing of the High
Dam project. Egypt's 'neutral' policy is now too compromised and
committed for her to have any real independence or economic selfdetermination.
Nasser owes too much to the authors of the Russian
ultimatum for his fate not to depend on further Russian pressure
in his favour. But should that pressure be relaxed for any reason,
the Americans who are now wooing Egypt will drop him at once. He
thus becomes the kind of item that is haggled over at Yalta . . .
Maybe the Colonel would be well advised to rediscover the caution
which served him so well until the beginning of 1956. Will he have
the sense to avoid whatever the cost the urge to take revenge for

the humiliation he suffered at Sinai? In view of his statement, 'We
are not at war with Israel,' which he made on the 4th of November,
is he capable of seeking better and more permanent relations with the
Jewish State? Can he not see that the only realistic solution is to cut
his losses in the north and slash his heavy military commitments in
order to set Egypt on its feet industrially?

Another thing which was shown by the violent weeks of autumn
1956 is that in spite of being egged on by propaganda the Egyptian
people gave signs of such genuine human feeling. In such a crisis
it was far more remarkable to see such people respecting foreign
residents, most of whom were denounced as 'enemies', than to see
them manning turrets and brandishing rifles. Port Said alone was
the scene of pillage and brutality, directed against the Jews, while the
'cold pogrom' which was legalized against them was unworthy of
Egypt.

But J.-J. Faust, who witnessed the event and was arrested and
expelled from the country, says of the Egyptian people's behaviour:
'Many French and English nationals noticed during those unhappy
days, that apart from a few profiteers who were eager to snap up the
deportees' property for next to nothing, which they did with the
utmost arrogance, many Egyptians were kinder to them than normally,
going out of their way to make up for the brutality of the police.
This is the more to their credit as a recent law made it a crime against
State security to have any contact with enemy deportees.'

Costly as it was for all concerned with the exception of the
Russians the Suez affair gives a clear demonstration of the changed
relationship between colonizing and recently colonized nations.
Have the Europeans really admitted that there is no further point in
trying to manage Eastern states? The lesson' which was incompletely
given in 1956 will not prevent the smaller countries, who are only
too eager to put an end to every sign of foreign exploitation or control,
scrapping the 'one-sided' treaties as soon as they see a way of
having them revised or suspended. They are likely to oppose the
righteous indignation of the Great Powers by invoking their right to
take over what has always belonged to them, in much the same way
as socialist theory in the nineteenth century justified the violence of
the proletariat.

With its blustering language and its savagery on the technical
plane, the seizure of the Canal is an important new step in the

under-developed nations' will to inherit all the wealth which Western
techniques have developed on their soil. It is an example of a bad
solution to the problem, whether these poor countries can equip
themselves without losing all or some of their newly-found
independence. It is, of course, to be expected that Western capital
as represented by the International Bank would insist on checking
the use of funds advanced to Egypt towards the construction of the
new Dam. It is no more surprising that a nation which is anxious
to avoid the restrictions of 'financial imperialism
1 should try to pay
for an undertaking on which its very life depends, by diverting to it
the revenue from another undertaking which in many respects could
be considered as a national property.

However, we are not obliged to accept such a harsh form of dialectic.
It is not inevitable for the relations between rich and poor nations
to consist of nothing but a see-saw of oppression on the part of the
strong and banditry on the part of the weak. There is no reason why
weak countries should have to ensure their liberty and survival by
flouting laws made by Great Powers.

##The Aftermath

The fallout from the crisis was huge.


For a start, it got the Soviet Union off the hook, 
as it was brutally crushing the Hungarian uprising at the same time.
But it also meant that no longer could Britain - or France - act alone on the world stage.

However, Britain and France drew different conclusions.

Harold Macmillan, who succeeded Eden, decided that in future Britain had to side with America. He made good friends with President John F Kennedy and even persuaded Kennedy to let Britain have the Polaris nuclear missile.

Since then, Britain has been reluctant to oppose any US policy. Even during Vietnam, the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson forbade criticism of the US while shrewdly refusing Lyndon Johnson's request to send a token force.

###French disconnection

France on the other hand went its own way, led in due course by de Gaulle. It left the military command structure of Nato and turned to leading Europe alongside a newly prosperous Germany.

Just as Britain always thereafter tended to side with the US, so France tended to oppose it.

Modern revisionist theories hold that the mistake was really made by President Eisenhower, in that he showed a weakness that the Soviet Union exploited.

Whatever one's views of that, there is no doubt that Suez represented the end of a long phase of British imperial history. 

The course taken by the Suez affair can teach both sides what can
and what cannot be done. In spite of his superficial success we can
be sure that Nasser is by no means satisfied by the operation as a
whole, or with the effect on his own reputation and on his relations
with the West. Mr Dulles's tactical skill holds out no better prospects
for Washington than for London and Paris: in any case, the State
Secretary's balance-sheet is by no means the one he had expected on
the 18th of July 1956. 

As for the Soviets, they have proved that they
were really better prepared than their rivals for winning the confidence
of the ex-colonial countries. Yet they had to admit their
ineffectiveness when it came to taking over the financing of the
{{wi:Aswan_dam}} project from the Western Powers. They know full well that
their newly-established positions can have no lasting value unless
they are backed by a genuine development within Egypt itself, involving
a complete change in its economic structure, as well as a
stabilizing of the Egyptian Left, which is far from being in sight.
