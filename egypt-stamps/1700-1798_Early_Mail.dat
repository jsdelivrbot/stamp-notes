##Early Letters


###18th Century Mail

A lot of the surviving letters are addressed to well know Merchants of Greek origin living in Venice. One such merchant is Nicolo Caragianni. The letters are normally written in beautiful hand. I tried hard to research Nicolo Caragianni, but so far did not come up with much information. Letters of the period also are found addressed to him from other areas in the Mediterranean, such as Cyprus and the Ionian Islands. 1718 (Oct 20) Entire letter from Gio Garmogliesi, a wine dealer in Cyprus, to Nicolo Caragianni in Venice with fine, "VEN / DA. MAR" handstamp featuring the Lion of St. Mark, a very scarce handstamp on mail from Cyprus.
