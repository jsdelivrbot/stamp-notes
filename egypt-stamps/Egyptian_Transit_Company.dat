\section{Egyptian Transit Company}

The Egyptian Transit Company was a company set up to compete with Waghorns operation in conveying mail and passengers from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. It was started in 1843 and taken over by the Pasha in 1846. Philatelicaly, the ETC did not leave many traces. This lot includes the oldest known receipt of the ETC of an item sent to Mr Waghorn. Also included is some documentation - in the form of fotocopies - about this postal service. The receipt is illustrated in the copies. Unfortunately, none of the copies carries a refererence to the origin in the literature. There is also a letter in Italian from the Sonnino archives dated June 17 1843, which in the text mentions the Compania Egi. dal Transito. Later that year, the company used a handstamp to mark its handling of the letters, but this letter is probably too early and because it is so hard to recognize as an ETC item, it is probably unique. A very important lot for the ambitious Egypt collector.
