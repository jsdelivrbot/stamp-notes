in 1863 the Posta europa devised the system of interpostal seals for the distribution of government mail. These colorful labels, applied to mail sacs and some letters made  their destinations very visible during sorting, which was often done by illiterate local employees . The labels also served to indicate that this correspondence had to travel for free without any fee. The Interpostals were used from 1863 to 1893.


__Egyptian Interpostal seals__ were primarily used to seal packets of letters sent within the Egyptian postal system. Sometimes multiple packets were tied together into bundles with string, the interpostal being placed over the knot. Use this way indicated the office of origin. In some cases the seals were used for repair purposes. Shown below are two scarce examples of this type of usage.

Ernest A.Kehr numbered and valued over 800 different seals in his 1962 booklet \textit{The Interpostals of Egypt, 1864-1892.} Many are relatively common unused but much less frequently found used. Collectors should be aware that Kehr Type VIII seals have been extensively faked.
