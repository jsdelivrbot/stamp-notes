##Postal Notices
Postal notices and other publications of the Post Office at the time can be a source of detailed information that sometimes cannot be found in books. The images below are from a lot offered by Feldman's in their Geneva Auction on September 2012. It includes a postal notice detailing the countries that accepted reply paid postcards.

Group of three postal notices, incl. a table of countries which accept reply paid postcards, and two documents from the Postal Administration signed by the Postmaster, a rare group. &euro;400.

The balance of the lot included these two documents, which I still need to translate.
