##Egypt: Stamps and Postal History
###1952 King of Egypt and Sudan Overprint
In 1951 as Anglo-Egyptian relations increasingly deteriorated, Prime Minsiter Winston Churchill, in a meeting with President Truman on 9 January 1952, asked for "token" American, French and Turkish forces to be sent to Suez. The President declined the request. Instead, the State Department proposed a "package deal" under which the United States, England, France and Turkey were to recognize the King of Egypt as the King of the Sudan on condition that Egypt guarantee Sudanese self-determination and accept the four-power MEC proposal.[31] The State Department proposal was no doubt a shrewd one and if tried out could probably have brought out results for England, Egypt and the incipient MEC. The British government, however, remained adamant refusing to make any concessions regarding the Sudan.

The diplomatic efforts were soon interrupted by events in Egypt. On 19 January, heavy fighting started in Ismailia between the British forces under General George Erskine and the Egyptian auxiliary troops. With the death of 64 Egyptians in the encounter, violent riots broke out in Cairo. The events of "{{wi:Black_Saturday}}," as it was called, claimed the lives of 26 people of which 17 were Europeans.[32] Foreign Minster Anthony Eden requested full American support and assistance. Secretary of State Acheson informed him that America would "participate only to protect and evacuate American nationals, if necessary, and that naval action at Alexandria involving even limited military occupation and control would be incompatible with our policy."[33] Acheson's message to Eden simply showed that America was still to decide on publicly committing its military forces in support of the British in the Middle Eastern region.
