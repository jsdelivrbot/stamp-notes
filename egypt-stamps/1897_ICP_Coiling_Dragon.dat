According to The History of Chinese Postage Stamps Volume II (published December 2004), 
archives of Imperial Post Office verified that this set of definitives was designed by 
R. A. de Villard and engraved and printed in Japan 
by retired Italian artist and master engraver Edoardo 
Chiossone as a private contractor, and the process 
employed was typographic not lithographic as its old 
name suggested. Due to some unsatisfactory experience in their 
cooperation such as printing quality and delayed delivery, IPO decided to 
order another set of definitives from Waterlow & Sons Limited, London.

Since the English inscription on this issue is 
Imperial Chinese Post, collectors called it as ICP Issue, and the Waterlow, 
London print as CIP Issue for the English inscription of that issue is Chinese Imperial Post.

The stamps were issued January 1898 and amazingly enough, there is a cover with that date, making it a First day Cover.
