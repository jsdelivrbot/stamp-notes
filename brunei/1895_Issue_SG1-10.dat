\chapter{1895 Issue}

Robson Lowe mentions these stamps in his Encyclopaedia with a note that for forty years these stamps were considered a bogus issue. However, in 1935 (see Raconteur, Vol. I, p. 82) an agreement dated 20th August 1894 with other contemporary documents came into our possession, clearly indicate their official origin and local use.

These stamps were valid for postage in Brunei and Labuan only. Up to 1906 when Brunei joined the Straits Settlements Local Postal Union, overseas mail from Brunei could only be desptached from Labuan on prepayment or the equivalent rate in Labuan stamps as the protectorate was at that time, a member of the UPU. 

The Sultan's yacht conveyed mails to and from Labuan and the stamps themselves were produced by Mr. J. Robertson (Manager of the coal mines at Sadong, Sarawak, and friend of the Sultan) and his partners.

Surviving covers appear to be be of philatelic nature and to have been generated by two massing postings of 400 letters dated from 22 July 1895. Vrery few commercial mail has survived, as the postal service was probably used very little. By 1899 the Sarawk office was re-opened, possibly due to the local office moving to Brunei Town as Robertson had lost interest in it. The local service had almost ceased, if not stopped, before Roberston left the area in 1903. \footnote{Proud, The Postal History of Borneo, p.21. }
