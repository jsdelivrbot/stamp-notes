\chapter{Introduction} 

Brunei is located on the north coast of the island of Borneo, in Southeast Asia. Apart from its coastline with the South China Sea, it is completely surrounded by the state of Sarawak, Malaysia, and in fact it is separated into two parts by Limbang, which is part of Sarawak.

Very little is known of the early period of Brunei's postal service. Communication outside the territory was maintained via Labuan Naval Base or purely fortuitous. The local issue of 1895 was apparently the only serious attempt to bring a service into being. 

The first stamps of Brunei were the 1895 "Star and crescent" set, long considered to be 
bogus but subsequently shown to be genuine, although valid only for mail within the state 
and to Sarawak and Labuan

Overprints

In 1906 stamps of Labuan came into use, overprinted BRUNEI.[1]

Brunei river stamps[edit]

In 1907 a set inscribed BRUNEI POSTAGE & REVENUE was issued showing a boat on the River Brunei. This set remained in use until 1949 during which time it went through many different printings.[1]

World War two

Brunei was fully occupied by the Japanese Army in January 1942 until liberation in June 1945. During the occupation, overprinted and un-overprinted stamps of Brunei were used as well as stamps of Japan. Following liberation, stamps of North Borneo and Sarawak were used overprinted BMA (British Military Administration).[1]

Post-war

Following the British Military Administration, stamps of Brunei returned on 2 January 1947 and in 1949 a set was issued celebrating Sultan Ahmed Tajudin's Silver Jubilee. Also in 1949 Brunei issued stamps for the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Universal Postal Union as part of a British Commonwealth omnibus issue.[1]
In 1952 a new series of definitive stamps were issued featuring Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin which was another long-running series with lasted until 1972.[2]
Regular commemorative and definitive stamp issues have continued since then.
