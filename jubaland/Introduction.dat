In 1920 the B.E.A. Protectorate was raised to the status of a Crown Colony under the title Kenya Colony.

The strip of land along the coast, approximately 10 miles wide, with the islands of lamu, Manda, 
Patta and Siwa retained their status as Kenya
Protectorate.

The name Kenya is derived from the native name of Mount kenya __Kilinyaa__ the white mountain.

In 1924 the districts of Juba River and Kismayo were ceded to Italy and became {{wi: Jubaland}}. 

 Oltre Giuba, italian for Jubaland (Somali: Jubbaland) or Juba Valley (Somali: Dooxada Jubba), formerly Trans-Juba , is the southwesternmost part of Somalia, on the far side of the Juba River (thus "Trans"-Juba), bordering on Kenya.

Italy issued its first postage stamps for Jubaland on July 29, 1925, consisting of contemporary Italian stamps overprinted "OLTRE GIUBA" (Trans-Juba). The same process was followed for the Italian commemorative issues of the time - the "Victor Emmanuel" issue, the "St. Francis" issue. On April 21, 1926, Italy issued a set of seven stamps printed specifically for the colony, depicting a map of the territory and inscribed "COMMISSARIATO GENLE / DELL' OLTRE GIUBA", then on June 1 the omnibus Colonial Institute issue included a set inscribed "OLTRE GIUBA".

Only a couple of the higher values have more than a minimal price for collectors, although as usual for remote colonies of brief existence, genuine usages on cover are seldom seen.
