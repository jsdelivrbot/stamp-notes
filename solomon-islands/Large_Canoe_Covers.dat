This letter was written by Rev. Dr. Henry Welchman, an Anglican missionary,
Born in Lichfield in 1850, and educated at Queen's College in Birmingham, Henry Welchman qualified as a surgeon and worked in his father's practice. He held a license as a lay preacher, and had contacts with former Melanesian Mission staff, including Bishop J.R. Selwyn. Welchman joined the Melanesian Mission in 1888 as a layman. After a short posting on Santa Cruz, he arrived on Isabel Island in 1890. He returned to England in 1891 to nurse the ailing Bishop Selwyn.. He was ordained a deacon in Auckland in March 1892 and a priest in June 1893, and then divided his next years between Isabel and Norfolk Island. In July 1896 he married a member of the Norfolk Islands staff, Helen Rossiter. They moved to Siota, and she became one of the first European women to live in the Solomon Islands, until her death there from dysentery three months later, on 12 January 1897.

Welchman chose to devote himself to the people of Isabel and never returned to Norfolk. He became a common sight travelling around Isabel on his small schooner "Ruth". He spent time at Siota in the late 1890s, and opened a new station on Lilihigua adjacent to Isabel. His health began to fail and he returned to England in 1901 and to New Zealand in 1906 where he died on 12 November 1908.

A few May 1907 covers with commercial correspondence from Tulagi have survived. They are extremely rare and when they come up on the market command high prices. The cover illustrated in Figure~\ref{commercial} is of particular interest as it demonstrates that until September 1907, when the stamps of the Island could be used for sending letters to destinations outside the Islands, was used with a NSW 2d.

Description:1907 commercial cover to Sydney with Large Canoes 2d tied by Tulagi cds of MY29/1907 (with another strike alongside) & NSW 2d cancelled on arrival. One of the finest of the few surviving commercial Large Canoe covers. [Until September 1907, SOLOMONs stamps paid postage only to the first overseas port, requiring stamps of the receiving territory to also be applied for on-forwarding. The vendor paid £1700 some years ago]\label{commercial}

Many covers outside the first year are of a philatelic nature. A cover from Tulagi to France was sold in the Prestige sale and is shown in Figure~\ref{france} .
