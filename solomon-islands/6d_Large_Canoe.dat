FORTUNATELY it has proved possible to assemble and collate data from an appreciable number of specimens of the 6d denomination.
The various type differences being easy to identify, the number of constant type varieties now reportedis nearly double the number previously recorded.

While there has been access to a fair number of plated strips, blocks, etc, many of the specimens examined lacked any marginal or other identification as to their position on the complete sheet.

The number of minor varieties found in this study nevertheless exceeds the number previously recorded, although more plated material is needed for confirming how many of these minor varieties are constant.

\section{Quantity printed and issued}

500 sheets, each of 60 stamps, of the 6d denomination were supplied by the printers.
14 February 1907 was the date of issue.

On 16 March 1908, 1,087 stamps had to be destroyed, as they had become stuck together due to the gum being unsuitable for use in a damp climate. This destruction was effected by putting the stamps in a tin box, weighted with a stone, that was sunk in twenty-five fathoms of water. On 1 December 1908, a further 420 stamps were officially destroyed by fire at Tulagi, as by then the second issue of 'Small Canoes' had been made available to the public.
Finally, 344 sheets, ie, 20,640 stamps, were officially destroyed by fire at Tulagi on 23 March 1909.
Thus, deducting from the original printing of 30,000 stamps of the 6d value, the 22,147 stamps
officially destroyed, the number issued was 7,853.
The foregoing figures are taken from a letter that C. M. Woodford wrote from Tulagi on 24 May 1911 to A. W. Watkin of Ropsley, New Maiden.

\section{Constant type varieties}

There are six distinctive types of the 6d value, identified vertically as Types 1-6, so that on the sheet of sixty stamps, ten stamps of each type exist. Enlargements of each type, kindly made by D. H. Geach, are shown (Figures 1-6).

Set opposite to each enlargement are the constant type varieties appertaining to that type.
The first three constant type varieties are shown in each case in italics and suffice for easy identification.

Where, however, resulting from this research, more than three constant type varieties have been found to appertain to a particular type, the additional constant type varieties of that type are enumerated, lest inadvertently any of them be attributed to some position on the sheet as a minor variety,

\section{Constant type varieties}
\subsection{Type l}
/ On 'P' of 'PRO', there is a curved coloured line on the
south-east of the loop.

\subsection{Type 6}

/ 'P' of 'PRO' has the top left corner missing.
II On 'E' of 'A TE', there is a coloured flaw on the bottom

General Note
The letters 'A' and 'N' in 'AND' appear to touch in
several of the types. Figure 6 Type 6
Paper and gum
The quality of paper used, which was not watermarked, and the nature of the gum, are identical with
those of the earlier denominations previously described.

\section{Colour}

The colour of the 6d value was chocolate.
That colour did not conform with the colour
requirements of the LJPU, which failure was rectified
when the 'Small Canoe' issue became available.

\section{Perforations}
All sheets of the 6d value were perforated 11.
Many sheets have large, clear cut, holes vertically
and small, rather rough, holes horizontally.
Some sheets, however, have small, rather rough,
holes all round.

\section{Imperforates}
Specimens imperforate horizontally between
vertical pairs exist between the 3rd and 4th horizontal
rows and an illustration, kindly prepared by
D. H. Geach, is shown (Figure 7).

Unauthorised imperforate reprints
The warning cannot be repeated too often that imperforate reprints (or 'proofs' as they have sometimes
been called) were never issued by authority and C. M. Woodford's explanation how they came to be
produced was given in a previous article. (See THE LONDON PHILATELIST, Vol 81, No 959, page 218.)

Forgeries
Forgeries exist of all values of the Large Canoe issue and a full description can be found in THE LONDON
PHILATELIST, Vol 86, Nos 1011-12, page 39.
Minor varieties
Minor varieties are listed in the Appendix (see overleaf).
While many, if not all, of them may be constant, only those confirmed as constant in the current
research are printed in bold type.
