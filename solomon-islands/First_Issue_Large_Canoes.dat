\chapter{The First Issue The Large Canoe Stamps}

The case history of the birth pains of the First Issue having already been published, this
section starts with the essays that W. E. Smith & Co, the printers and engravers in Sydney,
submitted to C. M. Woodford in 1906.

It is presumed that Woodford had retained them because they were first reproduced in
in the booklet written by R. P. (later Sir Reginald) Croom-Johnson who personally knew
Woodford. (Figs 1, 2 and 3). Some twenty-eight years later, they appeared in the well known
publication of H. G. D. Gisburn.2

But although W. E. Smith & Go's estimates were reasonable, Woodford liked none of
the designs submitted and, being an individualist and full of enterprise, he set about composing
a lay-out himself. Little did he realise that he was creating what has become a
philatelic classic.

\section{The Design}

Ready-to-hand, as a centre-piece, was the paddle-propelled war canoe (tomako) used by the
head-hunting savages - the picturesque shape of which the early Spanish explorers had
likened to that of a crescent moon.

Tulagi harbour seemed apt as an artistic background. For flanking ornaments, coconut
palms, from which most of the islands' revenue was derived, were apposite. A turtle, a pearl
and a snail shell, representing other items of commerce, were placed in the foreground.
Lettering and two value tablets completed the sketch for the first postage stamp of the
Protectorate.


\section{Values and colours}
The values and colours selected were :

\begin{tabular}{ll}
1d Ultramarine &5d Emerald-green\\
Id Rose-carmine &6d Chocolate\\
2d Indigo &1s Bright purple\\
Orange-yellow &\\
\end{tabular}

\end{figure*}

\section{Printing the Large Canoes}

Woodford forwarded his own sketch to W. E. Smith & Co, in Sydney, who engraved from
it a die 'on a piece of copper about the size of a lady's visiting card'.
Lithography, being quick and inexpensive, was chosen as the method of printing. From
the die, on which the value tablets had been left blank, transfers were prepared for each
denomination, put on to an intermediate stone and the value added.

Each denomination was then transferred from the intermediate stone, in strips of either
three transfer papers (1d and 2\half d) or six transfer papers (other values) to the printing stone.

It would have been at the intermediate stage that constant type varieties occurred, caused
maybe through lack of evenness or distortion of the transfer paper or because minute
particles of foreign matter became attached to it.

The final stone consisted of ten horizontal rows, each of six stamps, so that, with the \half d
and 2\half d values, the three types would occur twice in a row, namely
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3
in sequence, and, with the other values, the six types would all be in a straight line, namely
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

During the final stage of preparing the printing stones, joined-together letters or other
imperfections in the design could arise through tiny creases or ridges in the transfer paper
or because specks of dust or other extraneous matter, adhering to the plate when ink had
been applied, had become sensitised, thus producing constant minor varieties in various
positions on the sheet.

There was only one printing of the First Issue.

Printing took place on an unwatermarked, thickish, coarse-textured, white wove paper.
A thick white gum was used.4

\end{marginfigure}

Reading upwards on the left side of the sheet are the words :
'SIXTY STAMPS AT ONE HALFPENNY'
(or other value)
and the sheet number, eg 600, reading downwards, appears opposite the top row in the
right margin.
A roughly-inscribed cross in the centre of the top margin is found on the sheets of 2d
and 6d stamps.

The First Issue forms a paradise for all who revel in varieties in perforation. As someone
facetiously remarked, the stamps look as if they had been perforated by a sewing machine!
In fact, perforation was effected by two single-line machines gauging 11, one making
small holes and the other larger ones. But, although the printer's intention was no doubt that
which is stated in Gisburn's handbook, the number of varieties is legion. There are mixed
small and large perforations, horizontally and vertically; double perforations, small and
large; back to front perforations; unaligned perforations; missing perforations; imperforate
margins; imperforate between stamps, horizontally and vertically; but no stamps
imperforate on all four sides.

The width between lines of perforations varies considerably. Horizontally, it is from
29 to 35 mm: vertically, it is from 26 to 29 mm. No precise dimensions for the size of the
stamps can thus be given.

Some sheets of wholly imperforate specimens of the First Issue (improperly described
as proofs) were produced on thick art paper but they are fraudulent and no more than
paper waste. They were secretly printed from the original plates by a confidential employee
of the printer without his knowledge or consent and sold by that employee to a Sydney
dealer who in turn, sold them to a dealer in London. As soon as these spurious stamps
were discovered, as many as possible were recovered from the dealer in London and
destroyed.5

\section{The quantities printed}

Altogether 1,000 sheets of each value up to and including 2 1/2d and 500 sheets each of the three higher values were printed.6

Far fewer were, however, issued due to several causes, some having to be put in a tin
box, weighted with stones, and sunk into the sea because batches of sheets had become
hopelessly stuck together in consequence of the damp climate.
The date of first issue was 14 February 1907.

There is illustrated (Fig 4) from the Geach Collection an official registered cover in the
handwriting of W. M. Woodford, franked with a complete set of the Larger Canoe issue.

\section{Revision needed}

Howard writes in the London Philatelist taht as: 'informative as Gisburn's handbook is, in some parts it is incomplete while, in other respects,
it needs revision'.  He continues listing his research into the plating and classification of the constant varities.
With that objective in view, previously published data are in course of being re-examined
by the author, inspired and aided by D. H. Geach, a member of the 'Royal'. Helping too
in that task are J. A. Ward, also of the 'Royal' and D. G. Franks, fellow members of the
Pacific Islands Study Circle of Great Britain, to whom cordial thanks are due.

Howard's initial studdy was made from, four complete mint sheets of the 1/2 d value were scrutinised, the
particulars of which are:

Sheet No From the collection of Sheet No From the collection of
286 D. H. Geach 331 D. G. Franks
324 F. B. Howard-White 600 F. B. Howard-White

Additionally, there was available a partly-reconstructed sheet of the id value from the
author's collection, in which a block from sheet No 594 appears.

While the colour of the ink on the sheets examined ranged from deep to pale blue,
Gisburn's assumption that the sheets with the lowest marginal numbers were of the deepest
shade is not confirmed. The colour of sheet No 600 is as vivid as that of sheet No 286.
Constant type varieties
First to be studied were the constant type varieties of the £d Large Canoe. There are three
types, each appearing twenty times on a sheet. The outcome was rewarding. Gisburn
lists three constant type varieties for Type 1, two such varieties for Type 2 and two such
varieties for Type 3, ie a total of seven. No less than twenty-four constant type varieties
have now been found in the £d value. Of those twenty-four varieties, nine are in Type 1,
eight in Type 2 and seven in Type 3.

To distinguish one type from another, prima facie only one distinguishing characteristic
for each type is needed. However, in the tabulations that follow, not only are there printed
in heavy type the three most easily seen imperfections but, in ordinary type, there are listed
all other constant type varieties that can be detected in the type in question. For, unless
that is done, the unwary can unwittingly classify a constant type variety as a constant
minor variety attributable to a particular position on the sheet.

The enlargements (Fig 5 and 6), kindly made by D. H. Geach, are of stamps Nos 1 and 3 on
part of sheet No 540. They show clearly the chief constant type varieties of Types 1 and 3. An
illustration of Type 2 will be published in the next number of THE LONDON PHILATELIST.
As compared with the three Type 1 constant type varieties mentioned by Gisburn, details

\subsection{Constant type varieties}

We illustrate a block taht was originally in the Baillie collection in Figure~\ref{baillie} that shows clearly the three types found on the \half d postage stamps. I find the easiest characteristics to be easily seen even with the naked eye.

\subsubsection{Type 1}
I From the top of 'T' of 'TEC', a downwards coloured dash curves to the right.

II Above 'I' of TIT, there is a slanting coloured stroke between the colour and the curved
coloured line above.

III The outer coloured circle round the left value disc has a break on the left and the top of the 'd' leans to the left.

IV The outer frame line has:

(i) an elongated coloured flaw half-way up on the left and
(ii) a downwards projection from the colour above T of 'ISL'.

V On the left of 'P' of 'POS', the third rectangle down has most of the hatching missing.
VI On the inner vignette line, there is an upwards projection from the colour, below the
4th and 5th paddle from the left.

VII Above 'S' of 'ISH', there is an upwards projection from the colour.
VIII Below'S' of 'STA', there is a vertical white flaw.
IX There is a coloured flaw on the horizontal coloured line above the three vertical
strokes above 'S' of 'STA'.

\subsubsection{Note on Type 1}

In many cases of Type 1 stamps, the 'B' of 'BRI' is nicked low down on the left but as it does not occur on every Type I specimen, it has been listed as a constant minor variety for certain positions.

Coming next to the Type 2 constant type varieties, of which only two are listed by Gisburn,
particulars of the eight constant type varieties in Type 2 now known to exist are as follows:
BSIP

Large Canoe
Constant type varieties
Type 2

I Above 'N' of 'NDS', there is a slanting coloured stroke between the colour and the curved
coloured line above.

II On'T' of 'TEC', there is a coloured dot near the foot.

III In the right value disc, the top of the 'd' slopes downwards to the right and the letter
lacks the normal foot.

IV In the left value disc (i) the edge of the colour is uneven round the top (ii) the colour
projects from the south-east side and (ii) on the south-west side, the edge of the colour is
uneven, with a coloured dot nearby
.
V Below both 'R' and 'T' of 'ROT', a faint downwards projection from the colour can
be seen.

VI Above 'O' of 'MON', there is a downwards coloured projection from the outer frame
line.

VII Above 'B' of 'BRT, there is, on the north-west, an upwards bulge in the colour.

VIII Below 'R' of 'ROT', the hatching in the sky forms a coloured flaw.

\subsubsection{Note on Type 2}

On many Type 2 specimens, the inner vignette line is broken centrally on the right but, as
this defect cannot consistently be seen on every Type 2 stamp, it has been listed as a constant minor variety for certain positions, as indicated later.

Thirdly, as against Gisburn's citation of only two constant type varieties for Type 3, the
descriptions of the seven constant type varieties that have now been detected in that type
are:
BSIP
%d Large Canoe



\subsection{Type 3}

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../solomon-islands/type-3.jpg}

I Below 'P' of 'POS', the inner frame line is broken.

II The inner coloured circle round the left value disc is broken on the right.

HI The outer coloured circle round the left value disc is defective on the north-east side and adjoins a coloured flaw.

IV In the left value disc, there is (i) a projection from the colour on the south-east side
and (ii) a coloured dot on the 'd'.

V In the right value disc (i) the edge of the colour is uneven at the top and (ii) there is an
upwards white projection from the curl of the 'd' on which letter there is a faint coloured
dot.

VI Below 'S' of 'NDS', the extreme right vertical coloured stroke between the inner and
outer vignette lines is broken.

VII On the left of T' of 'TEC', there is a faint white flaw.

Large Canoe
General note on
Constant type varieties
Examples of 'AN' of 'AND' being joined at foot, or nearly so, are numerous but as they are
not limited to any one type, they are not included as a constant type variety.

\subsubsection{Constant minor varieties}
The second outcome of the current research relates to constant minor varieties in the
value and should assist platers.

Full details have been set out in Appendix A, a copy of which has been placed in the
Society's library. Allocated to each of the sixty positions on the sheet are three main
distinguishing characteristics. The first one, wherever possible, is unique to that position.

The details of the other imperfections will serve as a check although similar defects may
occur in other positions. Each position number is followed by the type number, in brackets.
Key to plating

Although division into the three different types shortens the tedious task of reading through the whole list of constant minor varieties, when plating a particular stamp, the key to plating in Appendix B should serve to save time. A copy of this appendix is also in the library.

It is arranged alphabetically and where an abnormality can be related to some easily
seen feature, eg a letter in a word or proximity to a value tablet or scroll, it should be
possible to locate the position straightaway.
