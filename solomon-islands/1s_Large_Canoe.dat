\chapter{The 1s Large Canoe}

The last stamp to be discussed from the series  the 1/- Large Canoe completes the plating research on the Large Canoe Issue of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The study follows that of Howard, who researched and published the issue in the \textit{London Philatelist} over a period of almost 10 years.

Collectors will already be aware of H. G. D. Gisburn's excellent book on the stamps and Postal History of the Solomon Islands but, informative as it is, several philatelists had noticed that certain abnormalities in the Large Canoe Issue are not mentioned in it. Moreover, when this study began, it was not realised that in the Colonial Office archives at the Public Record Office there was a wealth of information about C. M. Woodford who, without the authority of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, had established a Post Office in the Solomon Islands and had privately ordered the
printing of a set of stamps, subsequently catalogued as the First Issue of those islands.
Under the title of 'Solomon Islands Revelations', the curtain has since been lifted on what had
taken place behind the scenes and can be read in the July and August-September 1972 numbers of \textit{The London Philatelist}. Nor was it appreciated how much material suitable for examination there is in private collections and, as the programme progressed, it has been highly gratifying that far more identifiable specimens than were anticipated have become available.

The number of constant type varieties recorded is, in some cases, more than double those known before and, while there has been a substantial increase in the number of constant minor varieties, still more may yet be proved, as and when appropriate evidence is adduced.

One of the rewards of research is the pleasure of sharing with others what has been discovered and, now that all the results have been announced, it is hoped that not only will the expert knowledge of the specialist be widened but that all who are building up a collection will be entranced by these fascinating stamps.

\section{Quantity printed and issued}
500 sheets, each of 60 stamps, ie a total of 30,000 of the 1/- denomination were printed.
The date of issue was 14 February 1907. 1,406 of those stamps that had become hopelessly stuck together through the dampness of the climate were officially destroyed on 16 March 1908 by being put into a tin box, weighted with a stone, and sunk in twenty-five fathoms of water.

As the Second Issue (Small Canoe) had become available to the public on 27 October 1908, 
Large Canoe stamps of the 1/- denomination were officially destroyed at Tulagi by fire on 1 December 1908. Lastly, on 23 March 1909, 346 sheets, containing 20,760 stamps of the I/- value, were officially destroyed by fire at Tulagi.

Thus, deducting the 22,709 stamps destroyed from the total of 30,000 printed, the number of l/- stamps issued was 7,291. The 1/- stamp although not rare is not easily found.

A letter written from Tulagi by C. M. Woodford to A. W. Watkin of Ropsley, New Maiden on
24 May 1911 is the authority for the foregoing data.

\section{Constant type varieties}
In the 1/- value, each horizontal row has six distinct types, numbered 1-6 from left to right, and, as each type repeats itself in the ten vertical columns, ten specimens of each type occur on the sheet.

Enlargements, kindly prepared by D. H. Geach (Figures 1-6) are shown and, opposite each enlargement, details are given of the constant type varieties appertaining to that type.
The first three constant type varieties found in each of the six types are printed in italics and these should make easy identification of the type concerned.

It is, however, necessary to cite all varieties appertaining to each type that are constant because, unless that is done, a variety could be mistaken for a minor variety attributable to a particular position
on the sheet.


\subsection{Type l}

\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../solomon-islands/1s-type-1.jpg}

I On 'N' of 'NDS', the left vertical stroke has a curved
coloured mark at the top.

II On 'C' of'CTO', the colour projects upwards into the
bottom of the 'C".

III Below 'P'0' and '£' of 'POS', the colour projects
downwards into the white space above the inner frame line.
IV In the left value disc:

(a) where the right horn joins the inner vignette line, the
small coloured circle is almost a coloured dot; and

(b) the '1' is misshapen on the left.

V On 'O' of 'OST, the colour projects into the left side.
VI In the right value disc, on the north-east, the perimeter
of the colour is uneven.

\section{Constant type varieties}

\subsection{Type 2}

I Above the right value disc, just above where its outer
coloured circle joins the inner vignette line, part of the
foliage and lines of shading are missing.

II In 'A' of'ATE' below the cross bar, the colour projects
into the right leg.

Note: On some of the specimens examined, the apex of
the 'A' projects to the right.

III 'S' of'SLA' is misshapen at the bottom.

Note: On some of the specimens examined, this does not
appear.

IV On '£' of 'ECT, at the bottom the colour projects
upwards in the form of a dot.
V In the left value disc:
(a) the colour projects on to the left of the oblique
stroke about a third of the way up; and
(b) on the left of the bar, there is a coloured dot.
VI On the left side of the right mountain, several lines
of shading are missing.
Note: On some of the specimens examined, this does not
appear.

\subsection{Type 3}

I Above '' of 'ISH', the colour projects upwards into
the curved white space and also downwards into the top of
the right vertical stroke of the 'H
'II In the'right value disc:

(a) at the top, the colour projects upwards;

(b) the *7' is blunted at the top; and

(c) there are several coloured dots on the oblique stroke.
III On '' of 'NDS', there is a coloured dot below the
central aperture.

IV In the left value disc, the oblique stroke is shorter
than the one in the right value disc.


\section{Type 4}

I The middle shell* below the canoe is more broken on the
left than normal and the adjacent lines of shading are
faulty.

II Above 'AN' of 'AND', the curved coloured line and
the colour below are joined by an oblique coloured stroke.

III The apex of 'A' of 'ATE' is speckled with coloured
dots.

IV Below 'S' and below TA' of 'STA', the colour
projects downwards into the white space above the inner
frame line.

V In the right value disc:

(a) the oblique stroke is shorter than the one in the left
value disc; and

(b) the stroke bulges about a third of the way up.
VI Between the two value discs, the extreme right
ornament, in the row of ten, is broken or weak.

VII In the left value disc, there is a projection of colour
on the left.

VIII In the south-west corner, the outer frame line is
weak or broken.

*Note: The three shells were intended by C. M. Woodford
to represent those of the pearl, the turtle and the snail,
so H. G. D. Gisburn states.

All three were items of commerce in the islands.


\subsection{Type 5}
I On 'N' of 'NDS\ nearly half the way up on the left
vertical stroke, there is a white projection to the left.

II In the south-west corner, the vertical inner frame line
is broken between the two leaves.

III Between the two values discs, the third ornament from
the left, in the row often, projects downwards on the left.


\section{Type 6}

I In the right value disc:
(a) the colour projects upwards into the base of the'!'; and

(b) there is a coloured dot on the right side of the T, a
third of the way down.

II The right side of the right vertical stroke of 'H' of
'ISH' is uneven.

\section{Paper and gum}

The unwatermarked paper, its texture and the gum are identical with those of the lower denominations in the Large Canoe Issue.

\section{Colour}

Bright purple is the colour of the 1/- value. But, when the Large Canoe Issue was replaced by the Small Canoe Issue, the colour of the 1/- was changed to black-green, in conformity with the UPU requirements.

\section{Perforations}
Only small hole perforations (Pll) are known for the 1/- value.
No specimens, imperforate between vertically or horizontally, have been recorded.

\section{Unauthorised imperforate reprints}

There exist in the I/- denomination, on thick art paper, imperforate reprints (or 'proofs', as they have
improperly been described) but they were printed secretly and were never issued by authority.

C. M. Woodford's warning about them and his explanation as to how they were fraudulently produced are given in THE LONDON PHILATELIST, Vol 81, No 959, p 218.

\section{Forgeries}

These exist for the I/- value and how to detect them will be found in THE LONDON PHILATELIST, Vol 86, Nos 1011-12, p 39.

\section{Minor varieties}

Minor varieties seen on certain positions on the sheet are listed in the Appendix.
Where such minor varieties have been proved to be constant, they are printed in bold type but, owing to the lack of sufficient plated specimens in the highest denomination, ie the 1/-, confirmation has been hampered.

LP1055 for appendix of more minor errors.
