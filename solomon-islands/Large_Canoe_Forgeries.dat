\chapter{Forgeries}

The way to differentiate forgeries of the Large Canoe from genuine stamps is summarised
in Appendix C which H. G. Leslie Fletcher has courteously checked and amplified.
Along with forgeries that exist of the other values of the First Issue, all are crude lithographs.

Although some of these forgeries were attributed to Fournier by Gisburn, no evidence
to that effect has so far been found.7 nor is it likely that the forgeries were made by Sperati, because the standard of workmanship is not high enough. My own suspicion is that they could have been made by Panelli.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The extreme right paddle touches the shore.

\item  Type differences are absent.

\item  The right leg of 'R' in 'BRITISH' is pointed.

\item The lettering and figures are irregular.

\item  In the two scrolls, there are four instead of five curved
coloured lines: the left scroll is faulty.

\item The ends of the canoe are less tapered and the men are
more blurred.

\item  Above 'POSTAGE', instead of groups of three coloured
vertical strokes, there is an irregular line of white
horizontal gaps in the colour.

\item  The colour of the forgeries is a dull, bluish grey.

\item Although specimens perforated 11 exist, most of the forgeries are perforated 11 \half.
