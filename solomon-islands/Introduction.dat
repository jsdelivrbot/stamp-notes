## Solomon Islands


The Solomon Islands are a collection of nearly one thousand islands in Oceania that form a sovereign country. They lie to the east of Papua New Guinea in Melanesia and cover a land area of 28,400 square kilometres (11,000 sq mi). The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal.

The first mails from the islands are believed to be those sent by the British Resident Commissioner, Charles Woodford, who was appointed in 1896 and established an administrative centre at Tulagi. Letters were sent in a sealed bag to Sydney where [New South Wales](../new-south-wales/Introduction) stamps were affixed. Later, a stock of New South Wales was kept at Tulagi and the stamps were cancelled in Sydney. From April 1906, Woodford used a paid handstamp instead and stamps were again added in Sydney.

Great Britain'S acquisition of its Pacific island territories has been accomplished
from mixed motives. It began with \ilink[Pitcairn]{../Pitcairn/introduction}, with no idea of political expansion (quite the reverse in fact); others, such as Fiji, were acquired at the express wish of their peoples, and in the case of the Solomon Islands it was to bring law and order to a territory which could then only be described as a festering sore.

For many years up to 1893 the islands had been the resort of the "blackbirders";
ostensibly "recruiters" of native labour for the plantations of Queensland and Fiji, but
in reality little better than out-and-out slave raiders. Resistance on the part of the fierce
Melanesians led to such a state, of lawlessness and bloodshed that, to protect the peaceful
white traders and missionaries, a British protectorate was declared over the southern
islands in 1893, with later additions (by agreement with Germany) in 1900.

The obvious choice for appointment as first Resident Commissioner was Charles
Woodford, who had spent many years in exploring the group, and whose book, A Naturalist
Among the Head Hunters, is a classic in its field. Woodford commenced his task in 1896,
and on behalf of the Government purchased the small island of Tulagi (situated under
the lee of the large Florida Island) from a native chief. Here was set up the capital and
administrative headquarters of the Protectorate.

Up to this time no postal service existed; letters from the scattered mission and trading
stations being handed to the crews or passengers of passing vessels for posting when
opportunity permitted. This arrangement had been both irregular and uncertain, and one
of Woodford's first tasks was to organise a systematic postal service. In the early days
he kept at this own expense a supply of New South Wales stamps for use by the residents;
later he collected the postage in cash and remitted his own cheque with the mails despatched
to Sydney, where letters were stamped and forwarded. For some years he pressed the
authorities to provide a definitive series of stamps for the Protectorate; finding his efforts
unavailing he designed the first series himself (the well-known and philatelically interesting
"Large Canoe" issue) and had them printed at Sydney. Belatedly, when it was found
that the stamps were both useful and profitable, they were recognised by the Colonial
Office, and later by the Universal Postal Union.

More important than the provision of the actual stamps was the establishment of post
offices at necessary points. The G.P.O. at Tulagi was opened in 1907, coincident (as it
happened) with the first day of sale of the new stamps. This oflice acted as administrative
centre up to the time of the Japanese invasion in 1942, when its functions were transferred
temporarily to Lunga on Guadalcanal; it was later re-opened as a sub-office on May 20,
1946. and finally closed on March 31, 1949.
Early in the life of the Protectorate a station was established at Gizo, a small island
between Kolombangara and Ganongga in the northern sector; comprising a branch of
Messrs. Burns, Philp & Co., Ltd.. and a local headquarters of Messrs. Lever Brothers'
Pacific Plantations Ltd. for their Western Estates. A post office was opened at Gizo in
1907; it was abandoned at the time of the Japanese occupation, declared officially closed
on April 1, 1946, but again re-opened in 1950, and is still functioning.
Burns, Philp and Lever stations were also established at Faisi on Shortland Island,
off the southern tip of Bougainville Island (then part of German New Guinea). A post
office was opened at Faisi in 1907, the official designation (and consequent postal cancellation,
however, being "Shortland Island." This also was overrun by the Japanese, and
was later declared closed as from April 1, 1946. Another headquarters of Messrs. Lever
was opened at Aola, on the eastern shore of Guadalcanal, and a post office established
there in 1908. It was closed about 1912, re-opened on October 21, 1916, and finally closed
(so far as is known) somewhere about 1919.
In 1906 the Australian Government, concerned at the influx of black labour from the
Pacific and its consequences (as typified in the former Confederate States of America),
introduced its "White Australia" legislation. Under this, all black labour in the Commonwealth
had to be repatriated to their homes. Thousands of Solomon Islanders were then
working on the Queensland plantations, and Messrs. Burns, Philp secured the contract
for the conveyance of these natives (a species of "blackbirding" in reverse) to the Protectorate.

The islanders were transported in Burns, Philp vessels to a central "decanting
station" on the island of Gavutu, about three miles from Tulagi, a local headquarters
of Messrs. Lever Bros. From this point the latter company undertook the inter-island
conveyance to the respective villages of the deportees.
The local staff of Messrs. Levers were almost exclusively engaged in this work during
the year 1907, and the consequent business and increase of staff was the reason for the
opening in that year of a post office at Gavutu. This, incidentally, gave rise to the rarest
postmark of the Protectorate, the temporary use of the large oval rubber stamp inscribed
"L.P.P.L. Gavotu" (so spelt) pending the arrival of a permanent datestamp. This office
was closed, so far as can be ascertained, in 1914.

In 1924 operations were commenced in the distant Santa Cruz group by the Australian
Kauri Timber Company, with headquarters at Vanikoro. To meet the requirements of
the personnel engaged there a post office was opened on July 1, 1924. It was closed down
on October 20, 1944, and mail from the Santa Cruz Islands is now being dealt with at
Kira-Kira on San Cristobal Island.

When the G.P.O. at Tulagi was transferred to Guadalcanal in 1943 it was temporarily
housed in a thatched hut on the banks of the Tenerau River, some five miles east of
Lunga Beach, the latter being the headquarters of the American forces. The G.P.O. was
re-opened here on July 17, 1943, and lasted until May 20, 1946, when it was re-established
under its present name of Honiara, the new capital of the Protectorate and now also
administrative headquarters of the Western Pacific High Commission.

One of the principal American bases on the islands was at Munda Point, on the island
of New Georgia. A Protectorate post office was opened at Munda on April 15, 1944,
and closed down on March 31, 1949. Consequent upon the postal reorganisation of May
1946, a new office was opened at Auki on the western shore of Malaita Island, and this
is still in operation. The three post offices now functioning are therefore Honiara, Auki,
and Gizo.

Postal agencies have also been established at Kira-Kira on San Cristobal Island and
at Yandina (Russell Islands), the latter being a halt for the QANTAS E.A. 'planes on
the air route from Sydney. Since January 1952 Yandina has made up direct mails for
Sydney by air, and stamps have been provisionally cancelled in manuscript. Both Kira-
Kira and Yandina, however, are to be supplied with permanent obliterators.

These brief notes merely cover the "lives" of the various post offices, and may therefore
be of interest to students of the Protectorate's stamps and postal history. Each office has given rise to a number of interesting postal cancellations, provisional and otherwise,
which I have not attempted to cover in these present notes.
