\section{Plating the 1d Value}

Paucity of suitable material has made the study of the 1d Large Canoe a less easy
task than the re-plating of the lowest denomination (Jd), the results of which have
already appeared in THE LONDON PHILATELIST.

Determining and recording the constant type varieties of the six different types of
the Id value have presented no problems because ample specimens exist.
Where the difficulty has arisen was in obtaining sufficient and convincing corroboration
of the minor varieties that may prove to be constant on the sixty stamps on the
complete sheet.

For, whereas in the investigation of the \half d value, four complete sheets were available for study, only one complete sheet of the Id has been under scrutiny.
Other specialists and collectors consulted have only been able to produce strips of
six, blocks, pairs, etc and this section of the research has accordingly been based on
the following items:

The author expresses his gratitude to those who made this material available.
Additionally, access has been had to various shorter strips, blocks, pairs and singles
of the Id value, the respective sheet numbers of which are unknown.
Furthermore, grateful appreciation is expressed for the helpful advice of J. B.
Marriott, Keeper of the Collection of HM the Queen, in whose collection there is a
strip of six of the Id value.

CONSTANT TYPE VARIETIES

Each horizontal row of the 1d value has six distinct types, namely:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 repeated vertically in each of the ten rows of the sheet.
Enlargements of these six types (Figures 1-6), numbered from left to right and kindly
provided by D. H. Geach, are shown (see page 230).

Set out below are details of the constant type varieties found in these six different
types, the three most noticeable characteristics of each type being indicated in italics.

\subsection{Type 1}
The most prominent varieties are the first three


I On 'P' of 'PRO', low down, there is a coloured
mark.

U The left value disc has, on the left, a coloured
dash inside the outer coloured circle.

III Below 'AN' of 'AND', the curved line of
white spaces is not continuous.

IV South-west of the right scroll, the colour
projects towards the inner vignette line.

V Above 'RI' of 'KIT, there is a projection or
thickening of the outer frame line.

VI T of 'ISH' is uneven on the right.

VII Above 'IS' of 'ISL', the colour projects
upwards.

VIII In the right value disc, on the south-west,
the edge of the colour is uneven.

IX South-east of the right value disc, there is a coloured dot just below the horizontal innerframe line.

X Above 'ST of 'STA', the line of colour projects obliquely downwards into the nearest
white space.

\subsection{Type 2}

I On 'O' of 'OLO', on the left, there is a curved
coloured flaw.

II South-west of 'P' of 'POS', two horizontal
lines of shading are broken, leaving a white flaw.

III The lower loop of 'S' of 'STA' is sliced off
on the right.

IV On the left of 'B' of 'BRF, the colour at the
point of the scroll is blunted.

V Below 'N' of 'NDS', the curved line of white
spaces ends in a projection of colour.

VI 'R' of 'ROT' has a faulty right leg.

VII South-west of the right scroll, a bulge of
the colour almost touches the inner vignette line.

VIII In the left value disc:

(i) there is a coloured dot inside the northeast
lug of the outer coloured circle, and

(ii) on the south-west, the edge of the colour
is uneven.

IX In the right value disc:

(i) the right foot of T is broken;

(ii) the top of 'd' slants sharply to the left; and

(Hi) on the north-east, the colour projects.

\subsection{Type 3}
I Above 'O' of 'OMO', a wavy coloured stroke
joins the colour to the curved coloured line above.
II Across three of the right palms, there is an
oblique white flaw.
HI The vertical outer frame line is broken near
the south-west and south-east corners.
IV The first T of TIT is nicked on the right.
V T of 'ISL' has a faulty left foot.
VI In the left value disc:
(i) on the south-west, the edge of the colour
is uneven; and
(ii) below the T, a coloured dot touches the
edge of the coloured disc.
VII In the right value disc, the sloping top of
the T is wider and longer than the top in the
left value disc.

\subsection{Type 4}

I On 'T of 'TIS', near the foot, there is a
'tadpole-shaped' coloured flaw.

II Above 'N' of 'MON', a slanting coloured
stroke joins the colour to the curved coloured line
above.

III Opposite the further shore line, on the right,
the inner vignette line is broken.

IV The first T of TIT has a white projection
on the left.

V Above 'IS' of 'ISH', the colour projects
upwards.

VI Above the first 'O' of 'OMO', the curved
coloured line above projects downwards.

VII In the left value disc, on the south-west,
the edge of the colour is uneven.

VIII In the right value disc, on the south-east,
there is a faint coloured dot inside the inner
coloured circle.

\subsection{Type 5}

I Below 'T' of 'TAG', the colour bulges downwards.

II In the north-west comer, the outer frame line
is broken.

III North-west of 'B' of 'SRI', the colour
projects upwards.

IV 'B' of 'BRT has a coloured dot at the foot,
is uneven on the left and has the upper loop
nicked.

V The loop of the 'R' of 'KIT is misshapen on
the right.

VI Above 'S' of 'ISH', there are two upward
projections of the colour.

VH On 'S' of 'SOL', the lower loop has one
(or two) coloured dots.

VIII Above 'OL' of 'OLO', the edge of the
colour is uneven.

IX In the south-east corner, there is a coloured
dot inside the outer frame line.

X The lower loop of'S' of 'STA' is faulty.

\subsection{Type 6}
I Below the left scroll, there is a massive
coloured blob.

II On the right of that blob, between the outer
and inner vignette lines, there is a coloured mark.

III In the south-east corner, the horizontal inner
frame line is broken.

IV Below 'P' of 'PpS', there is a coloured flaw
on the outer frame line.

V In the left value disc, there is a coloured dot
on the T.

( is not visible on No 54.)

VI The left leg of 'R' of 'ROT' is faulty.

VII Above 'B' of 'BRT, there is a white
projection downwards into the colour.

(It is not visible on Nos 30 and 36.)

VIII In the south-east corner, there is a
coloured dot inside the vertical outer frame line.

General Note

Examples of 'AN' of 'AND' being joined at the
foot, or nearly so, are numerous.
But as they are not limited to any one type,
they cannot be included as a constant type
variety.

While the remainder of the constant type varieties that are listed may not be needed
for identification, it is essential to enumerate them, as otherwise they could be confused
with the minor varieties found on individual stamps, many of which minor varieties
are likely to be proved to be constant.

The more extensive knowledge resulting from this research that is now available to
specialists can be summarised thus:

Some of these constant type varieties are less easily detected than those imperfections
that are shown in italic type but knowledge of their existence is essential if they are
not to be mistaken for minor varieties attributable to individual stamps on the sheet.

CONSTANT MINOR VARIETIES

Publication of the minor varieties believed to be constant on each of the sixty stamps
on the 1d sheet could have been deferred until further material became available for
examination, but, by making known the conclusions so far reached, others may be
encouraged to participate in this research.

been under scrutiny and that, while every attempt has been made to confirm the
findings on that sheet, there are some positions where confirmation has not proved
possible at this stage.

In an Appendix, to be published in the December number of THE LONDON
PHILATELIST, are the interim results based on complete sheet No 63 and checked,
wherever possible, from this material.
For easy reference, the tabulation is arranged by types, ie, under Type 1 are shown
the minor varieties found in positions: 1, 7, 13, 19 25, 31, 37, 43, 49 and 55 on the
sheet.

Although in Gisburn's book, constant minor varieties are cited for only nineteen
positions on the sheet, the Appendix gives varieties (many of which may prove to be
constant) for every position on the complete sheet of sixty stamps.
As with all other denominations of the Large Canoe Issue, there was only one plate
for the 1d.

The colour was rose-carmine. As only one printing took place, such shades as are
found are due to exposure to sunlight and are not attributable to separate printings.
All previous remarks regarding paper, gum, perforations, alleged proofs, forgeries
and so on apply equally to the seven values in this issue and repetition is accordingly
unnecessary.

Finally, until further corroboration is forthcoming on the minor varieties of the Id,
preparation of a key to plating would be premature.
The help of G. H. Geach in checking these results is acknowledged with gratitude.
