\chapter{The 2\half d Large Canoe}


NONE of the specialists consulted was found to possess a complete sheet, half a sheet or even a large
block of the 2\half d denomination. But fortunately quite a few horizontal strips of six stamps exist and it
is upon these, as well as upon smaller blocks and strips, pairs, and singles of ascertainable positions, that
the current study has been based.

It has been easy to determine which of the varieties attributable to the different types in the 2\half d
denominations are constant, because the distinguishing features are so unmistakable.
Much difficulty, however, has been experienced in ascertaining whether or not certain minor varieties
found in individual positions are constant, as confirmation has been inhibited or impracticable due to the limited quantity or absence of appropriate material.

In the year of issue, namely 1907, complete sheets of all seven denominations were examined in London, because in a current philatelic publication1 it is stated:'. . . but having had an opportunity of examining entire sheets, we think it well to describe their little peculiarities before they are broken up...'

The article went on to say:'... in any case one ought to make a note of everything that one can find . . .' but the findings that were recorded are, alas, incomplete.

\section{Quantity}

1,000 sheets of the 2£d value, each consisting of ten horizontal rows of six stamps, were printed and
issued on 14 February 1907.

On 16 March 1908, due to some of the sheets having become stuck together, 4,572 stamps of that
denomination were officially destroyed at sea by being sunk in a weighted tin box.
On 1 December 1908, a further 936 stamps of that value were officially destroyed by fire at Tulagi,
followed by the destruction on 23 March 1909 of 707 sheets, ie, 42,420, of the 2|d stamps, as the subsequent
issue of the Small Canoe stamps had by then become available.
The number of the 2£d denomination put into circulation was thus 12,072.2
Colour, paper, etc
The 2\half d stamp is orange-yellow in colour and, as with other values in this issue, the paper used was an unwatermarked, thickish, coarse-textured, white wove paper. A thick white gum, which sometimes has become discoloured, was used.

They were produced by lithography and the circumstances under which constant type varieties and
constant minor varieties occur have been described previously.3

\section{Perforate and imperforate}
Although two single-line machines gauging 11, one making small holes and the other large holes, were available during the printing of the Large Canoe Issue, the perforations on the 2\half d value are all small holes.

No specimens imperforate on all four sides are recorded but specimens are known imperforate on the top margin, imperforate on the right-hand margin and imperforate on the bottom margin.

There is illustrated a pair from the Perazzo Collection (Figure 1) imperforate horizontally between the fourth and fifth horizontal rows.

The William Frazer collection had an example from the top of the sheet with the variety imperforate between (Figure~\ref{frazer-01}) and a block of four showing imperforate between pairs. Both varieties have are catalogued by Stanley Gibbons as SG 4a nad 4b respectively. The block was sold above its at the time catalogue value.

\section{Constant type varieties}
As with the \half d denomination, there are only three different types in the 2\half d value, repeated in each horizontal row twice thus:
1 2 3 1 2 3

(All the other values in the Large Canoe Issue have six types)
There appear as Figures 3, 4, and 5 enlargements kindly supplied by D. H. Geach, on which the respective constant type varieties may be identified.
Set out below are details of the constant type varieties now revealed by this research, which differ from, and are more numerous than, those mentioned in Gisburn's book.

These constant type varieties are so distinct that the first description in each case suffices for type identification but the other constant type varieties need to be enumerated lest inadvertently they be regarded as constant minor varieties attributable to particular positions on the sheet.

Constant type varieties

\subsection{Typel}
I In the left value disc:
(i the fraction bar is missing; and
(ii) the upright stroke of the 'd' is faulty and it leans to
the left.

II In the right value disc:
(i) the serif of 7' is larger than normal;
(ii) the fraction bar is faint; and
(Hi) the foot of the large '2' slopes upwards on the right
and is thinner than the one in the left value disc

\subsection{Type 2}
/ A coloured flaw on the right-hand slope of the left-hand
mountain.
II A coloured dot between the two vignette lines, halfway
up on the left side.
III On the right of 'AGE', the lines of shading are blurred
over with colour.
IV Above 'IS' of 'ISL', the colour projects slightly
upwards.

NOTE

Although Gisburn gives as a Type 2 constant type variety:

(a) the upstroke of the 'd' is straight in each value disc;
and
(b) the bar underneath is in the correct position;
such characteristics are not included here because those
features are normal.

\subsection{Type 3}

The colour is missing on the uppermost left frond of the
palms on the right.
H The right leg of 'R' of 'KIT is shortened.

\section{Minor varieties}

In Appendix B details are given of the minor varieties found in the limited amount of material so far
examined.
At this stage, only those varieties shown in bold type are known to be constant minor varieties. Other minor varieties mentioned may prove to be constant if adequate confirmation is forthcoming.

However, as stated in the previous article, it is hoped that other specialists will be encouraged by the publication of these interim results to co-operate in completing this research.
