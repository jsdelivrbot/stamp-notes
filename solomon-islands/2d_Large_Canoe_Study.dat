\chapter{2d Large Canoe Postage Stamp}

Most of the work outlined in this study is attributed to F.B.HOWARD-WHITE, MC who published his results in the London Philatelist. The Hooward-White collection was later dispersed in 1985. 

READERS WILL RECALL that for the Large Canoe issue lithography was chosen as
the method of printing because it is quick and inexpensive.
The value tablets on the original die having been left blank, transfers were prepared for
each value, put on to an intermediate stone and the value added.\sidenote{British Solomon Islands Protectorate: \textit{Its Postage Stamps and Postal History}. H. G. D. Gisburn, 1956.}

2d Large Canoe

For the 2d denomination, a transfer was made from this intermediate stone to the printing
stone in strips of six transfer papers. Each reproduction in this horizontal strip of six
diners from the others. These varieties in type, which are constant, are then repeated
vertically in the remaining nine rows that go to make up the complete sheet of sixty stamps.

Enlargements of each of these six types, kindly prepared by D. H. Geach, are illustrated
(Figures 1-6). Indigo is the colour in which the 2d Large Canoe was printed.
No problems have arisen in ascertaining the constant type varieties of the six types in the
2d value, inasmuch as an extensive supply of unplated specimens is avilable. Careful
corroboration has now established the following.

As compared with two Type 1 constant type varieties mentioned by H. G. D. Gisburn1,
details of four constant type varieties in Type 1 revealed by the present research are described below.

In the case of Type 2 constant type varieties, of which two only are listed by Gisburn,
particulars of nine constant type varieties for Type 2 exist.

As against Gisburn's citation of two abnormalities in Type 3, details of ten constant
type varieties in Type 3 have now been established.

For Type 4, Gisburn alludes to only one constant type variety, whereas six such varieties
have been found in the current study.

Two constant type varieties are attributed by Gisburn to Type 5, as compared with
twelve of which details are given below.

Finally, eight constant type varieties occur in Type 6, as compared with three enumerated
by Gisburn.
