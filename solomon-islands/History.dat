\section{Discovery of the Islands}

In 1567-8 Alvaro de Mendana sailed westwards across the Pacific to discover, explore
and name a substantial part of the eastern half of the islands which were shortly afterwards to become popularly known as the Islands of Solomon.

He did so in a spirit of colonialism, commercialism, Catholic proselytism and romantic
curiosity, against a background of supposition and belief that the South Pacific . . . contained
a vast austral continent, the Ophir of King Solomon, the lands reported by Marco
Polo and golden islands reputed to have been known to the Incas.'

Those words, quoted from Colin Jack-Hinton's scholarly and authoritative work,
succinctly describe when, where and why the sixteenth-century Spanish explorers' quest
for these islands began.1

Albeit that the documents anent that exploration ante-date by several centuries the
advent of the postal historian, the following are translations from photostats courteously
supplied by the Archive General de Indias in Sevilla.

' ... the Catholic King Don Felipe II, then reigning in Spain, and His Excellency Senor
Lope Garcia de Castro then governing the Kingdoms of Peru in his name.

\begin{blockquote}
The inhabitants of this country worship serpents toads, and other animals. There complexion is bronze, their hair wooly: and they wear no covering but around the waist. they subsist on cocoa nuts, and a sort of root which they call Venaus. They eat no flesh, and are ignorant of teh use of fermented liquors, they have therefore a clearer complexion than those first seen. But there is no room to doubt that they are cannibals: the Cacique sent, as a present to Mendana, a quarter child, having the hand and arm upon it. The Spanish general caused it to be buried in the presence of those who had brought it, who seemed offended and confused at the bad success of their embassy, and retired hanging down their heads.
\end{blockquote}

The Governor Lope Garcia de Castro ordered sails to be hoisted in two navy vessels
in order to discover certain islands and land which His Majesty the Catholic King Don
Felipe II had ordered should be carried out, since many mathematicians had said these
islands and lands must exist there.
Following this order, Alvaro de Mendana, his nephew, was named General and Captain
of the said fleet...'

'Those taking part in this voyage of war over the sea were four franciscan monks and
100 persons. . . .

Everything was so much in our favour that we soon reached a latitude of twelve and a
half degrees.'

Although the name of the ship that carried this missive has not been recorded, the identity of the courier has been revealed in these words:

'Don Fernando Henriquez left for the city of the Kings in order to inform them of this
good news.'

The venture thus began led to the discovery of the archipelago first to appear on charts
as the Insulae Salamonis or the Islas de Salomon.\index{Islad de Salomon}

Limitations of space preclude fuller details being given of the first voyage or of Mendana's
ill-fated second expedition in 1595, during which he died.2
As century succeeded century, the perilous passages and reefs of this archipelago came
to be explored by many gallant and skilled navigators but the Ophir whence King Solomon
obtained his gold yet remains to be identified.

\section{Genesis of the postal history}

What is believed to be the genesis of the postal history of the Solomon Islands is an entire
that was found quite recently among a cache of correspondence from the Pacific Ocean.
The writer was Captain James E. Bunker, Master of the whaling vessel Harriet.
The letter is dated 8 March 1834 and states that the whaler, after passing through Japanese
waters, had reached Santa Cruz Island (Lat 10°50' S, Long 165° 40' E), bound towards
the Navigator Islands.
Addressed to the owners:
Clay & Son, Salvador House, Bishopsgate Street, London,
it reports that the Harriet had been in no port since leaving Moahoo in May 1833. It gives
a graphic description of adventures and hardships at sea, stating that off Bougainville
Island a savage attack by natives in canoes had taken place.
In those days, whalers used to start from the coast of Japan and then work their way
down through the Solomon archipelago to Antarctica and the Bay of Whales, finishing
up at Auckland in New Zealand for refitting.
Postal markings are:

DOVER

INDIA LETTER

enclosed in a black rectangle (18x64mm). A red cds (London):

7 NO 7
1834

There are two undercipherable markings, possibly charge marks, in black ink across the
face of the entire.

Written by hand, in black ink, crosswise on the entire are:

'Off the Island Santa Cruz\\
8 March 1834\\
James E. Bunker\\
Received - 7 November 1834'\\

There is a red wax seal showing a head in profile.


\section{The Marist missionaries}

The headquarters of the Roman Catholic French Society of Mary are now in Rome and
all its historic records have been preserved with praiseworthy care.3
For the period 1845-50, there are no less than sixty-nine documents from the Solomon
Islands. The majority are not of philatelic interest but, through the courtesy of the Society,
the following details have been taken from photographs of the earliest entires showing
postal markings.
In 1845, Bishop Jean-Baptiste Epalle and a party of missionaries sailed from New Zealand
and, after calling en route at New Caledonia, arrived at Thousand Ships Bay in Santa
Ysabel Island on 12 December. Landing unarmed, the Bishop and his companions were
savagely attacked by the natives and from his wounds the Bishop died.
A vivid account of that massacre is contained in an entire dated 31 December 1845
written by Xavier Montrouzier to his brother in France. Postal markings are:
MS 1 decime MS St Felix.
Double cds 25 NOV 46 LYON (33)
Double cds 26 NOV 46 MONTPELLIER (33)
Double cds 27 NOV 46 CLERMONT DE L'HERAULT (33)
Oval handstamp. Rural 1 decime due.
The next letter, written on 5 January 1846 by Leopold Verguet to Fr Colin in France,
shows no postal markings. It accompanied sundry sketches Verguet had made which,
presumably because of their bulk, had personally to be taken by someone sailing for
Europe.

Then comes an entire sent on 30 January 1846 by Xavier Montrouzier to his parents in
France. It has these postal markings:

MS 1 decime.

Double cds 25 NOV 46 LYON (33)\\
Double cds 26 NOV 46 MONTPELLIER (33)\\
Double cds 27 NOV 46 CLERMONT DE L'HERAULT (33)\\
Oval handstamp. Rural 1 decime due.\\

These postal markings prove that this entire accompanied the entire that Montrouzier
wrote to his brother on 31 December 1845.

The next document showing postal markings is an entire written from Sydney on 14
March 1848 by P. Villien to Fr Colin and of which the details are as follows:4

After 1852, the Marist missionaries in Melanesia were succeeded by the Milan Foreign
Mission Society which withdrew in 1855.

The Marist missionaries did not return to the British Solomons until 1898 and to the
German Solomons in 1899.

Bishop Patteson's letters
Described as 'a good, a brave, a God-fearing and a God-loving man', the name of John
Coleridge Patteson5 will for ever be associated with the Solomon Islands.
Born in 1827, he became the first Bishop of Melanesia but alas was murdered by natives
at Nukapu in 1871.
A descendant of the Bishop having deposited all his letters with the SPG (now The
United Society for the Propagation of the Gospel) in London, enquiries were made in
case they could contribute to the postal history of the Solomon Islands.
The archivist of that Society has courteously made a search but reports that all the
Bishop's letters were enclosed in envelopes which no longer are there.6 Of entires there are
none and hence no postal markings.

\section{The Resident Commissioner's postbag}

Charles Morris Woodford, born at Gravesend in 1852, now enters the story.7
After serving in the Fiji Immigration Department early in the eighties, he sought adventure by spending several years fearlessly roving about in the cannibal-infested Solomon archipelago, collecting specimens for the Rothschild Natural History Museum at Tring Park.

\end{figure*}

Despite the hair-raising experiences among the head-hunters that he describes in his
fascinating book, he said that he knew no place where firm and paternal government would
sooner produce beneficial results than in the Solomon Island.

Woodford also set about reconstructing Mendana's two explorations, using a translation
of the narrative of Catoira, chief purser to Mendana, and Woodford's meritorious papers
published in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society were recognised by the
award of the Gil Memorial medal.
