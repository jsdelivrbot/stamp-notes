\chapter{Kangaroo Issues Introduction}   
 
High values of the Kangaroo and Map stamps include values of 5/-, 10/-, £1 and £2. 
These are primarily bicolor stamps. Because of their limited use and low quantities produced, 
they might be out of reach of many budgets.

As mentioned earlier, the low values are still very affordable. The penny values are very inexpensive and can be acquired in quantity and on cover at very modest cost.
The first job a collector must face in collecting the Aussie 'Roos is identifying the stamps 
by catalog number.

In the United States, most collectors use and are familiar with the Scott catalog. 
Aussie 'Roo stamps are listed in both Vol. 1 of the Standard Postage Stamp 
Catalogue and in the Classic Specialized Catalogue of Stamps and Covers 1840-1940. 
These are certainly adequate for basic identification and cataloging.

Specialists will want the highly detailed listings contained in Brusden White's Australian 
Commonwealth Specialist Catalogue, which devotes 100 pages to the 'Roos.
Beginners often agonize over identifying watermarks on Australia stamps.
Watermarks are designs impressed into the paper during its manufacture and serve 
as a security device.

The first three Australian watermarks, shown in Figure 1, do resemble one another 
fairly closely. With practice, most collectors will be able to quickly discern the differences.

The Australian watermarks designated by Scott as Nos. 8, 9 and 10 are similar to 
each other in appearance. Watermark 8 has a large, wide crown perched on top of
 a wide "A." The orb and cross at the top of the crown rest on a straight line that 
connects two triangles.

Watermark 9 has another wide crown, but it rests on a narrower "A." The orb and 
cross on the top of the crown rest in a gully between two points on the crown.
Watermark 10 is similar to watermark 8 in the design of the crown, except that both 
the crown and the "A" are much narrower. I find the easiest comparison point to 
be the band at the bottom of the crown, which is significantly different between 
watermarks 8 and 10.

Two other watermark designs can be found on 'Roo stamps, but they do not 
cause collectors too much difficulty
They are Scott watermark No. 203, an allover pattern of alternating small 
crowns and the letter "A"; and Scott watermark No. 228, an allover pattern 
of alternating small crowns and the letters "C of A" (for Commonwealth of Australia).
The whole watermarking task becomes much less confusing when you look at Table 1, 
which shows which stamp values appear with the various watermarks.
Some good news is that the watermarks on Australian stamps are almost always 
discernable without the use of watermark fluid.

Try placing the stamps face down in your watermark tray or on a piece of 
black paper. Odds are good that you will be able to see the watermark plainly. 
If not, you can always use watermark fluid to see the watermark.
