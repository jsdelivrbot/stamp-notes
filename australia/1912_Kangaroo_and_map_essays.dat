\chapter{1912 Kangaroo and Map Essays} 
The 1911 Exhibition entry that was awarded third place featured the Australian Arms,
an idea that was later on used for the 1950 Arms series. Essays by Blamire Young and
described by Chapman<sup>1</sup> were considered, but unfortunately unadopted.
(Figure 1) illustrates the original essays as described by Chapman in his 1985 presentation to the Royal Society. The essays he displayed were 3d, 1d 9d, 1s and 20s.
Probably the last value was intended to be used as revenues.

There are a total of nine recorded First Essays in seven different denominations based on this design, of which five were acquired (amazingly as one lot in the 1981 Williamson auction in London) by R.T.P. Chapman, whose collection was subsequently acquired intact by the Australia Post. Figures 2,3 and 4, show three out of the remaining four that are still in private hands.


\ph[40%]{../australia/roo-essay-monochrome.jpg}{1912 Type 1 (Horizontal Format with the Map Superimposed upon the Royal Standard and Australian Flag) Essay for a 2\halfd value in bright blue on thick ungummed unwatermarked paper roughly rouletted perce en scie 14 1/2 BW #KE2, excellent colour, well centred, very fresh, minor surface crack at lower-left is evident only on close inspection and in no way affects the very fine appearance, undercatalogued at $75,000 (2004). Ex Dr Abramovitch (whose magnificent collection was dispersed privately by Sydney dealer Max Cohen in the early 1970s). One of the most important items of Australian philately, and offered at auction for the first time. In fact, we are not aware of any Type 1 essay ever having been offered at public auction in Australia. (The last time a Type 1 essay was offered was at the Williamson auction in London in 1981: five different examples were sold as one lot! They were bought by Ray Chapman whose collection was later acquired intact by Australia Post.) The ACSC acknowledges that these five different Type 1's are in the Australia Post Archival Collection. Only four further examples are recorded as being in private hands, and it has been speculated that one of these may have been lost. It can be argued that this 2\halfd example is the best or most desirable of these. It is one of only two "perforated" monocolour essays in private hands. And it presents most attractively. (It should be noted that the so-called "bicolour" types, in fact, are monocolour designs over which a central vignette in the second colour has been affixed.) THIS ITEM IS OF INCOMPARABLE IMPORTANCE FOR ANYONE INTENDING TO EXHIBIT "KANGAROOS". The origin of the Kangaroo & Map design is still, after 94 years, a highly contentious subject. The ACSC states that the kangaroo motif was adapted from Herman Altmann's prize-winning competition entry entitled "Baldy's Roo" (now thought to be lost). However, in the 1920s, Blamire Young - whose status as "the" designer has now been refuted - asserted in a letter to the Philatelic Society of Victoria that "The kangaroo was mine". As none of Young's commissioned designs has survived, this statement cannot be directly disputed: however, it is notable that Young laid no claim to the development of the progressive essays or final design. The statement in the ACSC that "All these essays were letterpress printed from zinc line-blocks by Rudolph Steel of Melbourne" is generally accepted as accurate. At least some commentators believe that Steel was also responsible for the progressive designs, and there is strong evidence that he "perforated" the perce en scie items. THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY FOR A QUARTER-CENTURY TO ACQUIRE AN EXAMPLE OF THE FIRST PRINTED ESSAYS FOR THE KANGAROO AND MAP STAMPS. While we rarely comment about the estimates in our catalogues, we believe it is appropriate to do so on this occasion. Even five years ago the market for rare Australian stamps was still in its infancy. Extremely rare items changed hands for quite modest prices and it is unlikely that any item could have been sold then for a six-figure sum. However, the dispersal of major collections including those of Colonel Harrie Evans (2001), Kevin Nelson (2002), "Zed" (2003), Greg Pope (2004) and Sir Gawaine Baillie (2005) - none of which included even one Type 1 or Type 2 essay - plus a number of significant properties offered overseas, saw a strengthening and maturing of the market for our rare stamps. The benchmark price was set in 2003 when the famed KGV 2d tete beche pair was sold at auction for the equivalent of almost $230,000. In last year's Baillie sale, two 3d Kangaroo part-imperforate strips sold for $115,000 (plus GST) and $149,500 respectively. Although these are all major pieces of great visual appeal and rarity, it is submitted that none of them is of anywhere near the importance and significance of the essays that introduced Australia's first stamp, the Penny Roo. We believe that these Kangaroo & Map essays are every bit as important to collectors of Australian stamps as is essay and proof material related to Britain's "Penny Black" and the United States' 1847 5c and 10c to their enthusiasts. We have formed the professional opinion that the estimates and associated reserves for the Kangaroo essays in this sale are realistic, responsible, and achievable. In fact, our expectation is that the next generation of collectors will look back and regard these figures as having been remarkably conservative. Our observation that the catalogue values are too low is borne out by the fact that the quotations for individual Type 3 essays were exceeded twice in the Nelson sale, a full two years before the catalogue was even published. This may be a "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity to acquire these seminal pieces. If you are seriously interested in this field, we encourage you to be bold. As the late and great Robson Lowe is credited with saying: "The quality (and ownership) will remain, long after the price has been forgotten". Sold AUD 150000 Prestige, 2006, Auction 121, Lot No. 6}

KE#5, 1912 1/- Map superimposed upon upon the Royal Standard and Australian Flag, Type 1 bi-colored paste-up essay in brownish red and blue, horizontal format on imperforate white wove paper, blue frame printed from letterpress blocks prepared by Rudolph Steel at the Block Arcade, Melbourne, with central Kangaroo vignette in brownish red being a cut-out and pasted in place within the map, wide margins, extremely fine and stunning.After rejecting the winning entries in the 1911 competition, Postmaster General Frazer commissioned Blamire Young of the Victorian Artist's Association late in that year to prepare alternative designs. It is recorded that Young delivered ten designs to the Postmaster General in January 1912, and recently discovered press announcements indicate that one of these designs showed a Kangaroo superimposed on a map of Australia. There are a total of nine recorded First Essays in seven different denominations based on this design, of which five were acquired (amazingly as one lot in the 1981 Williamson auction in London) by R.T.P. Chapman, whose collection was subsequently acquired intact by the Australia Post. This leaves only four in private hands and it is speculated that one of these may have been lost. Of the remaining three, the Gray collection presented here, has not one, but two of these immensely rare and important Kangaroo essays.Of the three essays in private hands of which we are aware, one is a mono-colored 2 1/2p value in bright blue with saw-tooth roulette 14 1/2. The other two offered here are the remarkable bi-colored paste-up essays in 1/- and 5/- denominations (see next lot). With one notable exception, these essays are never available at public auction. However, the April 2006 appearance at auction (Prestige Philately, lot #6) of the 2 1/2p mono-colored essay mentioned above created quite a sensation.

The rare chance to acquire one of these historically significant essays resulted in a record realization of A$172,500 (including the 15\% buyer's premium), clearly demonstrating not only the terribly conservative evaluation of A$75,000 assigned in the Australian Commonwealth Specialists' Catalogue, but also showing the strength of the market for Australian Kangaroo rarities. We fully expect that this essay, and the one that follows, will create their own sensation and will result in similarly eye-opening realizations - and deservedly so; ex-Abramovich.

Not only is each unique in their own right, but they feature the Australian Kangaroo design - whose stamps are among the most popularly collected and most recognized stamps in the world. An absolutely essential item for an award-winning exhibition collection. We cannot imagine a more perfect item to begin a collection of Australian "Roos"; ex-Abramovich (A$75,000 - our comments on the irrelevance of the current catalog value are detailed in the previous lot).
