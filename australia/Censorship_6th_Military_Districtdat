## Australia


###Sixth Military District

The Third Military District was the State of Victoria with Melbourne as the main District Civilian Censor Station. Melbourne was also where the "Deputy Chief Censor" was responsible for co-ordinating regular exchanges of information with the "Chief Censor Department" in London.

Blank re-sealing labels were used at the outbreak of the War with some of them carrying the hand written word "CENSORED" and intialialed by the censor. These were discontinued at the end of September 1939, when printed re-sealing labels became available.

The censor marks are typical of those used in the other Districts.
