## Sperati Forgeries

Jean de Sperati was probably the most dangerous forger of stamps in the twentieth century. He styled his forgeries as reproductions and he even copyrighted them in France. According to Robson Lowe <sup>1</sup> his first forgery was made in 1908 and his last in 1953.

There were two court cases against Jean de Sperati, the first brought by the French Customs authorities prosecuted Sperati for illegally exporting eighteen rare stamps to a stamp dealer in Lisbon in February 1942. There were eight hearings between April 1942 and April 1948 at the Court at Chambery. At the third hearing Sperati revealed that the stamps were his own creation. Dr. Edmont Locard, the famous French criminologist, stated they were genuine. It was not until Sperati produced four sets of these eighteen forgeries that he was believed. In 1948, the expert evidence of Leon Dubus, established that the stamps were forgeries.

The second case was brought by the Public Prosecutor in Paris in July 1946. This time the charge was one of fraud. Sperati was found guilty and convicted in April 1948 but appealed. In July 1952 the Appeal Court upheld the judgement. In 1955 The British Philatelic Association published a record of his work describing and illustrating 566 of his forgeries.

Many of his forgeries were made on genuine paper from which the image of a genuine stamp has been faded out.

Amazingly Sperati made a number of proof impressions and most of these are signed "Jean de Sperati".

On 16 March 1972,  Robson Lowe Ltd auctioned \textit{"The Work of Jean de Sperati"} containing some 257 lots with his forgeries. Many more have been brought to light since then and attributed to him. 

In the above sale Lot 2205 is of interest to Australian collectors as it had the &pound;2 stamp with the Kangaroo omitted. Apparently this was made by Sperati to prove that these forgeries were made by him.
