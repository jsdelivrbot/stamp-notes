\caption{14	1912 (Jun 12) use of specially inscribed airmail postcard at Darmstadt during experimental air mail flights on Rhein and Main, bearing 10pf for foreign postcard rate and mandatory 10pf etiquette for airmail surcharge, both tied by the special cancellation, addressed to Govt Geologist, Launceston. The pioneer Zeppelin airship Schwaben and airplane Gelber Hund serviced the flights, raising the possibility that this is the earliest Zeppelin-flown item to Australia, aside from being the only recorded example to Australia. [Remarkably, the subject matter is wholly commercial, referring in part to German Bank concessions in "Nyassa Land".] Estimate AU$5,000
