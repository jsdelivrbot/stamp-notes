###1st Military District

As you can see from the map, the First Military District was the State of Queensland. The civilian censor station was located in Brisbane. It is reported to have opened on the 3 Septemeber, 1939. Substations were opened on {{wi:Thursday_Island}}, at Townsville and Cairns.

Thursday island's sub-station operated only during 1940. By February 1941 its civilian mail was being routed to Brisbane for censorship. After the entry of Japan into the war, military censorship replaced the civilian censorship not only on Thursday island but also in northern Queensland.
