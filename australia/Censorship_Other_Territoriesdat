## Australia


###Other Territories
Censorship also took place in other territories under Australian control, such as the {{wi:Cocos_Islands}}, {{wi:Nauru}} and the {{wi:Norfolk_Island}}.

###The Cocos (Keeling) Islands
Until February 1942 these islands were under Singapore administration. When Singapore fell mail was transported secretely by Qantas Airways and until April 1945, civilian mail carried no special censorship markings. In April 1945, Australian military censorship started for the two squandrons of R.A.F., who arrived at that time.

In 1946 the administration of the islands reverted to Singapore.

###Nauru


###Norfolk Island
From the outbreak of World War II on 3 September 1939, civilian censorship was enforced on all mail leaving Norfolk Island. However, there are reports in the literature about examples that did escape censorship.{{footnote:1}}. Due to the very small amount of mail leaving the Island, especially during War conditions, all censor marks from Norfolk, can be considered scarce with the number 1 especially being very elusive.
