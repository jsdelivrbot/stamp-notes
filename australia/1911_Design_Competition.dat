\section{1911 Design Competition}

In the absence of any satisfactory designs for the uniform stamps, the Postmaster-General, Josiah Thomas, announced that a public design competition would be held to obtain suitable designs. 

The official announcement, together with the rules of the competition, was made in the "Commonwealth Gazette" on 21 January, 1911. The most important conditions were: 1) the designs should be submitted under a nom de plume; 2) the designs submitted should not exceed four times the size of the proposed stamp (1.125" x 0.675") - a stipulation that was frequently ignored, and be accompanied by a stamp-sized photographic reproduction; and 3) the designs should contain features characteristic of Australia, and include the words "Australia" and "Postage".

As of 31 May, 1911, the closing date of the competition, 1,051 designs had been received from 533 entrants. A first prize of £100 and two second prizes of £50 were awarded; two of the prize-winning entries have subsequently been lost. Designs not selected were to be returned to the entrants. A relatively small number of these competition entries are recorded in private collectors' hands today.

Donald Mackay

\ph[45%]{../australia/S-024.jpg}{1d. Coat-of-Arms, a pen and ink drawing highlighted with Chinese white on card (94x74mm.) along with the photographic stamp-size reproduction in sepia, touched up with India ink, on card (43x35mm.). BW E42, $30,000. 
Note: This design was awarded Equal Second Prize. The other two prize-winning entries - Altmann's ("Minerva") King George V portrait, and Arnold's ("Baldy") Kangaroo - were in the Ron Hyeronimus collection that was stolen in 1984. That collection is believed to have been destroyed, making the Mackay essay the only prize-winning entry available.
This essay is widely regarded as one of the most important and significant items of Australian philately in private hands.
