I find this 1914 stamp really interesting from the name of the bird the  {{wi:laughing kookaburra}} to the nice engraving
of the plate, which can be seen clearly if you scan the stamp at a good resolution.

Kookaburras are best known for their unmistakable call, which is uncannily like loud, echoing human laughter — good-natured, if rather hysterical, merriment in the case of the well-known Laughing Kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae); and maniacal cackling in the case of the slightly smaller Blue-winged Kookaburra (D. leachii). They are generally not closely associated with water, and can be found in habitats ranging from humid forest to arid savanna, but also in 
suburban and residential areas near running water and where food can be searched for easily.

Another Kookaburra stamp was issued in 1937.

 This example is a new find, with a similar portion of the plate number. 
 The ACSC (2006) catalogues the block at $500, however, that is 
 a typographical error and the price should indeed be $5000.

This time the Kookaburra looks stares left and a white block with the words _kookaburra__ was engraved.

All kookaburras are sexually dimorphic, but this is only obvious in 
the Blue-winged and the Rufous-bellied, where males have blue tails, females rufous.

<strong>The 3d. Kookaburra stamp was the first Australian stamp to be issued
for the benefit of collectors. It is also distinctive because it was
produced in a miniature sheet of four stamps, this being only the fourth
occasion such an item had been issued in the world. Richard Breckon
discusses the background to Australia’s first venture into this field</strong>

Kookaburras are carnivorous. They will eat lizards, snakes, insects, mice and raw meat. The most social birds will accept handouts from humans and will take raw or cooked meat (even if at high temperature) from on or near open-air barbecues left unattended. It is generally not advised to feed the birds too regularly as meat alone does not include calcium and other nutrients essential to the bird. Remainders of mince on the bird's beak can fester and cause problems for the bird.

They are territorial, and often live with the partly grown chicks of the previous season. They often sing as a chorus to mark their territory.

In the wild, kookaburras are known to eat babies of other birds and snakes, and insects and small reptiles. In zoos, they are usually fed food for birds of prey, and dead baby chicks.

<strong>The 1928 imperforate miniature sheet
was first listed in the 1970 edition of Stanley
Gibbons Part 1 catalogue, being priced
at £325. Today, the sheet is catalogued
at £60,000 (MS106ab). With only one example
being in private hands, the imperforate
sheet must rank highly as an Australian
Commonwealth philatelic rarity. If the day
comes when it is sold on the open market it
might very well achieve a record price for a single philatelic piece.</strong>
