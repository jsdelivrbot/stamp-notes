## Australia


###Fourth Military District

The Fourth Military District was the State of South Australia, with Adelaide as the District's Civilian Censor Station. As a smaller and less populous State it handled considerably less mail that the eastern seaboard States and this can be observed from the fact that 83 is the highest censor number that has been reported in the literature.

Sometimes mail routed from Queensland and the Northern Territory was also censored here.

At the beginning of the War a small round circular mark with a 'V' in the middle was the only mark found to denote that the letter was examined by a censor. 

Various resealing labels were used as well as handstamps. These are shown in the Table below.
