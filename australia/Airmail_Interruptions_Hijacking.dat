G-ASGR Dubai 21 November 1974

On the evening of 21 November 1974 captain Jim Futcher and his crew were at Dubai Airport awaiting the inbound flight from London to continue the BA870 schedule to the Far East. During the refuelling stop four men disguised as airport workers left the passenger lounge and ran towards the aircraft firing guns. A stewardess standing near the rear steps was hit but fortunately survived. On board they realised that the captain was not there and they demanded that he should get to the airplane or they would start shooting passengers.

Captain Futcher did not hesitate and made his way to the aircraft despite the airport's security officer urging him to stay out of sight. As he entered the aircraft he was met by a terrorist holding a gun to the head of a young New Zealander who greeted him with "Thanks for coming aboard Skipper". The aircraft took off with 27 passengers, 8 airport workers who had been cleaning the interior and 10 crew members.

As the authorities had closed off the airport at Beirut where the hijackers wanted to go to, the VC10 refuelled at Tripoli before landing at Tunis where it was surrounded by troops. The hijackers decided to stick to their demand for the release of 7 Palestinians held in Cairo and Holland. They set a deadline 24 hours away and promised to execute a passenger for every two hours past that time. When no progress was visible after 24 hours they murdered a German banker and dropped his body to the ground from the aft passenger door.

Negotiations resulted in the Cairo-held hostages being brought to the plane in exchange for 7 hostages. When the other two prisoners from Holland arrived the remaining hostages were also released, leaving captain Futcher, his co-pilot and flight engineer on board. Meanwhile the hijackers had been informed that their action had been condemned from all sides and their request for asylum in Tunis was also denied. Captain Futcher did his best to reason with them amidst their statements that they were willing to die for their cause. 

Captain Futcher was extensively recognised for his heroism in this case and awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal. He passed away in 2008 aged 86.

Time passed and deadlines went but the crew was still held inside with various explosives set around the cockpit. After an ordeal totalling 84 hours a gunman came to the cockpit but instead of the message the crew was dreading he informed them that they had decided to surrender.
