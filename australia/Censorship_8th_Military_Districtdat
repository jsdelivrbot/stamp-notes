## Australia: Civilian Censorship During World War II


###Eighth Military District

The eighth Military District was {{wi:Papua}}, which has been an Australian overseas territory since 1906. When war broke out on 3rd September 1939, a section of the {{wi:Port_Moresby}} General Post Office  was used to house the territory's main civilian censor station. There was also a sub-station at Samarai. The censor operations on Papua were on a small scale. Whitmarsh wrote{{footnote:1}}, that a Chief Censor and three assistants ran the main station and at least two assistants ran the sub-station.

{{bulb:On 12 February 1942, military replaced civilian government on Papua and mail became subject to military censorship.}}

###Samarai

{{wi:Samarai}} had a hand stamp very similar to the one used at Port Moresby, but it included a dotted line with the words "Asst. Censor". No resealing label has so far been identified as having originated from Samarai.
