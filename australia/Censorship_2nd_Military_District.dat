## Australia


###Second Military District

The Second Military District was the State of New South wales. The censor station was located in Sydney.
Another station was later opened in {{wi:Newcastle}}. Sydney's censor station examined the bulk of the mail entering or leaving Australia. During 1940, most of 1941 and late 1944 and 1945 a small percentage of overseas mail, mainly to U.S.A. was shipped without being examined by the censors.

The Newcastle metropolitan area being second most populated area in the state of New South Wales had a censor sub-station operating by 1940. Newcastle is a major port and here mail from Cessnock, Mark's Point, elmont, New Lambton and other communities serviced by Newcastle's Post Office were examined.

{{bulb:The first reclosing label used at Newcastle had nine dots. These labels were also used at the Sydney censor station between June and December, 1940. During this time some of Newcastle's mail was also examined by the Sydney Censor.}}
