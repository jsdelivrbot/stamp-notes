###Fifth Military District

The Fifth Military District was the Sate of Western Australia with Perth as the site of the District's Civilian Censor Station.

Despite regulations some uncensored mail was shipped to the U.S.A. in mid-1941 from Perth.

Handstamps were introduced of a rectangular shape and these remained into use well into 1943, when they were replaced with the standard diamond type. In the East the diamond type was introduced as early as 1940.  The Diamond type censor has been seen with numbers from 1 to 48.

The censor marks are typical of those used in the other Districts.
