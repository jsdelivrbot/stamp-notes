\chapter{1912 Kangaroo and Map Essays Part III}    

The Type 3 essay, had the map redrawn and Tasmania was added. The right value tablet was also removed, bringing the stamp design closer to the issued stamps. The essays are found on ungummed and unwatermarked paper. The essays were produced both perforated and unperforated.

It is significant that, unlike the Type 1 & Type 2 essays which were perforated by Steel, the Type 3 versions were definitely perforated by Cooke. The Type 3 essay was intended to be the final product and was widely circulated to the press for comment, which was almost universally scathing. Royalists objected to the absence of the King's portrait: others made derisory comments about the choice of the kangaroo, which was regarded by graziers as a pest that should be exterminated, or the tuft of grass that was dubbed a "rabbit". 

Compared to the Types 1 & 2 essays, Type 3 essays are relatively "common". They were produced in significant numbers for distribution to newspaper editors (believed imperforate only) and the ACSC records almost 40 singles (of which only 12 are noted as perforated) and seven sheetlets as being in private hands. Despite this seeming abundance, only a few examples have been offered at auction in the last decade.

While there are eight sheetlets of the high values recorded, the sheetlet offered here is the only uncut sheetlet of the low values that still exists today. Therefore, this remarkable essay sheet of Type 3 low value essays can be considered the rarest of all known Kangaroo essays. The only other unsevered multiples of the low values are two vertical pairs, one of which is in the Royal CollectionAn amazing rarity of significant importance and desirability, whose catalog value (A$100,000) while considerable will, in our opinion, ultimately prove to be conservative for this premier artifact of Australian philately.  Est. 75,000-100,000

The use of bi-colored printing for the high value essays suggests that an early decision had been made that these denominations would be bi-colored for the issued stamps. A number of color combinations were used, but there is no evidence that these sheetlets were used for selection of the issued colors. There are only eight intact high value essay sheetlets recorded, each in different color combinations, one being in the Australia Post archival collection.These rare high value essay sheetlets possess spectacular eye appeal and as such will certainly command considerable bidder interest; ex-Abramovich (A$75,000).

1912 Type 3 (Map Redrawn, Tasmania Added and Right-Hand Value Tablet Removed) Essay for the 1d in bistre-brown BW #KE28B Line Perf 12 1/2 on ungummed unwatermarked paper, excellent centring, very fine, undercatalogued at $20,000 (2004). The only perforated Type 3 1d essay in private hands and again, as a direct forerunner of the issued "Penny Roo", considered by us to be among the most important of all the Type 3 essays, along with the imperforate 1d in red. 

Kevin Nelson's collection included the perforated 2d in purple BW #KE29A and 10/- in violet & brown #KE32B, that sold for $20,160 and $25,760 respectively at our auction of 3/5/2002. Both went into major long-term collections. 

A good indication of how well-held Type 3 essays are is that neither Greg Pope nor Sir Gawaine Baillie (who was passionate about proof material) was ever able to acquire an example. Prestige 2016, Auction 121, Lot 8. AUS 50,000.

Norden"; it was Norden who acquired the estate of the stamp's engraver, Samuel Reading, in which the original of the master die proof was found, which is now in the Australia Post archival collection; also accompanied by photographic reproductions of the original master die, as well as large die proofs of the 10/- \pound1 and \pound2 values, which Norden used to publicize his purchase; and finally an original price list produced by Norden entitled "Proofs by Samuel Reading" in which he lists and prices various proofs found in the Reading estate (in addition to the fantastic Kangaroo large dies, there were various proofs of Papuan stamps and an Australian postal card), it is interesting to note that the Kangaroo master die was available for 300 guineas!
