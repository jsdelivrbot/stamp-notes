##The Half Penny Kangaroo Stamps

The \halfp stamp was probably issued on the 14 Jan 1913 in Melbourne as a cover from the Gray collection was dated "South Melbourne/15.1.13".  (See [The half penny kangaroo covers](../australia/The_half_penny_kangaroo_stamps_covers)).

The stamps can be found with a number of catalogued varieties. Some of them are obvious and easy to spot such as imperforates and others such as the watermarked varieties and plate imperfections are difficult to see. We illustrate some of the more
striking ones and for the rest offer a reference. The best reference of course is the bible of the Roos, the Brusden White Kangaroo Specialist Catalogue (BW).

### The AUSTBALIA variety

\ph[80%]{../australia/AG-110-error.jpg}{ }
\ph[50%]{../australia/AG-110.jpg}{#1o, \halfp   Green, "AUSTBALIA" variety, a rare used example showing a defective "R" in "AUSTRALIA" inscription at top, neatly cancelled, very fine; the most elusive and most popular of all the plate varieties found on this value, in fact, only two mint examples and a small handful of used examples are known (A$1,000).   \AG	 \soldd{750-1,000 }{1,100}. }  



\ph[90%]{../australia/S-050.jpg}{1/2d. green, a lower left corner strip of four with "CA" monogram, small light tone spot between second and third stamps, and the fourth stamp with light vertical crease, otherwise fine mint. S.G. 1; BW 1z, $500. \soldp*{150-180}

###Variety Imperforate at Bottom

\ph[90%]{../australia/S-049.jpg}{ 1/2d. green, a lower right corner block of twelve with "JBC" monogram, variety imperforate between stamps and margin at foot, fresh and fine mint. An impressive multiple of this rare error. BW 1b, $40,000. 
Note: The first strike of perforating comb was omitted on four Plate 2 (Lower) sheets. One left pane (with CA monogram) and three right panes (with JBC monogram) remain intact as blocks of twelve. One JBC block is in the Royal Collection, and another is in the Vickery collection at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney.

\ph[60%]{../australia/AG-95.jpg}{#1b, \halfp Green, imperforate at base, bottom right corner margin block of four, bottom two stamps being the error, typical irregular perforations, bright color, o.g., neatly folded along vertical row of perforations between right stamps and sheet selvage, diagonal crease in bottom sheet selvage well away from stamps, fine-very fine; an important error multiple; ex-Rasmussen, Cato and McNess (A$10,000+).   	\AG  Est. 5,000-7,500 

SOLD for $6,750.00 }


\ph[80%]{../australia/AG-96.jpg}{#1b/z, \halfd Green, imperforate at base, a highly important bottom left corner margin CA monogram block of six, the bottom three stamps being the error, as they are completely imperforate between the stamps and sheet selvage, o.g., couple of minor h.r.'s (in top stamps and in bottom sheet selvage, the three error stamps are n.h.), lightly folded along center row of horizontal perforations, fine-very fine; of the four CA monogram pieces of this error, only two remain in private hands, the block of six offered here from the Gray collection and a block of twelve which realized A$74,500 (including premium) in the July 2005 sale of the Sir Gawaine Baillie collection (A$20,000; clearly undercataloged as evidenced by the Baillie realization).   	\AG  Est. 20,000-30,000 

SOLD for $32,500.00 }


### Unlisted Variety Imperforate at Top

\ph[60%]{../australia/AG-97.jpg}{#1b var., \halfd Green, imperforate at top, used horizontal pair, apparently being imperforate between stamps and partial sheet selvage, neat 1914 machine cancel, fine-very fine; the only recorded example of this error; whether or not this imperforate error was the result of a true lack of perforations between the stamp and selvage, or is the result simply of jumped perforations, cannot be verified, nonetheless the size of the margin at top without any perforations would suggest this is a true error, and is unlisted thus in the ACSC.   \AG
