If your boss charged you half a pound tax and took that from your wage, he licked one bit to the filing he made to tax dept, and one bit in the tax book he was supposed to keep to SHOW he'd remitted your tax. 

Was widely used system for casual workers and tradesmen on building sites etc.

I think $200 was as high as they went.
