Based on a Peter North photograph of King in Admiral's uniform, this and the 1/4d (of same design) originally came from identical designs made for KE 8th.

This stamp was prepared with imprints in the KGV position and wide central gutter. Possibly due to the chalky paper used, the die was not rolled in as deeply as needed on the plate and gave rise to several prominent varieties. The so-called white wattles and dies are not normally defined very well in catalogues and do cause confusion. The three dies used are illustrated. Neither Die1a nor white wattles had anything to do with a die.
