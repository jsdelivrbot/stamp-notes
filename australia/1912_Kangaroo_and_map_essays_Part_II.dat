\chapter{1912 Kangaroo and Map Essays Part II}    
This vertical format design was determined to be less cluttered and better suited to stamp production, but the map of Australia was crudely drawn and the island state of Tasmania was omitted - leaving future modification inevitable. The Type 2 essay is even rarer than the Type 1, as there were five examples in different denominations recorded, although one (a 4p value) was in a private collection stolen in 1984 and it has never been recovered. Of the remaining four, one (a 6p value) is in the R.T.P. Chapman Collection, now part of the Australia Post archival collection. Thus, only three examples are left in private hands.In the same April 2006 auction (Prestige Philately) that the 2 1/2p First Essay appeared, a single Type 2 Second Essay was offered - an imperforate 1p value in carmine rose.

And just like the First Essay, the irrelevance of the catalog value assigned to the Second Essays (A$75,000 each) was demonstrated, as the 1p essay realized an impressive A$167,000 (including the 15% buyer's premium and 10% GST). We suspect that the appearance of this value will also re-write its current catalog value. This literally may be the last opportunity to acquire a Type 2 essay in our lifetimes; ex-Abramovich.

\caption{1912 Type 2 (Vertical Format with Two Value Tablets, and Tasmania Omitted) Essay for the 1d value in dull red imperforate on ungummed unwatermarked paper, very fine and attractive, under- catalogued at $75,000 (2004). Ex Derrick Ray. The Type 2 essay is even rarer than the Type 1. The ACSC records only five examples - all different values - of which one is in the Australia Post Archival Collection, and one is believed to be lost. This leaves a mere three examples in private hands, of which only this example is imperforate. The other two values are in major collections, at least one of which is believed unlikely ever to be sold. The vertical format was less cluttered and better suited to stamp production, but the map of Australia was very crudely drawn and Tasmania, the sixth State, was omitted. Further modification was thus inevitable. Being the 1d value, and in red - a direct forerunner to Australia's first stamp, the "Penny Roo" - this example is considered by us to be the most important of all the essays. It is not being melodramatic to suggest that this may be the only opportunity for the current generation of collectors to acquire an example of a Type 2 essay.
