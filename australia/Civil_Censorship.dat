###Civil Censorship

Civil censorship was introduced in Australia with the declaration of World War II. The Australian authorities were quick to recognize the thread posed by Japan, especially in Papua and the Northern Territory, which were both elevated to {{wi:Military_District}} status. Censorship 
stations and substations were created in Queensland, Papua, {{wi:Norfolk}} Island, Nauru and the Territory of New Guinea.

Following Japan's entry into World War II civilian censorship was replaced by military censorship in New Guinea, Papua and along the northern coast of Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland. Some parts of northern Queensland did revert back to civilian censorship following the allies advances in Papua, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. 

###Who were the censors?

Most of the censors were reported by J.C.Smith {{footnote:Smith}} as retired public servants and very often being former retired employees. The normal practice was similar to that of other British and Commonwealth countries, the censor would cut the envelope open and then reseal it, after reading the contents. He would reseal it using a resealing label. Sometimes the resealing label is at the back flap. In this cases it appears that the envelope was handed in unsealed. Sometimes if the mail was from a sensitive area the envelope was _sanitized_ by blacking out sensitive information such as the town datestamp, the return address and, in some extreme cases, even the postage stamps.

###Period 1939-1940

During 1939-40 a simple dot code, printed on teh label, indicated the origin of the censorship. At the same time code letters or dots were added to some of the censor handstamps. 


###1942

By mid-1942 when most other Commonwealth countries adopted the Imperial Censorship codes suggested by the {{wi:Chief_Censor}} in London, Australia following suit implemented a unified numerical code for all stations and sub-stations. The Table shows the various stations and codes.

Internal Mail was also subject to censorship if it fell into one of three categories:

- mail forwarded by sea from Darwin, Hobart and Launceston
- letters from areas with military installations, Prisoners of War or Internment Camps adn
- letters from persons on the suspect list.

###Intercepting Letters in transit

Letters in transi especially from French Oceania, such as New Hebrides and New Caledonia, where Vichy sympathizers made the mail suspect were also censored.
