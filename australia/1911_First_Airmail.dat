\chapter{First Air Mail}    
The introduction of the airplane in 1903 generated immediate interest in using them for mail transport. The first "quasi-official" airmail flight was conducted by Fred Wiseman, who carried three letters between Petaluma and Santa Rosa, California, on February 17, 1911.[5] The world's second airmail flight came the next day, when French pilot Henri Pequet carried 6,500 letters a distance of 13 km (8.1 mi) from Allahabad, to Naini, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, India, then part of the British Empire.[6] The letters bore an official frank "First Aerial Post, U.P. Exhibition, Allahabad. 1911"
