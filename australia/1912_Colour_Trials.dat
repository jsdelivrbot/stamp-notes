\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-59.jpg}{(a) 3PP(2)A, 1p Green, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in the issued color of the 1/2p on gummed unwatermarked wove paper, exceedingly well centered, brilliantly fresh color, just the faintest trace of a minute thin speck and just a small bit of album adhesion in one corner, still very fine and rare; only nine examples recorded, including a pair in the Royal Collection }
\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-60.jpg}{(b)3PP(2)B, 1p Red, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in the issued color on gummed unwatermarked paper, well centered, deep luxuriant color, few flaws including a small thin spot and some minor album adherence, of little consequence given that this is one of only five recorded, one of which is in the Royal Collection.}
\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-61.jpg}{(c)PP(2)C, 1p Deep blue, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in the issued color of the 2 1/2p on gummed unwatermarked paper, marvelously well centered, sumptuously rich color on bright paper, faint small hinge thin, of little importance, still very fine; the only example known in this color.}

\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-62.jpg}{(d) 3PP(2)D, 1p Olive, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in the issued color of the 3p on gummed unwatermarked paper, well centered, deep luxuriant color, thin spot at bottom, still very fine; an extraordinary proof rarity as this is the only example known in this color}
\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-63.jpg}{(e) 3PP(2)E, 1p Orange yellow, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in the issued color of the 4p on gummed unwatermarked paper, marvelously well centered, deep rich color, couple of trivial faint thin specks and minor album adherence, still very fine; an extraordinary proof rarity as this is the only example known in this color. }
\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-64.jpg}{(f) 3PP(2)F, 1p Chestnut, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in the issued color of the 5p on gummed unwatermarked paper, wonderfully well centered, rich color, very faint thin, still very fine; an extraordinary proof rarity as this is the only example known in this color.}

\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-65.jpg}{(g)3PP(2)H, 1p Violet, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in the issued color of the 9p on gummed unwatermarked paper, well centered, strong color, small inconsequential thin spot, still very fine; an extraordinary proof rarity as this is the only example known in this color.}
\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-66.jpg}{(h) 3PP(2)I, 1p Emerald green, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in the issued color of the 1/- on gummed unwatermarked paper, well centered, rich color, faint inconsequential thin spot, still very fine; an extraordinary proof rarity as this is the only example known in this color.}
\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-67.jpg}{(i) 3PP(2)J, 1p Brown, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in the issued color of the 2/- on gummed unwatermarked paper, quite well centered, deep rich color, couple of tiny thin specks and a faint horizontal bend, still very fine; an extraordinary proof rarity as this is the only example known in this color }
\clear
\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-68.jpg}{(j) #3PP(2)K, 1p Brown and blue, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in the issued color of the \pound1 on gummed unwatermarked paper, rather well centered, fresh colors, couple of faint thin specks of little relevance given this proof's unique status, still fine; of special note is that the kangaroo vignette has a "short" tail and a damaged foot; this dual color combination in the color of the \pound1 certainly holds a special distinction among these unique color trials, being that it is a bi-colored print and not a paste-up, and is the only bi-colored color trial; an extraordinary proof rarity as this is the only example known in these colors }
\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-69.jpg}{(h) 3PP(2)L, 1p magenta pink, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in an unadopted color on gummed unwatermarked paper, nicely centered, bright color, minor thin spot, still very fine; this color was possibly intended for the 2/6p denomination, originally intended for inclusion in the series, but the \pound2 was substituted by mistake instead; an extraordinary proof rarity as this is the only example known in this color }

\caption{the unique complete set of eleven different 1p color trials submitted to the Postmaster General for approval of colors, certainly among the most important and valuable trial color proofs in philately; the lots will first be offered individually, then offered as a single lot for one increment above the total of the individual realizations.

Est. 4,000-5,000 
sold for $4,750.00}


\phl*[30%]{../australia/AG-72.jpg}{72	TC	3PP(2)A	#3PP(2)A, 1p Green, perforated 12 1/2 plate proof in the issued color on unwatermarked white wove paper, light horizontal bend, light soiling (trial cancel or extraneous ink from printer's fingers?) on left portion, fine; accompanying enlarged photograph of the pair of the 1p Green trial color proof from the Royal Collection suggests that the copy offered here was originally adjacent to the right hand side of the Royal pair, as the same soiling pattern and imperforate margin at top are consistent, in addition the previous trial color offered in the above lot may have, more than likely, come from the left hand side of the Royal pair, further suggesting that these were printed in strips of four; one of only nine examples recorded, of which two are contained in the pair housed in the Royal Collection (A$6,000).  Est. 3,000-4,000

\ph[80%]{../australia/AG-73.jpg}{73	Official final approval of the 1p Color Trial, a most remarkable historical artifact; following considerable criticism of the proposed Kangaroo designs, the Prime Minister, Andrew Fisher, called upon Postmaster General Frazer to furnish, in early September 1912, proofs of the printed stamps for his final consideration, it is believed examples of the final design, in approved base letter rate color, printed from the first 1p plate manufactured, were supplied to this request; offered here is the original envelope supplied to Andrew Fisher, which was thought to contain four examples of the 1p color trial, the envelope having been endorsed by by Fisher "Important/New Stamps/Andrew Fisher/4-9-12", envelope with handsome "Commonwealth of Australia/Prime Minister" imprint in red on reverse; this envelope and the proof which follows in the next lot together make for a matchless exhibition page.
