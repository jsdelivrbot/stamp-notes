\section{French Morocco}

French Morocco (Fr. Maroc) was a colony of France established by the Treaty of Fez in what is now the country of Morocco minus the north which was a Spanish protectorate.

It existed from 1912 when a protectorate was formally established, until Moroccan independence on 2 March 1956, and consisted generally of the area of Morocco between Fez and Rabat, south to Mogador. 

French activity in Morocco began during the 19th century and in 1904 France and Spain secretly partitioned the country of the sultanate, with Spain later creating Spanish Morocco from its portion. 

A French postal agency had sent mail from Tangier (Fr: Tanger) as early as 1854, but the formal beginning of the system was in 1891, when French post offices were established throughout the sultanate. The offices issued stamps of France surcharged with values in pesetas and centimos. In 1911, the Sherifian post was created to handle local mail (note the TANGER CHERIFVEN postmark).

The Dallay catalogue

Dallay is a French philatelic editor established in Paris. Dallay has published stamp catalogs since 2001.

The catalogs list postage stamps issued by France and other francophone areas: metropolitan France, French overseas territories, French post in Andorra and Monaco. In late 2005, Dallay published a catalog for the French former colonial empire.
The catalogs provide detailed information about the stamps, such as, stamp designers' names, postal use at the time of issue, etc.

In 2004, Dallay was convicted by a court of justice of forgery and unfair competition for the use of Yvert numbering system which was first used in 1895. In March 2005, after arbitration by the French Conseil de la Concurrence (Competition Commission), Yvert et Tellier began to license the right to print an index of Yvert stamp numbers at the back of competitors' catalogs. Dallay began using the index starting with the 2005-2006 edition.
