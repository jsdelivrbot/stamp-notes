\chapter{1898-1900 Local Overprint}   

The first adhesive stamps for Gibraltar, overprinted on the contemporary issue for
Bermuda, appeared on January 1, 1886, and from that date until the Gibraltar issue
of November 1889 was overprinted 'Morocco Agencies', all the current stamps
of Gibraltar were used in the various post offices of Morocco regularly. They are not, however,
at all common, especially the issue of January 1886.
