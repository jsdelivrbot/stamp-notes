\chapter{1955-57 QEII Definitives}

These were to be the last definitives to be used in Morocco, as soon after their issue
Tangier was re-incorporated into the now independent Morocco. The postage stamps
were recess printed by Waterlow and Sons. Perf. 11 by 12, watermark St Edward's Crown.

(a) Overprinted 'Tangier', 2/6, 5/-, 10/-.

(b) Further overprinted '1857-1957', 2/6, 5/-, 10/-. These three stamps may be
found with no hyphen between the two dates. This occurs only in the first printing
and it is possible that the hyphen dropped out during printing. It occurred once in the sheet on
number 34. A second printing shows the hyphen re-inserted on number 34, but in this
printing the bar to 5 in 1957 is slightly shorter than normal. There is yet a third printing of
the 2/6 in which the hyphen is present but the 5 of 1957 has now a long bar.

All three high values show a small 7 in 1957. This is more distinct that is the abr to the 5.
