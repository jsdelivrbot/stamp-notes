\chapter{1925-32 Issue} 

Though in strict chronology the 2/6 to 10/- values should be considered next, it is
perhaps more convenient to deal with the low values with block watermark first.
1925-31. Typographed by Waterlow \& Sons (except 6d.) and later 1934-35 by harrison and Sons (all values).
Until 1934 the 6d. was printed at Somerset House, Watermark Multiple Royal Cypher in block letters. Perf 15 x 14.
The Table below combines the issue for spanish and french currencies for convenience (catalogues tend to
split the listings into two).

(ii) Overprinted Morocco Agencies and surcharged in centimes and or franks as before;
(iii) Overprinted Morocco agencies only 14mm long;
