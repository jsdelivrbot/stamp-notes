\chapter{Gibraltar Issues Overprinted: 1903-06}  

\section{Watermark Crown C.A. }
Between 1903-05 stamps of Gibraltar were overprinted in black sans-serif capitals on Watermarked Crown C.A. (single). perf. 14. Seven values were overprinted, 5c., 10c., 20c., 25c., 50c., 1p., 2p. The first to appear
was the 25 centimos purple and black on blue which was issued on July 1, 1903.

\begin{tabular}{lll}
 5 centimos  &grey-green and green     & January 1904\\
 10 centimos &dull purple on red       & August 1903\\
 20 centimos &grey-green and carmine   & September 1904\\
 25 centimos &purple and blak on blue  & July 1, 1903\\
 50 centimos &purple and violet        & July 3, 1905\\
 1 peseta    &black and carmine        & November 19, 1905\\
 2 peseta    &black and blue           & November 19, 1905\\
\end{tabular}

\section{Varieties}

(a) As  before the printing was in two panes of sixty stamps and the overprint was from
the same setting as the London overprint on the Victorian issue. As a result the varieties
broad top to M and hyphen between n and c of Agenecies are found again for all values, as also
is the variety broken e in Agencies. All printings are Plate 1 but there was a later printing of
the 25 centimos in which, while the variety broad-topped M continued, the variety hyphen between n 
and c of Agencies was corrected. It is possible that this printing occurred when the Multiple Crown
stamps were overpinted in June 1906 and that a few sheets of paper with single watermrk were included
in the printing. The 'corrected hyphen' variety is rarer.

(b) The 5 centimos exists with a very faint barely visible, grey overprint.

(c) No. 6 in the top row of the right-hand pane has flattened bottom to final o
of 'Morocco' for all values.


\section{Specimen}

The set of all seven values exists, the word 'Specimen' being in black sans-serif capitals
14.5mm long and 2.5mm high. The varieties 'broad M' and 'broken e' have been found on Specimen
copies but are very rare.

There is doubt as to whether the 50 centimos as to the status of the 50 centimos postage stamp, with
some philatelists considering this stamp to be 'prepared for use but not issued'.
