\chapter{Introduction}

\lettrine{T}{he British post offices} in Morocco, also known as the "Morocco Agencies", were a system of post offices operated by Gibraltar and later the United Kingdom in Morocco.

The pre-adhesive period lasted from April 1, 1857, when the first British post office was opened in
Tangier, until probably 1872 when a Post Office cancelling stamp was issued to the British Postal
Agency in Tangier.

Apparently for the whole of this period and the next, the rates were twopence to Gibraltar
and sixpence from Gibraltar to England. It would seem that all mail went via Gibraltar.

In the ports of Morocco postal business was transacted in much the same manner by the British
Vice-Consul. rabat commenced a courier service on July 21, 1858, whil an office was established
in Mogador in 1864.

The first French post office had been opened in Tangier possibly as early as September 1849
and certainly by 1854 while the first Spanish office followed on the Spanish-Moroccan War
of 1863.

During this period stamps were not provided in the British Agencies. They had to be obtained from
Gibraltar by the sender---or were put on there.

The first office was established in Tangier in 1857; mail was simply bagged there and forwarded to Gibraltar just across the water, where it received the standard "A26" postmark. From 1872 Tangier had its own postmark, but this was applied alongside the stamps (allowing for the Gibraltar cancellation to mark them), so usages of British stamps from Morocco are best determined on cover. Several examples of loose GB Queen victoria stamps cancelled Tangier do exist including at least one strip of 1d reds.

Since the offices were under the control of Gibraltar, they switched to the use of Gibraltar stamps when they came into use, 1 January 1886. Additional offices opened in various Moroccan seaports during the 1880s, and inland at Fez (1892), and {{wi:Meknes}} (1907).

The stamps were overprinted "Morocco / Agencies" beginning in 1898, initially at the offices of the Gibraltar Chronicle, and then later in London, yielding several variations in the appearance of the overprint.
