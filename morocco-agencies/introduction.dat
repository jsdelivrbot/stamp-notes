\chapter{Introduction}

The pre-adhesive period lasted from April 1, 1857, when the first British post office was opened in
Tangier, until probably 1872 when a Post Office cancelling stamp was issued to the British Postal
Agency in Tangier.

Apparently for the whole of this period and the next, the rates were twopence to Gibraltar
and sixpence from Gibraltar to England. It would seem that all mail went via Gibraltar.

In the ports of Morocco postal business was transacted in much the same manner by the British
Vice-Consul. rabat commenced a courier service on July 21, 1858, whil an office was established
in Mogador in 1864.

The first French post office had been opened in Tangier possibly as early as September 1849
and certainly by 1854 while the first Spanish office followed on the Spanish-Moroccan War
of 1863.

During this period stamps were not provided in the British gencies. They had to be obtained from
Gibraltar by the sender---or were put on there.
