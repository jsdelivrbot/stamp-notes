Lot: 851		Sale: 47 Morocco Agencies: Postal Stationery: 1898 Gibraltar overprinted 10c. + 10c. reply card. On 19th. May 1898, records show 10,500 10c. cards and reply cards were overprinted, however only 625 (instead of 736) specimen 10c. reply cards were available to be sent to the U.P.U. at Berne. In September 1899, the Secretary of the G.P.O. London requested the missing 111 reply cards. Authority to print 125 was sought from the Colonial Secretary, who refused permission on the grounds that no 10c. reply cards had been sent to Morocco. This item therefore has to be a ''Specimen''.
