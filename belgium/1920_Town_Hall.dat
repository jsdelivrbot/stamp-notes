\section{The Stamps and Postal History of Belgium}
The 65 cent stamp, depicting the townhall of Dendermonde (French : Termonde) was issued on 5 August 1920. It was a completion of a definitive series of stamps printed between 1915 and 1919 which depicted on the lower nominations - 1 cent up to 25 cent - King Albert I and the higher nominations - 35 cent up to 10 Francs - various subjects.
Originally, the stamp was to have a denomination of 20 cents. By the time the commission was given, the postage rates had changed and there was a need for a stamp of 65 cents for express rate post. A run of 10 million stamps was ordered. The stamp was designed, engraved and printed by the Dutch company Joh. Enschedé in Haarlem, the Netherlands and exists in two versions: a first run was printed in sheets of 25 (5 by 5), a second run was printed in sheets of 100 (10 by 10). This was because of a shortage of paper. The two runs can be identified by the dimensions of the image. The first run has an image of 26,25 by 22,5 mm, whereas the second run's dimensions are 27 by 22 mm. Perforation measurement is 11½. End of use date was 1 May 1931.
[edit]Inversion




Two sheet of the first run had its centre inverted, so that the depicted town hall is upside down. Most likely the cause of this error was similar to the one of the Inverted Jenny, since the Belgian stamp has also two colours. The first sheet was partially sold in the Post Office of Ghent. After this discovery was made, the management of the Belgian Post went to Enschedé to find out if there were more. A second sheet was discovered, transported to Brussels and destroyed.
One pane of the second run was also inverted. 50 copies of these were discovered in January 1921 in Leuven. They were confiscated by the Post Office before they could be sold to the general public. The remaining 50 were still in Holland and were cut, this being witnessed by Dutch and Belgian officials. The 50 already in Belgium were destroyed by burning them on 21 January 1921.
[edit]Known stamps




18 of the 25 stamps were sold at the Post Office of Gent (Fr. Gand) on 13 August 1920. When the discovery was made, only 7 copies remained.
At the moment there are 17 known copies: 15 unused and 2 used. The only known cancellation is "Gand 13/8/1920". In 1942 a stampdealer from Brussels, who had two copies of the stamp, was murdered. The murderer and the two stamps were never found.
[edit]Value




The cancelled stamp is valued at € 75,000 and is one of the most expensive Belgian stamps.
[edit]Popular culture




In 2003 the stamp was the subject of the comic book Het mysterie van de omgekeerde zegel (The mystery of the inverted stamp) in the serie Stam en Pilou.
In 2004, the stamp was the subject of a children's book De omgekeerde Dendermonde (The inverted Dendermonde) by author Henri Van Daele.

\ph[35%]{../belgium/1030.jpg}{1030		139a	#139a, 1920 65c Town Hall at Termonde, Center Inverted, a wonderfully fresh and choice example of this great rarity, strong rich colors and impressions on bright paper, well centered, full o.g., small h.r., very fine.As with many famed inverted centers, the story as to how the errors came about and were placed into circulation is an integral part of fascination with them. This famous rarity of Belgium - the only inverted center stamp of the country - is no exception. We quote from "Linn's Philatelic Gems 2" which wonderfully details the story. "The stamps went on sale August 5 (1920) as planned. Eight days later, a clerk at the Ghent Central Post Office began breaking up a sheet in the normal manner to sell individual stamps to customers. Nine stamps from this sheet were sold to a hotel bellhop. Several other customers purchased the 65c stamps and affixed them to letters. Then Hye de Crom purchased one of the Termonde stamps. He noticed something unusual about it. The Town Hall was upside down. The clerk had been selling stamps from a sheet with inverted centers without realizing it. Knowing the potential value of these major errors, de Crom returned to the window to buy more stamps from the sheet. He succeeded in purchasing 16 inverts in all - the last three rows of the sheet and a copy from the first row. The other copies of this remarkable error probably were used on mail and later destroyed.Adding further to the story of the particular example offered here, Willy Balasse, a famous collector/dealer in Brussels, purchased this exact invert in the fabulous Josiah K. Lilly sale conducted by Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries in 1967. He subsequently sold it to Robert Cunliffe who has kept it in his collection for four decades. An exciting opportunity to acquire one of the great rarities of the world and one of the keys to an important collection of Inverted Centers - with only 16 copies thought to exist. Lightly signed in pencil on the reverse by Willy Balasse (Michel #124F; \euro90,000).   	 $67,500.00
