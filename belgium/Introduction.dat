\section{The Stamps and Postal History of Belgium}

On 24 December 1847, the Belgian Senate passed what was known as the Postal
Reform Bill, which provided for the manufacture and issue of postage stamps, to be
used to frank letters from one post-office to another. This Bill, after various amendments,
finally became a law on 22 April 1849. 

This law fixed the tariff for ordinary
letters at ten centimes for thirty kilometres or under, and at twenty centimes for
distances over thirty kilometres within the kindgom. An \textit{ordinary letter} was one
that did not weigh more than ten grammes, letters weighing more than ten grammes
and less than twenty grammes paid \textit{double rate}, and those weighing over twenty
grammes were charged twenty centimes additional for each forty grammes, or fraction
thereof, in excess.



Spink Shreves Galleries Sale - 114. The Robert H. Cunliffe Collection of Spectacular Inverted Stamps of the United States and the World - June 18-19, 2009

\ph[35%]{belgium/1030.jpg}{1030		139a	#139a, 1920 65c Town Hall at Termonde, Center Inverted, a wonderfully fresh and choice example of this great rarity, strong rich colors and impressions on bright paper, well centered, full o.g., small h.r., very fine.As with many famed inverted centers, the story as to how the errors came about and were placed into circulation is an integral part of fascination with them. This famous rarity of Belgium - the only inverted center stamp of the country - is no exception. We quote from "Linn's Philatelic Gems 2" which wonderfully details the story. "The stamps went on sale August 5 (1920) as planned. Eight days later, a clerk at the Ghent Central Post Office began breaking up a sheet in the normal manner to sell individual stamps to customers. Nine stamps from this sheet were sold to a hotel bellhop. Several other customers purchased the 65c stamps and affixed them to letters. Then Hye de Crom purchased one of the Termonde stamps. He noticed something unusual about it. The Town Hall was upside down. The clerk had been selling stamps from a sheet with inverted centers without realizing it. Knowing the potential value of these major errors, de Crom returned to the window to buy more stamps from the sheet. He succeeded in purchasing 16 inverts in all - the last three rows of the sheet and a copy from the first row. The other copies of this remarkable error probably were used on mail and later destroyed.Adding further to the story of the particular example offered here, Willy Balasse, a famous collector/dealer in Brussels, purchased this exact invert in the fabulous Josiah K. Lilly sale conducted by Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries in 1967. He subsequently sold it to Robert Cunliffe who has kept it in his collection for four decades. An exciting opportunity to acquire one of the great rarities of the world and one of the keys to an important collection of Inverted Centers - with only 16 copies thought to exist. Lightly signed in pencil on the reverse by Willy Balasse (Michel #124F; \euro90,000). (Image)	 $67,500.00
