In May 1903 De La Rue produced the first of St. Helena's stamps showing views of the Colony. The \halfd., 2d. and 1/- vignettes show "Government House". The 1d., 8d. and 2/- vignettes show the "The Wharf" at Jamestown.

The stamps were printed by typography and show how unsatisfactory was typography for reproducing a landscape. They also suffer from fussy ornamentation and unbalanced lettering.

fine MVLH, Cat £100. AUS100}

The date of issue on the Island is not known for certain, but as the 1d. value was noted on covers of 30th May and 31st May 1903, they were evidently issued before June.
