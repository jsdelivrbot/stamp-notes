\ph[60%]{../saint-helena/760_0072.jpg}{72				THE EARLY ST. HELENA MAILS, 1636-1812
VERY EARLY LETTER FROM INDIA TO G.B. BY "YE SHIPP LONDON" WHICH STOPPED AT ST. HELENA EN ROUTE; Very fine and attractive EL from "Gulcondah" [Hyderabad, India] addressed "To my Loving Uncle Mr. William Hurt marc[hen]t these be d[elivere]d In Bishopsgate streete, London" and endorsed "per a friend whom god preserve" below the address. The sender, "Thomas Rogers", notes that "I am in duty bound to make use of ever[y] conveighance, and now in Mesulapatnam Road ye shipp London proffers herselfe my letter be[a]rer and gives me occation to acquaint you that by the shipp Discovery I sent divers letters to yourself and others...", also acknowledging the receipt of the addressee's last letter ("of the 15 March 1634" which was "14 m[onth]s" in transit) "by "ye Shipp Crispine", noting that he was "soe far from Mesulapatam" that he could not chasse up some missing goods there. The ship London that carried this letter is recorded [British Library index of East India voyages; copy included] as having sailed from Masulipatam in July 1636, calling at Petapoli (Aug. 1636), Bantam (Oct 1636 to Jan. 1637), Cape Town (27 March 1637) and St. Helena (21 April 1637) before reaching England (the Downs) on 18 July 1637. This is therefore a doubly important early letter; it is one of only a handful of letters recorded from India before 1650, and one of the earliest known letters carried via St. Helena.

75				THE EARLY ST. HELENA MAILS, 1636-1812
THE EARLIEST RECORDED LETTER FROM ST. HELENA - ADDRESSED TO G.B. FROM THE ISLAND's SURGEON; 6 Feb. 1681/2 EL (cleverly folded to show the date-line beside the address-panel; minor internal dusting) from "St. Hellenah", addressed; "These for Mr. Thomas Lewes at his office in ye East India House in Leadenhall Street, [these be] d[elivere]d I pray, In London" and endorsed "pr shipp London Q.D.G."; without postal marks because it was presumably carried by an East India Co. ship on the Company's business and therefore not subject to postage being delivered direct to their Leadenhall St. H.Q. [The island had finally returned to East India Co. control in December 1673.] The long letter is written & signed by "Fra[ncis] Moore", the East India Co.'s St. Helena Surgeon (who was sent to the island in 1672 and stayed until at least the 1680s), who is complaining bitterly about the lack of good medicine on the island and the arrogance of the Governor, as well as mentioning the Island of Ascension; "Our Iland is very sickly and so are the soldiers, and ye medicines are bad at ye first but are now expended....[I] wishe myselfe upon [the Island of] Ascention where ye fowyles [seabirds!] would be more kind then ye people here...if I were Chyrurgion of a ship I should live better...." This is the earliest recorded letter from St. Helena. Important Page One for any St. Helena Collection and in remarkably fine condition. [Noted in Hibbert's book, p.142.
