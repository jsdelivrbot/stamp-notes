\chapter{Napoleonic Era}
Napoleon was imprisoned and then exiled to the island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean, 1,870 km from the west coast of Africa. In his first two months there, he lived in a pavilion on the Briars estate, which belonged to a William Balcombe. Napoleon became friendly with his family, especially his younger daughter Lucia Elizabeth who later wrote Recollections of the Emperor Napoleon.[132] This friendship ended in 1818 when British authorities became suspicious that Balcombe had acted as an intermediary between Napoleon and Paris and dismissed him from the island.[133]

Napoleon moved to Longwood House in December 1815; it had fallen into disrepair, and the location was damp, windswept and unhealthy. The Times published articles insinuating the British government was trying to hasten his death, and he often complained of the living conditions in letters to the governor and his custodian, {{wi:Hudson_Lowe}}.[134]

With a small cadre of followers, Napoleon dictated his memoirs and criticised his captors---particularly Lowe. Lowe's treatment of Napoleon is regarded as poor by historians such as Frank McLynn.[135] Lowe exacerbated a difficult situation through measures including a reduction in Napoleon's expenditure, a rule that no gifts could be delivered to him if they mentioned his imperial status, and a document his supporters had to sign that guaranteed they would stay with the prisoner indefinitely.[135]

Longwood House, Saint Helena: site of Napoleon's captivity
In 1818, The Times reported a false rumour of Napoleon's escape and said the news had been greeted by spontaneous illuminations in London.[note 6] There was sympathy for him in the British Parliament: Lord Holland gave a speech which demanded the prisoner be treated with no unnecessary harshness.[137] Napoleon kept himself informed of the events through The Times and hoped for release in the event that Holland became prime minister. He also enjoyed the support of Lord Cochrane, who was involved in Chile's and Brazil's struggle for independence and wanted to rescue Napoleon and help him set up a new empire in South America, a scheme frustrated by Napoleon's death in 1821.[138]

There were other plots to rescue Napoleon from captivity including one from Texas, where exiled soldiers from the Grande Armée wanted a resurrection of the Napoleonic Empire in America. There was even a plan to rescue him with a primitive submarine.[139] For Lord Byron, Napoleon was the epitome of the Romantic hero, the persecuted, lonely and flawed genius. The news that Napoleon had taken up gardening at Longwood also appealed to more domestic British sensibilities.[140]

UNIQUE (?) "Napoleon" SIGNED LETTER SENT WHILE A PRISONER ON ST. HELENA TO THE ISLAND'S GOVERNOR; 18 Jan. 1816 letter (on blue china glaze paper with embossed border; overall toning - without wrapper) sent locally within the island from "Longwood" (Napoleon's home on St. Helena from 1815 to 1821) and boldly signed "Napoleon" in full (very rare thus). Addressed at the foot (in French; presumably in Count Bertrand's hand); "A L'Amiral Sir George Cockburn" (the island's Governor and directly responsible for Napoleon's security at this date). Napoleon asks Cockburn to put at the disposal of "Count Bertrand" the 4,000 Napoleons in cash [around £4,450 at the time!] that were still on board H.M.S. Bellerophon (the British naval ship that had brought Napoleon to the island in October 1815) "to settle payments that are owing to various members of my household and to provide for other needs.". Letters written by the Emperor from the period of his exile on St. Helena are of the utmost rarity, largely because of the subsequent Governor, Sir Hudson Lowe, who insisted on opening and censoring Napoleon's correspondence; so Napoleon then signed hardly any letters of his own at all and the only examples of his handwriting on St. Helena that have appeared on the market are fragments from his memoirs, or other notes which were for his own private use. It is remarkable, therefore, that this letter should have survived and particularly having his full signature which is itself extremely rare with only six examples so far recorded (Napoleon initially having signed his name as "Bonaparte" and then preferring to sign his documents with either an `N' or `Napol'). Sir George Cockburn, who had served with Nelson at Trafalgar accompanied Napoleon on the Bellerophon from Plymouth to his final exile on St. Helena, becoming Governor of the Island until the arrival of Hudson Lowe. Count Bertrand was at this time Napoleon's closest Associate and referred to as his Grand Marechal . Given the early date of this letter and its content, which clearly refers to disembarkation at St. Helena; this is thought to be the earliest letter of Napoleon dating from his time of exile ever to be offered on the market and it is certainly one of only a handful still surviving from this period. This remarkable letter was collected by Henry Ponsonby [1825-95; equerry to Prince Albert from 1856 to 1861 and then private secretary to Queen Victoria from 1870 until 1895]. Accompanied by the part page from an early 19th century scrap-book (Ponsonby's presumably) from which the Napoleon letter has been carefully removed and which has a brief manuscript poem about Napoleon. This is a highly important St. Helena and Napoleonic item of great rarity and huge historical significance. [Provenance; Dominic Winter book auction, 29 Sept. 1999, lot 364.]	\pound10000.}

His personal physician, Barry O'Meara, warned the authorities of his declining state of health mainly caused, according to him, by the harsh treatment of the captive in the hands of his "gaoler", Lowe, which led Napoleon to confine himself for months in his damp and wretched habitation of Longwood. O'Meara kept a clandestine correspondence with a clerk at the Admiralty in London, knowing his letters were read by higher authorities: he hoped, in such way, to raise alarm in the government, but to no avail.[141]
In February 1821, Napoleon's health began to fail rapidly, and on 3 May two British physicians, who had recently arrived, attended on him but could only recommend palliatives.[142] He died two days later, after confession, Extreme Unction and Viaticum in the presence of Father Ange Vignali.[142] 

His last words were, "France, armée, tête d'armée, Joséphine." ("France, army, head of the army, Joséphine.")[142]
Napoleon's original death mask was created around 6 May, though it is not clear which doctor created it.[143][note 7] In his will, he had asked to be buried on the banks of the Seine, but the British governor said he should be buried on St. Helena, in the Valley of the Willows. Hudson Lowe insisted the inscription should read "Napoleon Bonaparte"; Montholon and Bertrand wanted the Imperial title "Napoleon" as royalty were signed by their first names only. As a result the tomb was left nameless.[142]

In 1840, Louis Philippe I obtained permission from the British to return Napoleon's remains to France. The remains were transported aboard the frigate Belle-Poule, which had been painted black for the occasion, and on 29 November she arrived in Cherbourg. The remains were transferred to the steamship Normandie, which transported them to Le Havre, up the Seine to Rouen and on to Paris.[145]
On 15 December, a state funeral was held. The hearse proceeded from the Arc de Triomphe down the Champs-Élysées, across the Place de la Concorde to the Esplanade des Invalides and then to the cupola in St Jérôme's Chapel, where it stayed until the tomb designed by Louis Visconti was completed. In 1861, Napoleon's remains were entombed in a porphyry sarcophagus in the crypt under the dome at Les Invalides.[145]

Taken from Buonaparte's room by Frank Daniell, 2nd Mate of the Kent, 1824"; recent research into Napoleon's death (from stomach cancer/ulcers) has suggested that he may have suffered from arsenic poisoning - a plausible theory is that this occurred by accident due to arsenic being present in the green colouring of wallpaper at the time!

Napoleon's physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found the cause of death to be stomach cancer. Antommarchi did not, however, sign the official report.[146] Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, though this was seemingly unknown at the time of the autopsy.[147] Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer, and it was the most convenient explanation for the British who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of the emperor.[142]



In 1955, the diaries of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, appeared in print. His description of Napoleon in the months before his death led Sten Forshufvud to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate arsenic poisoning, in a 1961 paper in Nature.[148] Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with Ben Weider, noted the emperor's body was found to be remarkably well-preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking high levels of orgeat syrup that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.[148]
They maintained that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expulsion of these compounds and that the thirst was a symptom of the poison. Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left behind extensive tissue damage.[148] A 2007 article stated the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral type, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion his death was murder.[149]
The wallpaper used in Longwood contained a high level of arsenic compound used for dye by British manufacturers. The adhesive, which in the cooler British environment was innocuous, may have grown mould in the more humid climate and emitted the poisonous gas arsine. This theory has been ruled out, as it does not explain the arsenic absorption patterns found in other analyses.[148]
There have been modern studies which have supported the original autopsy finding.[149] Researchers, in a 2008 study, analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, and from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 times higher than the current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives.[note 8] Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death.[151]

ON COVER EX BRITISH CAPTAIN IN CHARGE OF NAPOLEON; Remarkable 11/15 Mar. 1817 EL (minor dusting of address side) from "Island of St. Helena" to the writer's sister in Herefordshire charged "3/6" (single Packet rate) and then "4/4" (with the extra 10d inland rate) having a mainly very fine rare black London crowned oval "INDIA/PACKET LETTER" d.s. (Rob.In.P2 - only known 1817-18 - 23 May; month inverted) nicely placed on the front. The long cross-written letter is from Captain Thomas Poppleton of the 53rd Regiment who was specifically put in charge of Napoleon, with many mentions of the V.I.P. Prisoner; "...With regard to my rencontre with his Majesty, it is erroneously stated [in the British press]; we never exchanged a syllable in consequence of his riding at a very great rate; when out of my sight I lost him altogether but I did not trouble myself about him & left him to join a Party I was engaged to dine with to return when he pleased. I related what had happened to Admiral Sir. G. Cockburn who was of the party, & he desired me - if we ride out again - not to lose sight of him & to ride near him. In the course of a day or two, he [Napoleon] sent for me to say he wished to ride. I sent word that I should attend him with pleasure, but that for the future I should ride near him if I chose - not as his servant in that I should behave to him with every delicacy possible, that I would not interrupt or listen to his conversation & if a wish was expressed by him to be left alone it should be complied with. The horses were unsaddled, his breakfast equipage unloaded & he gave out [that] he was unwell. We have never ridden together since...Napoleon...expressed himself highly pleased with myself - I have no doubt but that all I desired to be told him was misconstrued...All the China ships are here & all longing to see my charge, but he will not see any of them. He is under very severe restrictions & will not quit his residence. If he chooses to go with me, he can go where he pleases, but the Emperor of the French cannot stoop to ride with a British Captain. He is not at all angry with me. He sent for me some time since & told me to tell the officers of the 53rd Regiment that he was obliged to them for their delicacy towards him, that they were brave men, good soldiers & that he esteemed them much..." He adds detail about the island itself and lists some of the extortionate prices charged for food items and for lodgings. A highly interesting and historical insight into Napoleon's daily life as a prisoner.	£750.

HELENA/PACKET LETTER" (16 Aug.; long after the letter was written!) - only 12 examples recorded - on the front partly overstruck by the boxed "Ω" Scottish Mail Tax mark of London (27 Oct. arrival backstamp). The letter includes fascinating references to Napoleon; "...I am settled at Deadwood close by Napoleon. I have had the honour of being introduced to him. He asked me 'how long I had been in the Army. Did I like my profession. Did I prefer killing to fighting', etc., etc. There is certainly very little of the great man in his manners or appearance, except in the commanding tone in which he addresses all his questions to you, and the stern look he has when your answer is not prompt. Being so near Longwood, I shall probably see more of him." He also mentions recent news of war in India and the fact that he is in charge of the health of a regiment of 1,230 men including many who were sick. Rare eye-witness account of this famous prisoner.
