# The Barquitos stamps of Buenos Aires 

The postage stamps of Buenos Aires are listed erroneously in the stamp
catalogues as provincial issues, like Corrientes, which they are not.
Corrientes was one province in the Argentine Confederation, which used
its own stamps in its local postal system and the confederation stamps in the
completely separate national postal system.

On the other hand, Buenos Aires was an independent country in 1858, not
part of Argentina.\footnote{During most of the 19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject. It was already capital of Buenos Aires Province, and between 1853 and 1860 it was the capital of the seceded State of Buenos Aires. The issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally settled in 1880 when the city was federalized and became the seat of government, with its Mayor appointed by the President. The Casa Rosada became the seat of the President.} If there had been a United Nations in 1858, Buenos Aires
would have been a separate member which issued its own stamps. The early
stamp catalogues recognized this distinction and listed the stamps under Buenos
Aires in the B’s, not under Argentina. After winning the persistent civil war,
Buenos Aires joined the provinces of the Argentine Confederation in the
Republic of Argentina and issued the Escuditos stamps.

The \textit{Barquitos} stamps of Buenos Aires, named after the image of a steamship
(“Little Ship”), are one of the rarest regularly-issued series in classic imperforate
philately, immediately after the “Post Office” Mauritius, Hawaiian Missionaries and
British Guiana Cotton Reels. In fact, in the first Scott postage stamp catalogue, the
Barquitos have the highest listed prices.

Multiples and covers of the Barquitos are so rare that it is barely possible to form
one major collection of Buenos Aires. Single stamps are the overwhelming majority
of the existing Barquitos. These stamps were collected primarily by the great
general classic imperforate collectors, particularly Alfred H. Caspary and Alfred F.
Lichtenstein. When these collections were sold at auction in the 1958 Caspary and
1970 Dale-Lichtenstein sales, the Barquitos were acquired by Joseph Schatzkes, who
was forming the major collection of Argentina at the time, and by John R. Boker Jr.,
who recognized the extreme philatelic importance of the Barquitos. When Stanley
Gibbons broke up the Schatzkes collection, Boker added the primary items to his
collection, which was sold at auction in 1979 by the German firm of Mohrmann.
The most important material passed either directly or indirectly in the Islander
collection, where it has resided until it was auctioned by Siegel in 2008.

Many of the images presented in these articles are based on this collection and are published with the permission of Siegel.
