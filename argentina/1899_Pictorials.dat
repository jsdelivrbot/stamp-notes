\subsection{1899 Pictorials}

\phl[30%]{../argentina/1003.jpg}{1003		139a	#139a, 1899 1P Blue and black, Center Inverted, deep rich colors, actually better centered than most existing copies as the majority are found quite poorly centered, typical slightly brownish o.g., lightly hinged, very fine; only 50 were printed and several of these were used; light expert's handstamp.   	 $1,500.00 
SOLD for $1,050.00} 
\phl[30%]{../argentina/1004.jpg}{004		140a	#140a, 1899 5p Orange and black, Center Inverted, handsome mint example of this rare error, deeply rich colors, attractively centered, o.g., relatively lightly hinged, very fine; light expert's handstamp; while one sheet of 50 was printed, several stamps are contained within blocks of four or larger (including one block of ten from the Peter Balner collection which we sold in September 2002), making singles of this error offered with far less frequency than other values from the series.   	 $2,750.00 
SOLD for $1,600.00 }
\phl[30%]{../argentina/1005.jpg}{1005		141a	#141a, 1899 10p Green and black, Center Inverted, a wonderfully fresh mint example of this key error stamp, which unlike the 1p and 5p values from the same set with inverted centers, is almost never seen offered at auction, strong rich colors, well centered, o.g., minor h.r., trivial gum bend, very fine; the first example of this we have offered.   	 $3,600.00 

SOLD for $4,000.00  }

\ph[30%]{../argentina/1006.jpg}{1006		142a	#142a, 1899 20p Red and black, Center Inverted, a seldom seen example of this error, with perforated large letters "Inutilizado" (essentially "canceling" the stamp from use) as always found, deep rich colors, o.g., minor h.r., fine.   	 $2,000.00 

SOLD for $1,600.00 }
