\subsection{Seal of the Republic}

In 1862, with the National Postal Service unified and nationalized, Gervasio Posadas is appointed Administrator of the Post Offices of the Republic of Argentina.

The "escuditos" (little shields) go into circulation,they are the first stamps that bear the legend "Republic of Argentina" and are lithographied in the Mint of Buenos Aires.
The "escuditos" of 1862 was the first issue of Argentina unified (previously had used the Buenos Aires and Argentina Confederation separately). From these stamps were three different runs, which are easily distinguishable. 's first run in January 1862 was performed on the three values (red 5c, 10c, 15c green and blue). The feature that distinguishes it from the next is the word "Republic" has the accent on the U.
