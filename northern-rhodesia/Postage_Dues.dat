\section{The Mkushi Provisional Postage Due Stamps}

In July 1953, postal rates within the South African Postal Union were increased. Many post offices in Northern Rhodesia experienced shortages of Postage Due stamps. Owing to a misunderstanding, quantities of 1d. definitive stamps and of the 1953 Rhodes Birth Centenary stamps were overprinted and surcharged. Although unofficially prepared, their usage was subsequently approved by the Postal Authorities.
