Northern Rhodesia was created in 1911 from territory administered by the [British South Africa Company](../BCA/Introduction), becoming an official British protectorate in 1924, and achieving independence as Zambia in 1964.

With effect from 12 September 1923, the 33rd anniversary of the arrival of Cecil Rhodes' Pioneer Column on the site of Salisbury (now Harare), the settler population having rejected in a referendum the option of joining the Union of South Africa, that part of Rhodesia lying between the Limpopo and Zambezi Rivers was formally annexed to the British Crown as a self-governing colony.

Letters patent granting responsible government to Southern Rhodesia were issued on 1 October. Six months later, on 1 April 1924, responsibility for the administration of the territory north of the Zambezi was transferred from the British South Africa Co (BSAC) to the Colonial Office, and Northern Rhodesia became a British Protectorate. Both Southern and Northern Rhodesia continued in the first instance to use Rhodesian (BSAC) stamps and postal stationery. Southern Rhodesia issued its own stamps on 1 April 1924, but it was not until 1 April 1925, that Northern Rhodesia followed suit. The Admiral stamps of Rhodesia, first issued in 1913, remained valid for postal use in Southern Rhodesia until 30 April 1924, and in Northern Rhodesia until 30 September 1925. Rhodesian (BSAC) revenue stamps presumably continued to be valid for use for the same periods.


In the 1890s, mail from North-Western Rhodesia was carried by runner to Bulawayo, while North-Eastern Rhodesia mail went via British Central Africa until 1895.[1]

Before and after its creation, Northern Rhodesia used the stamps of Rhodesia. The change to protectorate included a change of stamps, and on 1 April 1925, Northern Rhodesia issued its first stamps. Inscribed "NORTHERN RHODESIA", the seventeen values all depicted a wilderness scene with elephants and a giraffe, surmounted by a profile of King George V. The same design was adapted for King George VI in 1938.

Northern Rhodesia's first commemorative stamps were a set of five on 30 May 1953, marking the birth centennial of Cecil Rhodes, along with another stamp issued on the same day for the Rhodes Centenary Exhibition. As Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom was already on the throne, the stamps included her profile, even though the official coronation stamp did not come out until 2 June. This was followed in September by a definitive series using the same design as before, with the monarch's profile updated once again.

Northern Rhodesia joined the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953, and used the Federation's stamps until it was dissolved in 1963. On 10 December 1963, a new definitive series depicted the Queen and the territory's arms, but these were withdrawn on 23 October 1964 when Zambia became independent.

The first stamps of independent [Zambia](../Zambia/Introduction) were issued on 24 October 1964. They consisted of a set of three commemoratives. On the same day, a set of 14 definitives was issued, with depictions of various professions and scenes.

\section{The Design of Northern Rhodesia's First Stamps}

The story behind the design of Northern Rhodesia's first stamps, which was unique to the colony
and was used for three successive definitive issues featuring three different monarchs, begins
with a letter from the Crown Agents dated 11 July 1924, addressed to Thomas de la Rue & Co
(The only surviving documents relating to this issue are in De La Rue's correspondence books,
now lodged with Royal Mail Heritage Services, at Mount Pleasant, London).

\begin{letter}
I have to inform you that a new issue of postage stamps for Northern Rhodesia has been
authorised to be supplied in the design of the Nyasaland type, incorporating the words
"Northern Rhodesia". I have therefore to request that you will proceed at once with the
preparation as far as possible of the necessary new border duty plates, and we will advise
you at a later date of the denominations which will be required. A sketch of the border
duty plate with the wording should be submitted to us for approval. You should note that
these stamps are most urgently required and they should be delivered to our inspector not
later than the end of September.
\end{letter}

Thus the original proposal was to use De La Rue's key-plate design, which was then being used
for the stamps being printed by De La Rue for Nyasaland and a number of other colonies. Three
days after receiving this letter De La Rue responded as follows:
We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th inst. with reference to a new issue
of Postage Stamps for Northern Rhodesia in the design of the Nyasaland type. As requested,
we have pleasure to submit for your approval sketches in both postage and receipt size of
the wording necessary for the border duty plates. The Postage and Revenue dies have been
used for the sketches, and we should be glad to know if these are to be followed, or Postage
only. Respecting the denominations required, we shall be obliged if you would kindly
state when ordering the sizes to be used for each. We have noted the urgency of the
requisition, and will proceed with the engraving immediately upon receipt of your approval.

The sketches submitted by De La Rue were, a) a print
of the master die for the border-duty plates for the smallformat
Nyasaland stamps with the value (3d) and the
words 'NORTHERN RHODESIA' painted in Chinese
white into the value tablets and the tablet below the
space for the King's portrait respectively, and b) a print
of the border-duty die for the 10s, as an example of the
large-format design, with the words 'NORTHERN
RHODESIA' painted in Chinese white in the bottom
tablet. Both essays were mounted on cards dated
"14.7.24", and both cards were annotated "Appd /
(initials) / 14/7/24" in manuscript. The present
whereabouts of these essays is not known, and the only
illustrations available are a poor photocopy replacing
the page in De La Rue's correspondence book on which
they were mounted, and an illustration in a Robson Lowe

The Crown Agents, having approved these essays the day they were submitted, ie 14 July
1924, returned them the same day together with the following letter:

\begin{letter}
Referring to your letter of to-day's date, we return herewith duly approved the sketches for
the wording of both postage and receipt size stamps for Northern Rhodesia. The wording
"postage and revenue" as in the present dies is to be followed. The denominations of the
new issue and the suggested colours are as follows:

\end{letter}

1/2 d Green 6d

1d Brown 8d

I 1/2d Red lOd

2d Orange l/-

3d Dark Blue II-

4d Mauve

2/6 Black with Green Head
5/- Grey with Mauve Head
7/6 Violet with Black Head
10/- Green with Black Head
207- Red with Purple Head

De La Rue duly acknowledged receipt of these instructions on 16 July:
We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th inst. returning, approved, the
sketches for the new issue of Postage and Receipt Stamps. As arranged verbally, the
engraving of the values '/id to I/- only will be proceeded with pending further instructions.
The suggested colours have been noted, and a colour scheme will be submitted for your
approval as quickly as possible.
The proposed issue of stamps was, however, to prove less straightforward than either party had
thought. The Crown Agents must have received revised instructions from the Colony, as on 26
July they telephoned De La Rue instructing them to suspend further work on the issue. This
advice was confirmed in a letter dated three days later:

In confirmation of our telephone conversation of the 26th July I have to request that you
will arrange to suspend further work in connection with the preparation of the border duty
plates of the Nyasaland type for the Northern Rhodesia stamps. We understand that the
expense so far involved amounts to about £45.0.0. Kindly confirm.
De La Rue replied on 7 August confirming that they had suspended work on the dies and plates,
and stating that "The expense involved so far amounts to £34". On 12 August De La Rue were
informed that the "instructions to
prepare the Nyasaland type of
border-duty plates\ldots should be
cancelled and the cost of £34, being
the expense involved, should be
invoiced to us as usual". The
invoice "for work on the Northern
Rhodesia dies and plates" was duly
forwarded on 21 August.

A letter dated 31 July from
the Crown Agents to De La Rue,
which must also have been sent to
Waterlow & Sons (see below),
explains the reason for the
instruction to abandon work on the
key-plate design:

The Government of Northern
Rhodesia has in contemplation
an issue of postage and revenue
stamps, and has asked us to
obtain designs and prices. You
are therefore invited to submit
three finished and coloured
designs, and prices for the
supply of stamps based on the
material given in the enclosed
tender.
The three designs, one
of each of the three sizes of
stamps specified should show
the VvA duty in green, the l/-
duty in black and orange and
the £2 in black and blue. The
largest size of stamps are to be
marked "Revenue" only. It is
intended that these stamps be

(illustrated courtesy of Royal Mail Heritage Services)
produced by the copper plate or "intaglio" process, and quotations should clearly show (1)
the cost of printing the stamps, including the cost of paper (2) the cost of dies and plates,
and (3) the cost, if any, of renewal of plates. It is estimated that the annual requirements of
postage stamps will be about 2,100,000 and until such time as further details of the quantities
of each value are known the quotation should be based on this figure. The designs and
quotations should be in our hands not later than noon on Tuesday 26th August.
The "material given in the enclosed tender" referred to in the first paragraph of this letter appears
to have consisted of at least two documents. The first read as follows:
The general design of the stamps is to be based on the rough sketch which may be seen on
application at the office of the Crown Agents for the Colonies with the following
modifications:

1. The numeral indicating the denomination to be removed from above the crown and
the crown with the oval bearing the head of His Majesty the King to be taken to the
top edge of the stamp.

2. The ribbons containing the words "Northern Rhodesia" to be removed and

3. the denomination shown in the top left and top right corners in place of the curled
terminals.

4. The word "Threepence" removed from the ribbon at the bottom of the oval bearing
the King's Head, and the words "Northern Rhodesia" inserted therein, or alternatively

5. The words "Northern Rhodesia" to be [sic] appear at the extreme foot of the design.
The stamps are to be produced by the copper plate or intaglio process, the pence values in
ordinary postage size, the shillings values in a larger size as specified above. The whole
issue is to be printed on CA watermarked white paper. The quantities of postage stamps
required for one year over the range of denominations Vkl to 207- is about 2,100,000
details of quantities for each duty will be notified later. A proof of the colours selected is to
be submitted to the Crown Agents for approval before printing is commenced. The
production is to be under the control of the Crown Agents' Chief Inspector of Stamps, to
whom supplies are to be delivered.

The second document listed estimates of the numbers of stamps required in the first year.

\end{figure*}

De La Rue's tender was submitted as a typed form (Fig. 2) listing, a) the duties, b) the colours of
the dual-purpose postage and revenue stamps, which were as originally specified by De La Rue
for the Nyasaland-type key-plate design, c) the sizes of the stamps - 21 x 25 mm, 24 x 30 mm and
28 x 33 mm, and d) the proposed plate formats, 120-, 80- and 60-set respectively. The column in
which the quantities of stamps was to be entered was left blank, and against the large-format
revenue stamps under the column headed "Colour" was typed "To be stated / later". The prices,
which were as quoted immediately above were entered in manuscript, together with the cost of the
dies and plates - £480 - a total of £758 18s 9d. A second set of figures headed "Waterlow" is
written in manuscript above De La Rue's figures. Waterlow's rival bid was 2s 4d per 1,000
(compared with 2s OVid) for the small-format stamps, 11s 7'/2d per 1,000 (compared with 16s
5%d) for the large-format postage and revenue stamps and £4 19s (compared with £5) for the
revenue stamps, a total stated to be £283 6s 2d though it is actually £281 11s (compared with
£278 18s 9d). The amount tendered by Waterlow for the dies and plates is, however, not recorded.
The essays submitted by De La Rue with their bid are described below and illustrated as Figures
6 to 8.

The end of the story as far as De La Rue were concerned arrived with the post on 9 September 1924, in the form of a letter from the Crown Agents informing them that their "tender
for the supply of postage and revenue stamps for Northern Rhodesia has not been accepted".

The reason may have been that the total amount bid by Waterlow was lower, but it is also evident that the essays submitted by De La Rue did not conform to the specifications set by the Crown Agents in the tender documents.

Fairweather's Essay
The origin of what was described by the Crown Agents as a "rough sketch" of the proposed
design was recorded by the man responsible, W.G. Fairweather, in an article originally published
in The Northern Rhodesia Journal in 1951, and reproduced in the Journal of the Rhodesian
Study Circle in 1974 and again in 1988 (Ref. 1). Fairweather became Commissioner for Lands,
Mines and Surveys in Northern Rhodesia in 1930, and had probably trained, and been initially
employed by the Northern Rhodesia Government, as a surveyor.
Towards the end of 1924, the Governor, in Executive Council, and when Mr. H.A. Baldock
MBE, was Postmaster-General, decided that the Territory should have its own issue of
postage and revenue stamps. Mr. Baldock came to my office one day and said that it was
proposed to make an issue of stamps for the Territory and would I design a stamp for him
for submission to the Governor and Executive Council. . . I told him I had never done
anything of that sort before, but if nobody else was available, I would see what I could do.
I was given no instructions nor advice nor any sort of guide as to what was required
conventionally or officially or artistically - in fact I was given a free hand.
I chose the threepenny stamp for two reasons: (1) its colour was blue and (2) the
liquid draughtsman's ink which I was accustomed to use in preparing plans, and which I
knew ran easily, did not clog and looked 'nice' was Higgin's Blue.
I prepared a frame four times the size of the existing threepenny stamp. After
deciding, to my idea, the general layout, e.g. King's Head oval, Territory's name space,
postage and revenue space, and value spaces, I then set to and prepared the picture part of
the design. This part of the whole design was never altered from the first to the last of the
designs I prepared for the Government to examine and approve.
The picture part merely represents to my mind the typical outstanding flora and
fauna of the Territory - the native 'Mashukulumbwe' on their element in a dugout on the
Kafue River, and a view of the hills I remembered off the Zambezi River in Northern
Rhodesia and below the confluence of the Kafue River. The elephants and the giraffe are
both inhabitants of Northern Rhodesia. . .1 prepared, I think, five designs in all. . .
Fairweather refers to the "final" version being examined by the Governor, which would suggest
that only that version was submitted to the Crown Agents. It is evident from the essays subsequently
submitted by De La Rue and Waterlow that they worked from Fairweather's design, making the
modifications specified in the Crown Agent's tender documents, but his essay does not appear to
have survived.
Fairweather's memory was faulty in one respect, though that is hardly surprising as he
was writing 27 years after the event and was not himself a philatelist. The 3d stamp in use in
Northern Rhodesia in 1924 was the 'Admiral' design, printed for Rhodesia by Waterlow as a
bicoloured stamp with the portrait in black and the frame in yellow. The only blue stamp then
current was the monochrome 2*/2d duty of the same design.

De La Rue's Essays Based on Fairweather's Design What are probably the earliest of a series of photographic essays produced by De La Rue are illustrated as Figures 3 and 4.

They have been described in a recent article published in The Journal of the Rhodesian
Study Circle, where they
were incorrectly attributed
to Waterlow (Ref. 2). Both
are in the form of stampsize
photographs in sepia
on white paper. In the essay
illustrated as Figure 3 the
portrait of the King has
been cut to shape from a
die print in black, and stuck
onto the photograph, and
the outer border has been
enhanced with lines drawn,
rather crudely, in Indian
ink partly infilled with
Chinese white. Indian ink
was also used to strengthen
some lines in the design
close to the vertical

sepia with the borders drawn in Indian ink and Chinese white, and

Fig. 4. (Right) An essay based on a photographic print in sepia
of the essay illustrated as Fig. 1 with the borders drawn in

borders. The second essay (Fig. 4) is a photograph of
this mock-up, with the borders enhanced in the same
way. Illustrated as Figure 5 is a photograph in black of
a design measuring 8.5 x 10.85 cm, which appears to be
a further improved version of De La Rue's essay with
neatly drawn borders.

inscribed 'NORTHERN RHODESIA' in a ribbon
under a left-facing portrait of the King that is
noticeably larger than in the first sketch. The
annotation reads: "second rough / with head /
size of original". The outlines left of the sketch
appear to be alternatives for the frame around
the portrait.

The pencil sketch of the same type illustrated as Figure 11, a proposed design for the
revenue stamps, shows features in common with Fairweather's original essay in that giraffes,
elephants, canoes, etc are represented. The figure of value in the tablet at top-left is '£2', but the
figure at top-right is '£50'. An alternative for the value tablet at top-left is shown to the right of
the essay, and an alternative for that part of the design below the word 'REVENUE' and above
'NORTHERN RHODESIA' is shown below. This is annotated "canoes out", and indeed they
have been left out. The words "Black / Centre & Blue £2" written above the essay are significant,
as these are the colours specified for the revenue stamp essay in the Crown Agents tender notice
(see above).


It is worth noting that these preliminary pencil sketches are for the small format postage
and revenue stamps and the revenue stamps. The Crown Agents tender notice required the submission of a third essay for the large format postage and revenue stamps (1 s to 20s), and there
is therefore a distinct possibility that a preliminary design for stamps in this format exists, though
it has never, as far as the author is aware, been reported.

The Royal Collection includes the beautiful hand-painted essays illustrated as Figures 12
to 14, which are described by Sir John Wilson as follows (Ref. 3):

\begin{blockquote}
Artist's drawings by Waterlow, all hand-painted. The ViA for the small design and the 1 s
for the larger design in issued colours on glazed cards. There is also a drawing for the
fiscal stamps in larger size with inscription 'REVENUE'. £2 black and blue.
\end{blockquote}

\section{Waterlow's Dies and Plates}

Die proofs for this issue originally in Waterlow's archives, and subsequently acquired by De La Rue when they absorbed Waterlow, are described by Colin Eraser and Robson Lowe as follows (Ref. 4):

The series was prepared in three sizes, though each is similar in design. The low value
stamps intended primarily for postal use were issued in mono-colour in a small format.
The higher value stamps from I/- to £1, inscribed 'Postage and Revenue', were engraved
in large format and were printed in two colours. The high value stamps from £2 upwards
were printed in mono-colour in an even larger format and were inscribed 'REVENUE'.
The three master dies prepared were:-
10466 low values 'Postage [and Revenue]' 10.9.24
10467 high values I/- to £1 'Postage and Revenue' 10.9.24
10468 high value £2 upwards 'Revenue' 10.9.24
A die proof of the die for the low denomination type was included in the record books. The
proof was additionally endorsed 'proof no. 2337' and 'CANCELLED'. The portrait of
King George V, used for the low values was also used [in 1933] for Basutoland and a proof
of this portrait in the record book is numbered 10466a/9268. The portrait for the high
values was 10467a and was used also for Cayman Islands. It is endorsed 'Proof No. 3604'.
The die for each denomination derived from the three master dies was numbered in the
index book though it is not possible to allocate particular die numbers to each denomination.
Postage types
Revenue type
10502-10504
10505-10509
10517-10519
10532-10536
10510-105162
21.10.24
23.10.24
24.10.24
1.11.24
1.10.24
Numbers 10515 and 10516 are marked 'NOT USED'

The only die proof included in the record books is for a 1/2d. value with the words
'Postage and Revenue' cut away. This proof is numbered 10508a with roller die number
7399. It is endorsed 'CANCELLED'. The die for the 3/- denomination of this series was
prepared in 1929. The die is numbered 12270 and in the index volume is dated 16.4.29.
Eraser and Lowe illustrate three
items, all of which are printed
in black: a) a proof from the
master die for the small-format
postage and revenue stamps (die
no. 10466; proof no. 2337); b)
a proof from the die used for the
portrait in the large-format
postage and revenue stamps (die
no. 10467a; proof no. 3604);
and c) a die proof of the
halfpenny duty with the words
'POSTAGE & REVENUE'
excised (die no. 10508a; proof
no. 7399). The first of these
items is illustrated here as Figure
15A, and the last item as Figure
15B. On the latter the word
"CANCELLED" is written in
purple-black ink. This variation
of the design, ie without the words 'POSTAGE & REVENUE', was used for both the KG VI and
QEII issues of Northern Rhodesia (see below), and it is possible that this was an 'essay' to assess
the effect of this change.

Surprisingly some of the dies and the plates made from them still exist. The issue of TheThe Africana Museum, Johannesburg (now Museum Africa), some little time ago received
on indefinite loan certain plates and dies of Northern Rhodesian stamps, with the authority
of the PMG of that territory. All are well defaced; they are a rather heterogeneous lot and,
one might say, curiously incomplete. Here is a list of them:
1. KING GEORGE V. REVENUE STAMPS:-
£5, Frame duty die, numbered 10510 £2, Frame duty die, numbered 10511
£30, Frame duty die, numbered 10513 £50, Frame duty die, numbered 10514
Value blank, Frame duty die, numbered 10466* A smaller size than the others.
A blank duty, numbered 10468
2. POSTAGE AND REVENUE STAMPS, KING GEORGE ISSUE 1925:-
2d Single Working Die, numbered 10502 3d Single Working Die, numbered
10505
4d Single Working Die, numbered 10517 5/- Frame duty die, numbered 10533
These two sets of dies are all negatives.
3. CYLINDERS, EACH WITH TWO IMPRESSIONS. POSITIVE. 7MASTER DIES:-
£2 Revenue Stamp, numbered 4081, 10511
Postage and Revenue Stamps: I'/id, numbered 4071, 10506
Id, numbered 7394, 10507 I/-, numbered 4084, 10515
5/-, numbered 4087, 10533 10/-, numbered 4090, 10535

4. COPPER PLATES :-

2d 12 horizontal by 10 vertical, no. 35417 2/6 10 horizontal by 8 vertical, no. 35442
107- 10 horizontal by 8 vertical, no. 35451 20/- 10 horiz. by 8 vertical, no. 35452

5. STEEL PLATE OF THE 3D. CORONATION STAMPS 

South African Philatelist dated September 1945 (Ref. 5) contained the following report:
An error in this listing is identified with an asterisk; the die numbered 10466 is the master die for
the small-format postage and revenue stamps. The die numbered 10468 is the master die for the
border-duty plates of the revenue stamps (see below). As far as the 'cylinders', ie transfer roller
dies, are concerned, it is relevant that Williams in Fundamentals of Philately states: "It has been
and still is widespread practice to take up more than one relief on the transfer roll" (Ref. 6). This
would provide a back-up in the event that a relief was damaged during the making of the plate.
The bad news is that the Museum's acquisition records show that these transfer dies "have been
missing since 1945". The sheet formats of the postage and revenue stamps were correctly reported,
possibly for the first time, as 12 x 10 for the small format type and 10x8 for the larger format
stamps. They had previously been assumed to be 10 x 12 and 10x6 (Ref. 7). The original tender
documents had specified that the plates were to be produced by the "copper plate or intaglio
process", and indeed they are made of unfaced copper, though Waterlows usually printed from
steel plates, eg the plates for the double-head and Admiral series of Rhodesia.
The dies and plates have been recently re-examined (Ref. 8). Perhaps the most important
point is than none of the plates for the postage and revenue stamps bear either an imprint identifying
the printer or a plate number. However, the few known surviving issued stamps with the whole or
part of the central portion of the bottom sheet-margin attached show that an imprint - 'Waterlow
& Sons Limited, London Wall, London E.G.' - is present below the two stamps in the centre of
the bottom row of sheets of both the small and large format postage and revenue stamps. The
imprint must therefore have been printed as a separate operation. It is in the colour of the stamps,
or in the case of the bicoloured, large format postage and revenue stamps, the colour in which the
border-duty plate was printed. In 1972 it was reported in the Newsletter of the Lusaka Philatelic
Society that the Zambia National Archives collection included complete sheets (10 x 6) of the £2,
£5, £10 and £30 duties (Ref. 9). These sheets also bear an imprint in the centre of the bottom margin, but in this case it is not known whether or not the imprint was printed from one of the pair
of plates used to print the stamps as no plates appear to have survived. No plate numbers have
been recorded for any of the stamps. The Royal Collection includes the postage and revenue set
to 20s in bottom right-hand blocks of four; there are no plate numbers (Ref. 10).
The guide marks on the four plates for postage and revenue stamps in Museum Africa are
of particular interest and significance (see below). On the plate for the 2d duty the guide marks
would have printed as a vertical line between the two central stamps in the bottom row (but not
the top row), and horizontal lines between the two central stamps in the left and right marginal
columns. There would also have been a 'T'-shaped mark, rather than a cross, between the stamps
in the centre of the sheet with the vertical line between positions 66 and 67. On the plate for the 2s
6d duty the guide marks are in the form of lines between the central reliefs in the top and bottom
rows, and the right and left columns, and a cross between the four reliefs in the centre of the plate.
The guide marks on the plates for the 10s and 20s duties are different. They are all between rows
2 and 3, and would have printed as two prominent dots centrally between the stamps at positions
22, 23, 32 and 33 and 28, 29, 38 and 39 in a sheet. A horizontal line starting 0.5 mm to the right
of the first dot extends for a further 7.5 mm to the right between the stamps at positions 23 and
33. A similar line extends 7.5 mm to the left from 0.5 mm left of the second dot between the
stamps from positions 28 and 38.
The marginal markings would have printed in the centre of all four sheet margins as coloured
dots 15 mm from the nearest stamps with an attached 12 mm 'dash' pointing outwards. These
markings made it possible to position the sheets accurately when they were perforated, and were
removed when the sheets were later trimmed. (Sheet margins are typically about 5 mm wide.)
There are intersecting vertical and horizontal lines in the four corners of the plate to indicate
where the sheets were to be guillotined. Guide marks within the plate include lines approximately
5 mm long between the stamps in the centre of the top and bottom rows, and the right and left
columns.
A number in a circle approximately 10 mm in diameter immediately above the dash in the
top sheet-margin corresponds with the number of the particular duty in the postage and revenue
series, ie the plate for the 2d duty bears the number '4', the 2s 6d, '12' and the 10s and 20s, '15'
and '16' respectively. These numbers are not reversed. Waterlow's plate number is engraved in
reverse to the right of the circle, e.g. in the case of the 2d duty '35417' is engraved in reverse to
the right of '4,' in a circle. On all four plates the plate number is also punched into the plate at topleft.
It is not reversed and was presumably added to make identification easier.
All the dies are defaced with two vertical lines. The plates are similarly defaced. The plate
for the KG VI coronation stamp differs in that it is made of steel and is defaced with closelyspaced
horizontal lines. (The format of this plate is 6 x 10.)
In a major article serialised in the Collectors Club Philatelist in 1988-89 Paul and Barbara
Kayfetz describe the dies and plates used to print the stamps and stationery in use in Malta
between 1899 and 1937, discovered in an attic in the Malta Archaeological Museum in Valletta in
1985 (Ref. 11). It was to prove an unexpected treasure trove.

The normal procedure of colonies whose postal affairs were handled by the Crown Agents
was that all such material remained in London. The printing was done by security printing
firms under scrupulously close supervisions of government auditors. When an issue was
superseded, the colonial government requested the destruction of its dies and plates.
Acquiescence of the Crown Agents was obtained, instructions were conveyed to the
custodian of the plates and dies, and formal written certification documenting the
destruction was sent to the colonial government.

Malta's first issues were printed by De La Rue; the later KG V issues, that is from 1926
onwards, were printed by Waterlow.. Bradbury, Wilkinson printed the Silver Jubilee stamps, but these plates do not survive, and De La Rue the 1937 coronation issue. No correspondence survives
from Waterlow's archives, and there appears to be no surviving correspondence relating to this
matter in the Crown Agents archives. The Kayfetzes did, however, discover relevant correspondence
in De La Rue's archives. On 30 October 1925, the Crown Agents wrote to De La Rue advising
them that the Governments of Malta and Johore had asked for the plates from which their stamps
had been printed to be forwarded to them and asking De La Rue for their comments. De La Rue
were less than enthusiastic, and replied that they could "find no exact precedent for the suggestions
now put forward. The accepted principle has been for such dies and plates to be destroyed in the
presence of your Officers." De La Rue, however, eventually agreed to the request after they had
received, via the Crown Agents, an assurance that "these obsolete dies and plates will be kept in
Malta for historical and Museum purposes only". The principle having been established, there
were evidently despatches of defaced dies and plates for later issues.
The Postmaster-General of Northern Rhodesia, who was then based in Livingstone, must
also have requested that the defaced dies and plates for issues no longer current be forwarded to
the Colony. The entry relating to Requisition 2445/4 in the Crown Agents requisition books (No.
4, p80) records the despatch of 1,243 sheets (74,580 stamps) of the 3d duty of the KG VI Coronation
issue that were urgently required. It is immediately followed by another entry numbered 2445 in
which the details are recorded only as 'ditto', and "Printing Material (defaced) for Livingstone
Museum", and the despatch date as 12 May 1938. The 'printing material' presumably included
the defaced plate for the 3d duty of the coronation issue, now in Museum Africa, but it may also
have included the plates and possibly the dies for the other coronation stamps as well as the dies
and plates for the KG V postage and revenue stamps, which would have been of no further use,
except as scrap, after the death of the monarch. Museum Africa's acquisition numbers on all the
dies and plates are in the form 44/305 to 309/A to J, ie the dies and plates were received in
Johannesburg in 1944. (The acquisition number of the plate from which the 3d coronation stamp
was printed (44/308) lies within this sequence.) This accords with the report published in The
South African Philatelist in September 1945, which stated that the dies and plates were received
"some little time ago".
All the evidence indicated that the defaced dies and plates had in the first instance been
despatched by Waterlows to Northern Rhodesia, and there was therefore the obvious possibility
that some at least had been lodged with the Livingstone Museum. This has indeed proved to be
the case. The Director, in response to a query, has listed the dies held by the Museum, but there is
no confirmation that the Museum has the missing plates. A listing of the present whereabouts of
the various dies can now be compiled as follows:

Four duties, namely the 8d, lOd, 2s and 7s 6d, are missing from the listing. However, it is evident
from the listing of the stamps sent to Northern Rhodesia (see below) that no stamps of these
denominations were despatched after April 1928, and all four duties were withdrawn in 1935
(Ref. 12). It would seem probable therefore that the dies and plates for these duties were scrapped
before the despatch of the dies and plates for other duties by Waterlows after the issue as a whole
was withdrawn. (The issue was replaced by the King George VI definitives on 1 March 1938.)
If the listing of die numbers is compared with the numbers in Waterlow's index book as
quoted by Fraser and Lowe (see above) some further conclusions can be drawn:
1 The border die for the 7s 6d duty was almost certainly numbered 10534;
2 The dies for the 8d and lOd duties may have been numbered 10503/4 or 10518/9; and
3 Although it is stated in the index book that numbers 10515 and 10516 were not used,
10515 evidently was used for the border die of the 2s 6d duty, and number 10516 may well
have been used for the 2s.

Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this listing is that there are two roller transfer dies for both
the Vzd and Id duties. The two Vid transfer dies were apparently made from the same duty die,
number 10508, but the very different 'other numbers' 4048 and 7399, would suggest that one
was made some time after the other. One of the Id transfer dies is numbered 10507 and the other 10507/15540, which could be evidence that the original Id die, 10507, was modified and
renumbered 15540. However, both dies have high 'other numbers', 7394/5, which would suggest
that they are contemporaneous. In which case why were both kept? In the absence of any relevant
documentation it is impossible to be certain of the significance of the duplication of the Vkl and Id
dies, but there must be a distinct possibility that the original plates for these two duties had to be
replaced.
There is other evidence that some duties were printed from more than one plate. The writer
has been privileged to see a complete set of this issue to the 10s duty in imprint blocks of four.
('Privileged' because imprint multiples of this issue are rare.) Only one duty, the 3s, which was
first issued in 1929, shows a 5 mm long vertical guide line between the two stamps immediately
above the imprint (see Fig. 22). Imprint multiples and single stamps with the bottom sheet margin
and half the imprint attached from other sources that have been examined clearly show a guide
line in this position, printed in the colour of the small-format postage and revenue stamps or the
colour of the frame in the case of the larger format stamps and in both cases approximately 5 mm
long. Other stamps have been seen with a guide line below or above, or to the left or right of the
top (rather than the bottom) of the design, ie from the centre of the left or right vertical columns
of a sheet, or from the top row. In addition a single used 1 d stamp has been seen which shows part
of a cross or a 'T, intersecting horizontal and vertical guide lines, that was at the centre of a
sheet. The duties so far identified as having been printed from a plate with guide lines are the Vid,
Id, l'/2d, 2d, 4d, 6d, Is, 5s and 7s 6d (Ref. 13). This list is, however, almost certainly incomplete.
Guide lines are engraved on the plate by the siderographist to assist with the laying down process,
and in particular to ensure that the reliefs are correctly aligned. They would not have been added
after the plate was made. The presence of guide lines between stamps that are known to also exist
without guide lines is therefore evidence that the stamps were printed from different plates. Bearing
in mind that comparatively few 10s and 20s stamps were printed, 46,320 and 43,600 respectively
(see Table 1), it is tempting to speculate that the plates for these two duties in Museum Africa are
the originals, and that there were similar guide marks on all the original plates for the largeformat
postage and revenue stamps (except the 3s). The plates for the 2d and 2s 6d duties held by
the Museum are evidently replacements of the originals.

There is the further possibility that guide lines of different lengths and configuration on stamps from the same position in a sheet of a particular duty will prove that some duties, and in particular the 1d, were printed from more than two plates. Further research is evidently needed, For many years the catalogues have stated that the dies for Northern Rhodesia's first
postage stamps were engraved by W.G. Fairweather. (This is also stated by Fraser and Lowe.)
However, the collection of strikes from dies engraved by J.A.C. Harrison, presented to the British
Library by his son, contains a number of items proving that the engraver was J.A.C. Harrison,
one of the great line-engravers of the 20th century. He was the son of another famous engraver,
Charles Harrison. Born on 5 August 1872, he was at first apprenticed to his father, and at the age
of 17 joined Waterlow Bros & Layton, later Waterlow & Sons. He left in the 1890s, and became
a very successful freelance engraver. In 1910 he was commissioned by the Royal Mint to engrave
dies with the portrait of the new Monarch. He also engraved the dies for the 'seahorse' high
values, and produced dies for Perkins, Bacon, but eventually agreed to return to Waterlow &
Sons. The Northern Rhodesia proofs in the Harrison Collection include six strikes on individual
squares of paper of the master die (with blank value tablets) for the small-format postage and
revenue stamps in the colours specified by the Crown Agents, though in some cases these are
slightly darker and more intense than those of the issued stamps, namely carmine-lake, green,
black (rather than grey), orange (rather than yellow-brown), blue and violet (Figure 16). The
proof in black bears at the top the number 10466 reversed and printed in black. A similar proof of
the master die for the small-format stamps struck on paper in green is illustrated as Figure 17.
The die number, 10466, is again printed in reversed relief above the proof. The manuscript
annotation reads: "As appd / 22 Oct /24", ie this proof originated from Waterlow's archives. The
Crown Agents' invitation to tender dated 31 July 1924, specified that the design for the smallformat
stamps should be for the halfpenny duty in green (see above) and this may be the reason
why this proof was printed in green rather than black.
It is tempting to speculate that the proofs/colour trials in the Harrison Collection were
struck from a series of subsidiary dies for the small-format postage and revenue stamps derived
from the master die before the figures of value were engraved on them. However, the fact that
one, printed in black, bears the number of the master die is evidence that this was not the case,
although a series of subsidiary dies must of course have been made and would have been checked.
(This would certainly have been done after the figures of value had been added.)
The author is unaware of any die proofs relating to the large-format postage and revenue
stamps other than the proof of the portrait listed and illustrated by Fraser and Lowe. As far as the
revenue stamps are concerned, the Harrison Collection includes a proof in black struck from the
master die (with blank value tablets) for the outer portion of the design (Fig. 16). The die number,
10468, is printed in reverse at the top. A duplicate proof exists in a private collection; a manuscript
annotation at bottom-right reads "Appd 23 / Oct. / 24", ie this proof also originated from Waterlow's
archives. The revenue stamps were printed in monochrome, but the only information available at
the time De La Rue and Waterlow were invited to tender was that the essay for the revenue stamp
should be for the £2 duty in black and blue. Hence the assumption that the issued stamps would
be bicoloured, and the engraving of a master border-duty die. There must also have been a keyplate
die, but neither the die nor any proofs from it appear to have survived. (The situation as far
as the key-plate die for the large-format postage and revenue stamps is concerned is the same.)
The Crown Agents' Archive, also lodged with the British Library, includes proofs/colour
trials of all the duties comprising both the dual-purpose and revenue series (but no correspondence
relating to this issue). These are in the form of imperforate stamps stuck down on cards. The
margins of the stamps are consistently 2 mm wide, which would suggest that they were printed
from dies rather than plates. There are two sets of the small-format stamps, with all the duties
from */2d to lOd represented, affixed to two pieces of card similarly annotated at top-left but
numbered '39' and '40' in red ink over 'SB 1' in pencil at top-right. The stamps are printed in the
colours of the issued stamps, except that on the card numbered '40' (Fig. 18) the IVid stamp is
printed in a slightly darker shade and has been ringed in ink. The annotation beneath the stamps
reads, "Appd for all duties / Except l!/2d [initials] 12/11". On the card numbered '39' a similar annotation reads, "Appd for lV2d July [initials] 12/11", but there are also faint annotations in
pencil, eg 'lighter' below the 6d and lOd stamps, and faint ticks below the duties from Vid to 3d
inclusive.
Similar imperforate proofs of the large-format postage and revenue stamps are affixed to
a third card numbered '41' at top-right (Fig. 19). The proofs of the 2s, 2s 6d, 5s, 7s 6d, and 10s
duties are printed in the colours of the issued stamps, but alternatives were suggested for the 20s.
The lighter shades were approved. The fourth card bears imperforate proofs of the five revenue
duties, £2 in brown, £5 in pale ultramarine, £10 in pale violet £30 in red-brown and £50 in grey
(Fig. 20). The annotation in ink reads, "Colour Scheme Appd / [initials] / 21 x 24". Close
examination of these proofs shows that the positioning of the bush scene with the animals, ie the
vignette, varies slightly with respect to the frame. For example the elephant on the £30 duty is
positioned farther to the right than on any of the other stamps, and on the £10 the elephant is
lower. Similar variations are evident on the stamps used on the document illustrated as Figure 24.
That the large format revenue stamps were printed from two plates is confirmed by similarly
different positioning of the vignette on copies of the same duty.
A 3s duty was added to the postage and revenue series in 1929. An imperforate proof in the
issued colours in the Crown Agents Archive is affixed to a square of white paper annotated "Appd
for colour, [initials] / 24/4/29." (Fig. 21). The margins are fractionally wider than on most of the
other Northern Rhodesia proofs in the Archive. The whole is affixed to a foolscap sheet of pale
green paper headed, "9 / N. Rhodesia 626" (top-left), "New 3/- denomination" (centre) and "149
/ (SB 1) / 24.4.29" (top-right).
In his article in The Northern Rhodesia Journal Fairweather refers to minor alterations to
the trunk of the palm trees and the ears of the elephants on the issued stamps compared with his
original design, but it is evident that many other changes were made. However, Fairweather's
observations are significant, as he records that the "engraver had taken a liberty with my palm
trees. He had altered the leaves from the vegetable ivory type, with its bottle-shaped trunk, to that
of the wild date type which has a uniform cylindrical stem, thus making a sort of 'combined type'
palm! . . . Also I understand that my elephants' ears are those of the Indian and not the African
type." The De La Rue essays illustrated here as Figures 3 to 8 all show the leaves of the palm
trees and the elephants' ears as Fairweather drew them, and there can therefore be little doubt that
they were developed - literally! - from his original design. The changes were introduced by
Waterlow.
The Stamps Sent to Northern Rhodesia
The numbers of stamps ordered from the printers and the numbers of sheets despatched to
Livingstone are recorded in the Crown Agents' requisition books. The data extracted from this
source are tabulated in the appendix hereto. The initial printings of all the postage and revenue
stamps were despatched in December 1924. The Postmaster-General in the first instance placed
a requisition through the Crown Agents at approximately six-monthly intervals, but the requirement
for some duties was sometimes underestimated and there were despatches to fill these deficiencies.
(Annotations in the Crown Agents' requisition books to the effect that a specific duty or duties
was urgently required is further evidence that the demand was not easy to predict.) The greatest
demand by far was for 1 d stamps, of which a total of more than 15 million were printed, but there
was also a high demand for both the halfpenny and 2d duties (approximately 6.7 and 9 million
respectively), and to a lesser extent the 6d (1.3 million). This pattern of usage was of course tied
to the postal rates and revenue use. In 1925 the inland letter rate was 2d per half ounce, the inland
postcard rate and the rate to the other territories of the African Post Union was Id, and the
overseas rate - and the rate to Nyasaland - was ll/id. The inland letter rate was reduced to Id and
the postcard rate to Vzd with effect from 1 August 1930, but were increased to Wid and Id respectively from 1 Apri] 1934. The letter rate was increased further to 2d from 15 August 1932,
but decreased to Id from 1 January 1935. Two years later it was increased again to IVid. The
airmail rates, in force from 1932, varied over a wide range depending on destination, but would
have created a demand for both 4d and 6d stamps (Ref. 14). By far the most significant revenue
usage as far as numbers of stamps were concerned would have been of Id stamps on receipts for
comparatively small amounts.
There was a marked rise in the number of stamps printed and despatched per requisition
between 1929 and 1931 in particular, when there appears to have been an attempt to estimate
requirements on an annual basis. This was evidently not entirely successful, as there were very
few stamps despatched in 1932 or 1933, presumably as a result of overestimation. The number of
stamps despatched in 1934 and 1935 was significantly less, and no stamps at all were despatched
in 1936. The final despatch was made in March 1937.
The increased demand for postage stamps in the early thirties would have come from the
comparatively large influx of Europeans involved in the prospecting and mining industries. It was
at this time that a number of important discoveries proved that the Copperbelt was a major mineral
province, and the first mines were developed. However, the prevailing worldwide depression delayed
exploitation of this potential.

2s 936 74,880 £50 42 2,520
The totals listed in Table 1 show the duties for which there was the least demand. Not surprisingly
there was little use of the small-format 8d and lOd postage and revenue stamps (29,400 and
28,560 respectively), or the large-format 7s 6d (14,000), none of these three duties was reprinted
after April 1928. The 3s duty, issued in 1929, appears to have effectively replaced the 2s, as the 2s
was another duty that was not reprinted after April 1928. (The first 3s stamps were despatched
early in June 1929, and theoretically could have been on sale in July and possibly even before the
end of June.) Usage was in any case low. The total number of 2s stamps despatched was 74,880,
compared with 70,000 3s stamps.

The total number of revenue stamps despatched between 1925 and 1931 was only 37,200,
of which almost half (17,580) were £2 stamps. No revenue stamps, and no 20s stamps, were
despatched between 1932 and 1937. The rarest revenue stamp in terms of the numbers printed is the £30, of which only 1,680 were printed compared with 2,520 £50 stamps.

The basic design of the dual-purpose postage and revenue stamps issued during the reign of
King George VI remained the same, except that the portrait of the monarch now faced right and the tablet bearing the words 'POSTAGE & REVENUE' was removed. The stamps issued in 1953 differed only in that they featured a left-facing portrait of Queen Elizabeth. It was evidently intended that both the KG VI and QE II stamps should be used for both postage and revenue purposes, and it was probably because the demand for high-value revenue stamps was so low,
that no high-value stamps specifically for revenue use were printed during the reign of King
George VI. Barefoot and Hall state that the King George V revenue stamps "continued in use
until at least 1959" (Ref. 15), presumably until stocks were exhausted. (An example of usage in
1947 is illustrated as Figure 23.) However, it was decided in 1953 to overprint selected duties of
the QE II issue with an upper case 'R' for revenue use. The overprinting was probably done
locally. The duties concerned were: Vid, Id, 3d, 6d, Is, 2s 6d, 5s, 10s and 20s. Some two years
later a new series using the QE II design but with a tablet under the portrait carrying the word
'REVENUE' was issued. The duties were the same as the overprinted stamps with the addition of
a 2s and a £50, both in what was originally the large-format postage and revenue design. All the
stamps, including the large-format types, were printed in monochrome.
