Northern Rhodesia was created in 1911 from territory administered by the [British South Africa Company](../BCA/Introduction), becoming an official British protectorate in 1924, and achieving independence as [Zambia](../zambia/Introduction) in 1964. The geographical, as opposed to political, term "Rhodesia" referred to a region generally comprising the areas that are today Zambia and Zimbabwe. 

With effect from 12 September 1923, the 33rd anniversary of the arrival of Cecil Rhodes' Pioneer Column on the site of Salisbury (now Harare), the settler population having rejected in a referendum the option of joining the Union of South Africa, that part of Rhodesia lying between the Limpopo and Zambezi Rivers was formally annexed to the British Crown as a self-governing colony.

Letters patent granting responsible government to Southern Rhodesia were issued on 1 October. Six months later, on 1 April 1924, responsibility for the administration of the territory north of the Zambezi was transferred from the British South Africa Co (BSAC) to the Colonial Office, and Northern Rhodesia became a British Protectorate. Both Southern and Northern Rhodesia continued in the first instance to use Rhodesian (BSAC) stamps and postal stationery. Southern Rhodesia issued its own stamps on 1 April 1924, but it was not until 1 April 1925, that Northern Rhodesia followed suit. The Admiral stamps of Rhodesia, first issued in 1913, remained valid for postal use in Southern Rhodesia until 30 April 1924, and in Northern Rhodesia until 30 September 1925. Rhodesian (BSAC) revenue stamps presumably continued to be valid for use for the same periods.


In the 1890s, mail from North-Western Rhodesia was carried by runner to Bulawayo, while North-Eastern Rhodesia mail went via British Central Africa until 1895.[1]

Before and after its creation, Northern Rhodesia used the stamps of Rhodesia. The change to protectorate included a change of stamps, and on 1 April 1925, Northern Rhodesia issued its first stamps. Inscribed "NORTHERN RHODESIA", the seventeen values all depicted a wilderness scene with elephants and a giraffe, surmounted by a profile of King George V. The same design was adapted for King George VI in 1938.

Northern Rhodesia's first commemorative stamps were a set of five on 30 May 1953, marking the birth centennial of Cecil Rhodes, along with another stamp issued on the same day for the Rhodes Centenary Exhibition. As Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom was already on the throne, the stamps included her profile, even though the official coronation stamp did not come out until 2 June. This was followed in September by a definitive series using the same design as before, with the monarch's profile updated once again.

Northern Rhodesia joined the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953, and used the Federation's stamps until it was dissolved in 1963. On 10 December 1963, a new definitive series depicted the Queen and the territory's arms, but these were withdrawn on 23 October 1964 when Zambia became independent.

The first stamps of independent [Zambia](../Zambia/Introduction) were issued on 24 October 1964. They consisted of a set of three commemoratives. On the same day, a set of 14 definitives was issued, with depictions of various professions and scenes.

\section{The Design of Northern Rhodesia's First Stamps}

The story behind the design of Northern Rhodesia's first stamps, which was unique to the colony
and was used for three successive definitive issues featuring three different monarchs, begins
with a letter from the Crown Agents dated 11 July 1924, addressed to Thomas de la Rue & Co
(The only surviving documents relating to this issue are in De La Rue's correspondence books,
now lodged with Royal Mail Heritage Services, at Mount Pleasant, London).

\begin{letter}
I have to inform you that a new issue of postage stamps for Northern Rhodesia has been
authorised to be supplied in the design of the Nyasaland type, incorporating the words
"Northern Rhodesia". I have therefore to request that you will proceed at once with the
preparation as far as possible of the necessary new border duty plates, and we will advise
you at a later date of the denominations which will be required. A sketch of the border
duty plate with the wording should be submitted to us for approval. You should note that
these stamps are most urgently required and they should be delivered to our inspector not
later than the end of September.
\end{letter}

Thus the original proposal was to use De La Rue's key-plate design, which was then being used
for the stamps being printed by De La Rue for Nyasaland and a number of other colonies. Three
days after receiving this letter De La Rue responded as follows:
We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th inst. with reference to a new issue
of Postage Stamps for Northern Rhodesia in the design of the Nyasaland type. As requested,
we have pleasure to submit for your approval sketches in both postage and receipt size of
the wording necessary for the border duty plates. The Postage and Revenue dies have been
used for the sketches, and we should be glad to know if these are to be followed, or Postage
only. Respecting the denominations required, we shall be obliged if you would kindly
state when ordering the sizes to be used for each. We have noted the urgency of the
requisition, and will proceed with the engraving immediately upon receipt of your approval.

The sketches submitted by De La Rue were, a) a print
of the master die for the border-duty plates for the smallformat
Nyasaland stamps with the value (3d) and the
words 'NORTHERN RHODESIA' painted in Chinese
white into the value tablets and the tablet below the
space for the King's portrait respectively, and b) a print
of the border-duty die for the 10s, as an example of the
large-format design, with the words 'NORTHERN
RHODESIA' painted in Chinese white in the bottom
tablet. Both essays were mounted on cards dated
"14.7.24", and both cards were annotated "Appd /
(initials) / 14/7/24" in manuscript. The present
whereabouts of these essays is not known, and the only
illustrations available are a poor photocopy replacing
the page in De La Rue's correspondence book on which
they were mounted, and an illustration in a Robson Lowe

The Crown Agents, having approved these essays the day they were submitted, ie 14 July
1924, returned them the same day together with the following letter:

\begin{letter}
Referring to your letter of to-day's date, we return herewith duly approved the sketches for
the wording of both postage and receipt size stamps for Northern Rhodesia. The wording
"postage and revenue" as in the present dies is to be followed. The denominations of the
new issue and the suggested colours are as follows:

\end{letter}

1/2 d Green 6d

1d Brown 8d

I 1/2d Red lOd

2d Orange l/-

3d Dark Blue II-

4d Mauve

2/6 Black with Green Head
5/- Grey with Mauve Head
7/6 Violet with Black Head
10/- Green with Black Head
207- Red with Purple Head

De La Rue duly acknowledged receipt of these instructions on 16 July:
We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th inst. returning, approved, the
sketches for the new issue of Postage and Receipt Stamps. As arranged verbally, the
engraving of the values '/id to I/- only will be proceeded with pending further instructions.
The suggested colours have been noted, and a colour scheme will be submitted for your
approval as quickly as possible.
The proposed issue of stamps was, however, to prove less straightforward than either party had
thought. The Crown Agents must have received revised instructions from the Colony, as on 26
July they telephoned De La Rue instructing them to suspend further work on the issue. This
advice was confirmed in a letter dated three days later:

In confirmation of our telephone conversation of the 26th July I have to request that you
will arrange to suspend further work in connection with the preparation of the border duty
plates of the Nyasaland type for the Northern Rhodesia stamps. We understand that the
expense so far involved amounts to about £45.0.0. Kindly confirm.
De La Rue replied on 7 August confirming that they had suspended work on the dies and plates,
and stating that "The expense involved so far amounts to £34". On 12 August De La Rue were
informed that the "instructions to
prepare the Nyasaland type of
border-duty plates\ldots should be
cancelled and the cost of £34, being
the expense involved, should be
invoiced to us as usual". The
invoice "for work on the Northern
Rhodesia dies and plates" was duly
forwarded on 21 August.

A letter dated 31 July from
the Crown Agents to De La Rue,
which must also have been sent to
Waterlow & Sons (see below),
explains the reason for the
instruction to abandon work on the
key-plate design:

The Government of Northern
Rhodesia has in contemplation
an issue of postage and revenue
stamps, and has asked us to
obtain designs and prices. You
are therefore invited to submit
three finished and coloured
designs, and prices for the
supply of stamps based on the
material given in the enclosed
tender.
The three designs, one
of each of the three sizes of
stamps specified should show
the VvA duty in green, the l/-
duty in black and orange and
the £2 in black and blue. The
largest size of stamps are to be
marked "Revenue" only. It is
intended that these stamps be

(illustrated courtesy of Royal Mail Heritage Services)
produced by the copper plate or "intaglio" process, and quotations should clearly show (1)
the cost of printing the stamps, including the cost of paper (2) the cost of dies and plates,
and (3) the cost, if any, of renewal of plates. It is estimated that the annual requirements of
postage stamps will be about 2,100,000 and until such time as further details of the quantities
of each value are known the quotation should be based on this figure. The designs and
quotations should be in our hands not later than noon on Tuesday 26th August.
The "material given in the enclosed tender" referred to in the first paragraph of this letter appears
to have consisted of at least two documents. The first read as follows:
The general design of the stamps is to be based on the rough sketch which may be seen on
application at the office of the Crown Agents for the Colonies with the following
modifications:

1. The numeral indicating the denomination to be removed from above the crown and
the crown with the oval bearing the head of His Majesty the King to be taken to the
top edge of the stamp.

2. The ribbons containing the words "Northern Rhodesia" to be removed and

3. the denomination shown in the top left and top right corners in place of the curled
terminals.

4. The word "Threepence" removed from the ribbon at the bottom of the oval bearing
the King's Head, and the words "Northern Rhodesia" inserted therein, or alternatively

5. The words "Northern Rhodesia" to be [sic] appear at the extreme foot of the design.
The stamps are to be produced by the copper plate or intaglio process, the pence values in
ordinary postage size, the shillings values in a larger size as specified above. The whole
issue is to be printed on CA watermarked white paper. The quantities of postage stamps
required for one year over the range of denominations Vkl to 207- is about 2,100,000
details of quantities for each duty will be notified later. A proof of the colours selected is to
be submitted to the Crown Agents for approval before printing is commenced. The
production is to be under the control of the Crown Agents' Chief Inspector of Stamps, to
whom supplies are to be delivered.
