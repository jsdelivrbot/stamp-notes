# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Tuvalu

Tuvalu is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia. Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, [Nauru](../nauru/introduction), [Samoa](../samoa/introduction) and [Fiji](..fiji/introduction). It comprises four reef islands and five true atolls. Its population of 10,472 makes it the third-least populous sovereign state in the world. In terms of physical land size, at just 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi) Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world.

Tuvalu was formerly the Ellice Islands, part of the [Gilbert and Ellice Islands](../gilbert-and-ellis-islands/introduction) which split into [Kiribati](../kiribati/Introduction) and Tuvalu upon gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1978 and 1979.[1]


## First stamps

The first stamps of Tuvalu were overprinted stamps of the [Gilbert & Ellice Islands](../gilbert-and-ellice-islands/Introduction) issued on 1 January 1976.
