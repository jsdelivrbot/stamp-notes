\chapter{Introduction}

The Postal history of Lubeck in its early periods is connectedd with the courier services
which even preceded the establishment of the Hanseatic Leaguec. They became highly developed only in the 16th century, when courier routes between the member cities of the league and the neighbouring countries were in operation. At the same time, the first foreign mail services took hold in the city, first the "Reichspost" of the Thurn and Taxis
family, which was introduced in Lubeck in 1579 by a decree of Emperor
Rudolph. It served especially the international
mails. A Danish post office was opened in 1650 which later became one of the tln·oo 
Danish main post offices ("Oberpostamt") J tho other ones behlg in Copenhagen
and Hamburg. 

The Lubeck city started to create its own postal service, the "Stadtpost"
in 1624 when the first "Botenordnung" was published. 

A regular mail coach service instead of the courier service to Hamburg
was established in 1650.
