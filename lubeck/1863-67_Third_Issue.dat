# 1863-67 Third Issue

In consequence, it is said, of the
stamps being extensively counterfeited
it was decided to issue a new series
and the order for these was placed with
the Royal Prussian Printing Establishment
at Berlin. As it was determined
of the series they replaced the design
being alike for all five. In the center
are the Arms of Lubeck on an upright
oval of solid ground, around which is
an engine-turned band inscribed "LUEBECK"
in its upper portion and
"SCHILLING" at the base, while the
numerals denoting the values are shown
on uncolored discs at the sides. The
stamps were embossed in color on plain
white wove paper in sheets of 100 (10
rows of 10) and, as in the case of most
other embossed stamps produced at this
establishment, the rows were numbered
in the margins. The stamps were rouletted
11 1/2 in line.

These new stamps were first placed
on sale on July 1st, 1863, when the
preceding set ceased to be issued,
though their use was permitted until the
end of the year as a convenience to the
general public. The quantities printed
were as follows :

1/2 sch 1,200 sheets = 120,000 stamps.

1Isch 800 sheets = 80,000 stamps.

2sch 1,200 sheets = 120,000 stamps.

2 1/2sch 500 sheets = 50,000 stamps.

4sch 800 sheets = 80,000 stamps.

This parcel was dispatched from Berlin
in June, 1863, and no more of the 2,
2 1/2, and 4sch were printed. A further
supply of 240 sheets of the  sch (24,000
stamps) was printed in October, 1865,
and a second supply of the 1 schilling,
consisting of 200 sheets (20,000 stamps)
was printed in May, 1867.

This latter differs from the others in having a
gauge of ten for the roulette. The color was also different from the Isch issued
in 1863, the shade being orange instead of the previous orange-vermilion.
