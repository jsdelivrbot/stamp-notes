# Second Issue 

\heading{Michel 6-7}

The quantites printed of the 1/2 and
1sch would appear to be ridiculously
small but they lasted nearly two years. A further printing was made in 1861
consisting of 1100 sheets (110,000
stamps; of the 1/2 sch and 499 sheets
(49,900 stamps) of the 1sch.

As no more of the fancy paper watermarked
with myosotis flowers was available ordinary
umwatermarked white wove paper was used. The same stones were
used and with the exception of the paper the stamps are exactly like those
of the preceding issue. These two varieties are said to have been issued in
September, 1861.
