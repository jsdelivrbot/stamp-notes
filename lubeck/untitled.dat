THE FIFTH ISSUE.
On October 1st, 1865, the postage between
Lubeck and Travemund on the
one side, and Hamburg, Bergedorf and
Geestacht on the other was reduced to
\ l/2 schilling, and a stamp to provide for
the new rate was ordered from Berlin
together with an envelope of similar
value. The first supply of 202 sheets
(20,200 stamps) was sent in November,
1865. and a second supply of 200 sheets
(20,000 stamps) was despatched in May,
1867, these being printed in a brighter
tint. The design is similar to that of
1863 except that the inscribed band is
octagonal instead of oval while the rectangular
form is obtained by the filling
of the angles with engine-turning.
These were rouletted 11^ in line like
the emission of 1863.

This was the last special stamp issued
by the Lubeck administration (though
there was a later printing of the 1sch

absorption by the North German Confederation
on January 1st, 1868.
