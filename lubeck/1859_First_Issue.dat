# 1859 First Issue

The status of these stamps was similar
to those of Hamburg, save that none
of the values singly were able to frank
a letter beyond
the confines of Germany.
In the "Why and Wherefore of Various
Stamps," published in the Philatelic
Record in 1906, Mr. R. R. Thiele gives
some interesting and valuable information
regarding the postal rates, etc.,
which we cannot do better than reproduce
in his own words :

The first issue did not make its appearance
until 1859. At that time Luebeck
had three post offices : that of
the city itself, one of Thurn and
Taxis, and one of Denmark. The
two latter had been using stamps for
several years and the force of public
opinion finally prevailed upon the
postal authorities of the Free City to
issue stamps also. The values of the
first issue were selected for the rates
most in use. The one-half schilling
stamp representd the rate on city letters
for local delivery, and also on local
printed matter. The one schilling
stamp was intended for the other city
(there is only one, Travemuende)
and villages within the territory of the
Free City, as well as those post-offices
in the neighbouring Duchy of Mecklenburg-
Schwerin which lay within
three German miles of Luebeck. Two
schillings was the rate to Hamburg
and Bergedorf, hence the stamp of
this value. To most of the post-offices
within the two Duchies of Mecklenburg-
Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz
the single letter rate was two and
one-half schillings, and hence a stamp
of this value was found necessary.
Finally the four schilling stamp represented
the single rate on letters destined
to points in the territory of the
German-Austria postal union more
than twenty German miles from Luebeck
(about ninety statute miles).
The rate to certain offices in Mecklenburg-
Schwerin was one and one-half
schilling and that to other offices between
ten and twenty German miles
distant was three schillings, but for
some reason stamps of these values
were not issued.

In 1862 or 1863 the postal authorities
received word from London that
the stamps of Luebeck had been counterfeited
there. This was, perhaps,
not very difficult, considering their
lithographic production. At all events
the authorities decided to discontinue
their lithographed stamps and to make
use of steel engraving in the future.
They, therefore, ordered the next set,
that of 1863, from the Royal Prussian
Printing Establishment at Berlin. It
is related that the price of the die and
plates nearly gave the Luebeckers a
fit, but that the expense, to their great
joy, was soon counter balanced by the
orders of the stamp collectors of the
time, who bought large numbers of
the pretty labels. The values represent
the same rates as before.

In 1864 the war with Denmark broke
out and the Duchies of Schleswig and
Holstein were occupied by the Federal
troops. Correspondence for these
two Duchies from Luebeck had formerly
been handled by the Danish
office at Luebeck, but this office was
now closed because of the war and the
city post office took charge of all mail
for the duchies. The Danish rate had
been four skillings, equivalent to one
and one-fourth schillings in Luebeck
currency ; hence the department- issued
a new stamp of the latter value.

As it had to be provided in a hurry
it was not engraved and printed in
Berlin like the set then current, but
was lithographed by Rahtgens at Luebeck.

In 1866 the rate was raised to
one and one-half schilling and the one
and one-fourth schilling stamp was
then discontinued.

As above mentioned the rate to
Hamburg and Bergedorf was two
schillings. In 1865 this rate was lowered
to one and one-half schillings
and a stamp of this value was issued.
It was again printed at Berlin, but it
was not ready on the date when the
reduced rate went into effect and the
official notice, with charming simplicity,
points out that the postage might,
nevertheless, be made up by means of
the one schilling and the half schilling
stamps.

## The First Series

Lubeck issued its first series of adhesive
postage stamps on January 1st,
1859, the values being 1/2, 1, 2, 2,y2 and
4 schilling. Their use was entirely optional
but when used the public were
requested to affix them to the left upper
corner of the face of the letter and this
continued to be the recognised mode of
affixing the stamps until 1864. Official
proof of this is found in the stamped
envelopes those issued in 1863 shew
the stamp in the upper left hand corner,
while those issued in 1864 have the label
in the right upper angle.

The design is the same for all five
values and shows the Arms of Lubeck
on a field d or (represented heraldically
by a dotted ground) within three
scrolls arranged in the form of an inverted
horseshoe. The lower of these
scrolls contains the word "POSTMARKE,"
the one at left contains the
value in words, and that on the right
is inscribed with the word "SCHILLING."
In a straight line at the top is
"LUBECK" while in each of the
angles the value is shown in white
figures on a ground of solid color. The
spaces between the corners are linked
up by ornamental lines and the whole
is enclosed within a single line rectangular
frame.

Who was responsible for the design
stamps were manufactured by H. G.
Rahtgens, a printer engaged in business
in Lubeck. The method employed was
lithography and minute differences in the
designs for each value show that a
special die or drawing was made for
each. From the original design in each
case one hundred transfers were taken
and arranged on the lithographic stone
in ten horizontal rows of ten.

In making up the stone for the 2
schilling two transfers of the 2J^sch
were accidentally inserted in the bottom
row. The mistake was discovered before
any of the stamps were printed and
to remedy it the lithographer removed
the numerals "2 1/2" from each of the
four corners of the offending labels and
drew in the correct figures "2." He,
however, omitted to alter the inscription
showing the value in words so that
these two stamps, printed in the correct
color for the 2sch and showing the
correct value "2" in the corners are,
nevertheless, wrongly inscribed 2^sch
as shown by the lettering "ZWEI EIN
HALB." The errors occurred on the
sixth and seventh stamps of the lower
row.
