# Postmarks and Cancellers

The history of the Postmarks of Lubeck
can he divided into three parts, namely those
of the 18th century, those during the Napoleonic
period and the French occupation, and
those after the liberation, from 1814 onwards.

Only of the "Reichspost", the Thurn and
Taxis mail organization, are 18th century
postmarkks known. They were straight line
LUBECK in Roman capitals, without date,
which exist in two types. They have the
first letter enlarged and are known a early
as 1784.

In 1802, as the first effect of the Napoleonic
Wars, in accordance with the 1801
treaty between the "Reichspost" and France,
the former introoduced in Lubeck postmarks
which had "R4" added to the town name
the straight line postmark R.4 LUBEK in
Italics, 'which exists in several types, was
used until the closing of the "Reichspost"
office by the Freudl in 1806. 

The post office of a French sattellite country, the Grand
Duchy of Berg, which replaced it, first
continued to use the Last "Reichspost" postmark
after changing the last letter, creating
a postmark 'with thc French spelling R.4.
LUBEC. But a few months later a new
postmark LUBEC R.4 with the indication
B.G.D. (Bureau General Ducal) and date
with year in a second line was introduced.

A similar postmark, inscribed LUBEC
R.G.D./DE MESSA, and date with year
was used for money letters and parcels.
"MESSA" is the abbreviation of "Messagerie",

When the post office of the Grand
Duchy of Berg was replaced in 1808 by a
French post office, the latter used similar
postmarks, an with the "R.4" indication, one
of them with additional "B.J. de F."
(Bureau Imperial de Francee) and date with
year in e second line. 

When Lubeck became  part of the French Department 128,
new postmarks were introduced in 1811, which had "128" above "LUBECK" and
"B. DE L'ELBE" below, but no date. Similar postmarks with addcd "P.P." for paid
letters, and "DEB" (D\'ebours\'e) for forwarded and rerated letters, were also in use.


Already in the last years of the French
occupation, ·the "Stadtpost", which was the
only postal organization permitted to operate
simultaneously with the French one, started
to use postmarks in 1810. 

The first postmark was a dateless straight line  ST. P. LUB.
It was followed from 1813 011 by various
straight lines with date and year in a second
line, one of them, of 1817, in Old English
type.

On several of those postmarks, the
town name was preceded by "St.P.", or
"S.P." or "P.A.". The last one, without
such indication, remained in use until 1844,
when it was replaced by a double circle
LUEBECK with date (day and month in
figures) in the center and the year date at
bottom. 

In 1852, the year date was replaced
by an hour indication. In 1855, a similar
postmark, but with F.P.A (Fahr-Post-Amt)
at bottom was introduced for money
letters and parcels only. 

In 1858, another double circle postmark with a small ornament
replacing the hour indication, came into use.

### Re-opening of Reichpost

After the French had left Lubeck, the
"Reichspost" office was the first of the
foreign postal organizations to reopen, on, 
January 8, 1814. 

At first, a dateless R.4.
LUBEK iin Italics was again used. Soon
afterwards, a straight line R.4 LUBECK
with date and year was introduced, of
which sevelal types exist, 

These postmarks were replaced in 1818 by a semi-circular
type, similar to those used at Bremen and
Hamburg, inscribed LUBECK/F.TH.u.TAX.P.A.
and date, with or without year date.
This type remained in use for the remainder
of the pre-stamp period.



'I'he post office of Hanover used postmarks
from 1814 on, first ::t. dateless straight line
"T.iibeek" in script letters. H was followed
ill the earlj' twenties br a dateless stra.ight
line LUBECK in Romall capitals and a few
yenrs hlter by a postmal'k with a w:wj'-line
frame, LUBECK, date (day and m'onth in
let,tel's) in :~ sccoml line. 'I'hese two postmarks
remained in use until the closing of
the H:movcr post office in 1845.

'I'he D(lJIi~h post office wa.s, during a. large
Il:II't of the pre-sttlln]) period, managed by
the "Stadt,post", and onl}" few postmarks are
known. One, in usc from the twenties, is a
straight line, K.D.P.A. LUBECK in Roman
capibls, with tlle dnte (day, month and
yoar) in a second line. In 1852, when the
Danish post office again stluted to opcr:lte
separately, a single circlc K. D. O. P. A.
J...1JRECK in Roman ctlpit:lls with date (day
{Ind month ill figures) nnd year in the
ccnter was introduced.

The post offices at the mil-road station
lIsed double circle postmarks, the HStadtpost"

of tile Danish post office had the inscription
BAII!\lI. LUEBECK/K. DAEN. POS'!' with
the dtlte and train number in the center; it
w"s in usc from 1852 011. Xo pre·stamp posttnfl
rk of the Thurn tlnd Taxis railroad station
post office is hown, as this post office
was opened after the end of the pre-stamp
Veriod .

The "Stadtpost" office at Trave1niiflde
used a slllall double circle TRAVEMUSDE
with date (da) and month in figures) and
a small orllament {It bottom.

Arrival postmarks were introduced by the
"Stadtpost" in October 1852. Small single
circles with the date (day :J,lld month in
figures) and the distribution number, for
CXIlillple ;lNo.5", cftme into usc. 'l'lIe Dnnish
post office also introduced 31'1'imJ markings
nt the same time. They wcre small senticlrcles,
inscribed K.D.O.P.A., with date and
distributioll llUlllber. 

There were various M1diUOIlOl, marki11l}S for l'(~gistcrcd lcttcrs,

orclering the change in c3uccllillg
proccdure h:.IS been found-S3w the return
of the t'Own postmarks as ca.ncellers. For
tllis purpose, the mnin post officc used a
doublc circle simibu to t113t of the initial
period but slightly smaller. It had the hour
indic:ltioH, with .and ,,-ithout added lettcr, n.t
bottom: occasionally, this indiC3tion W3S
omitted. III 1864, again a speeial canceller,
:l threc-rinj! with an ''L'' ill the center, wns

mnil to Schleswig-Holstein. It is probable
th:at it replaced the Danish "3" canceller W]lell the serdce to Schleswig-Holstein was
blkcn o\'er b)' t.he "Stndtpost" on April 1,
] 864-. III 1866, a horscshoc typc postmark ·was
introduced which had LUBEOK, fhmked
by all asterisk on each side, alld the date------
day, mOllth allcl yem·-us well .qs the hour in
the cOllter. It .vas used ollly occasionally.
In 1867, the d()uble circle was replaccd by
a single circle with suns-sel·if inscrilltiollS,
LU.KB.l<JGK at top, date (day and. mouth ill
figurcs) in centcr and St. P.A. at bottom. It
w.as used for callcelliug Lubeck stalllps for
a fcw months only and therefore is found
l'ather infrequently. From March 1, 1866 Oll

section of the main post office. 'rhis postmark,
from the IH'e-stalllp period, with

Travelllundc also first continued its double
ci.rcle postmark, now again as canceller. A
special threc-ring canceller similar to that
at tile main lJOst office but with "T" in the
center, was introduced in 1864; it is rare,
I3S it 'I'as used only on mail to ScbleswigHolstein.

A circular m<l.l'kilJg B.K.L. (BriefKastCll

in lettcl' boxes.
Whcll during the 1848 tebeHion against
DeUlll<lI'k Schleswig-Holstein introduced postage
stamps, tltey were also used by the Schles_
wig-Holstein nwil service in Lubeck, COILductcd
uy the "Sta.dt.post". As at the post
offices in Schleswig-Holstein, special cuncellers
wero llsed which were circles of bars
with n numer~J1 in the ccnter, "20" for Luuuek.
'f)le double {'ircle LUgBECK of tbe
·'Sta(1tpost", with year date at bottom, was
ShllJlLJeLl alollgside the adhesives. Sometimes
the use of the "20" canceller was 'omitted and
the town postmark also used to cancel the
stamLJs.

The Thurn and Taxis postal service, which
first introduccd stamps on January 1, 1852,
used its 1st pre-stamp postmark, the semicircle
with year date, as a canceller. But 011 July 1) 1853) ill accordance with the

WCl'e gt"tldually withdrawn in the lllothel'
country, the towu postmal'ks were more fre·
quently used :.is eaucellers, toward the eIHl
probably exclush-el,Y. '1'he first postmark
Ilsed during the stamp period was the prestfttllp
single cil'cle li.D.O.P.A. LUBgCK ill.
Homan c~,pitals, with (late all.d )'ear. It was
replaced in 1863 by a single circle with the
S<.lme inscription, but now in Sil..us-serif
cllpltnls alHI with the how' illstead of the
yelll'. Tlle D'1l1ish post office at the railroad
station used a "3" cnlJceller for the stamps
a.ll(l put t1le Inc-stamp double circle alongside
on the mail. The "3" canccller exists in
114
llcyer:l.l t,}'pes, onc of which was for some timc
so worn that it showed oul)' traces of the
outer circle and looked like a. doublc-ring
canceller. '1'he Danish stamps 011 mail obtJaiued
from the subordinated Jotter collecting
agellcies at Gross-Griirmu (Laucl1burg) anu
l~cinfeld (Holstein), which had no postmarks,
were c..'\ncelled by the Danish post
office at Lubcek in the same wa)' .')8 those
posted at Lubeck proper. Only manuscript
llotations on the mail-town llamc and date
-disclosc the origin.
'Phe last town postmarks of the three
"Stadtpost" offices wore continued in use
:tfter January 1, 1868, 311<1 they can be
found on stamps of the North German
Confedcl'M&m, the }'ni lroad station and
'1'I':wemiillde postmarks also on the 1872 issue
of the Germ.an Empire.

Summarizing the use of the various cancelling
methods first for the "Stadtpost",
it seems obvious from the regulations that
the 1859 issue is most frequently found with
the five-bar canceller. 

A little less frequent
is the pen cancellation, but it is so Ulll)opular
that copies off cover do not fetch more than
ulillsed OIlCS, and even authentic examples Oil
cO\'er, with the town postmark alongside,
sell for a fraction of the price of covers on
which the stamps are cancelled by a. postlIlark.
Cancellation by the town postmarks
was III rcgnlnf use Ollly for two mOllths and
is thercfore the raJ'cst kind of callcellation
on the 1859 issue, a.lthough oceasional cancellations
of this kind occurre<1 also in later
years. CbecuJ.lg of the available material of
used stamps of the 1859 issue reveals that
nbout 75% -of aU stmups show bar cancellation
ami only 12,U% each c.ancellatioll
by 11.. town postmark or pen cancellatiou. The
1862 stamps without watermark were regularly
cancelled only by the five-bar callCcllet';
they dQ not come pell-cancelled on
ma.il, :'lIld e..·L.llcelJation with a town postmark
is a rare exception. The 1863 issue was at
first, for a little more than a ye:lr, ca.ncelled
with the fi\'e-b.al' cancellel·s. It is considerably
rarcr .in this concUhon-altbough less
popuktr-thall ·with a. C3ncellation by a town
postmark, which was practised for three and
a half :re:ll's. 'I'he 1348 of 1864 was intrOdueed
just bef-ore the fi,-e-bar cancellers
were discontinued) therefore it is raro with
such 11.. cancellation, the regula.r oue bcblg
with a town postmark. The latter kind of
cancell:ation can be foull(l almost exclusively
011 the ] ~s of 1865. AU other kinds of postllHl.!'ks,
SUell as tho "J.l' and "1'" cancellers,
the postmarks of '1'ravemuude and those of
the tnwclling railroad post offices, are much
s~.lrcer than the regular postmarks, as nrc
..til blue cancellations.

The envelopes were cancelled in the same
way as the adhesives. all tlte 1863 issue, we
find llwiuly the five-bar canceUer, much less
fl't,'<luelltiJ' a town lJostm"lrk, used to caucel
the sblmp. Por a. short period the 1864 issue
was also caneellcd with the fh-e~b3r canceller,
whi<:h is scarce on this issue, then with the
\"tLrious town postmarks, as well as the "L"
~~Ilc1 "'1''' cancellers, an of which are the ollly
cailcellatiolls found on the 1865 and 1867
cnvelopes
