Until 1864 Denmark had maintained
a post-office in Lubeck but when, owing
to the war, the duchies of Schleswig,
Holstein, and Lauenberg were detached
from Denmark this office was abandoned.

Mail for the duchies was then handled by the city Post the rate on
single letters being fixed at  1 1/4sch. As
there was no stamp of that value or a
1/4 sch by means of which the rate might
be made up in conjunction with a 1sch
stamp had to be issued and as
the demand for this- was somewhat urgent
it was decided to produce it locally
by lithography rather than wait for a
supply from Berlin. H. G. Rahtgens,
who produced the first series, was entrusted
with the manufacture of this
 1 1/4 sch label. The design is a palpable
copy of the embossed stamps and shows
the Arms of Lubeck on a dotted ground
within an upright oval band inscribed in
a similar manner to the stamps of the
1863 series. 



The stamps were lithographed
in sheets of 100 and there were
two printings. The first of these took
place in March, 1864, when 525 sheets
(52,500 stamps) were printed and the
second was made in November of the
same year when 517 sheets, or 51,700
stamps were prepared. They were issued
imperforate and a number of different
shades may be found.
