\chapter{1898 Landing on Trinidad}

Trinidad had the honour to be the first Colony which marked the commemoration of an event in its own history. On January 26, 1898 the Crown Agents sent to De La Rue for report the following letter from the Governor of the Colony to Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, who was then Secretary of State for the Colonies:

The 31st of July 1898 will be memorable in the annals of Trinidad on account of its being the 400th anniversary of its discovery by Columbus. On that day in the year 1498 he sighted the Trinity Peaks on the South Coast of Trinidad and at the sme time first saw the Main Land of the Western Hemisphere.

It is my intention to celebrate this remarkable event during the visit of the North Americn and West Indian Squadron in February next, on which subject I shall address you in a separate despatch, but I desire to have a lasting memorial in the issue of a commemorative Stamp, in which desire my Executive Council concurs.

The postage for all letters between all parts of Her Majesty's Empire is about to be reduced to twopence, so that a new Stamp of that value will be required and I think this twopenny Stamp might well be made commemorative of Columbus' discovery of Trinidad.

I propose that 500,000 of this Stamp should be sold to the public, after which a twopenny Stamp of the ordinary Trinidad pattern will be issued. This commemorative Stamp will be used for postage only so that it may be printed in any colour and of any size. All details I leave to the good taste of the Crown Agents and Messrs De La Rue and Company, but I enclose a photograph of a stained glass window which is in the Council Chamber here the design of which I should wish, if possible, adapted to the purpose. The artist would probably reduce the number of figures and otherwise alter the picture but I would like the Stamp in its main points to follow the design in the window.

It is absolute necessary that the issue should be in Trinidad by June, 1898, so as to be issued on 31st July.

I may mention that the proposed celebration and teh commemorative Stamp is eciting considerable interest, and I beg that, should you approve the proposal, as I sincerely trust you may, teh Crown Agents will be at once instructed to take the necessary steps to give it effect

\section{De La Rue preparatory work}

On February 7th De La Rue responded by sending alternative designs; one in a single colour, the others in two. 'It will be necessary to produce these stamps by the copperplate process, as it would be impossible to obtain a satisfactory result by surface printing.' De La Rue quoted \pound20 for the original plate, and \pound20 for the working plate. If the stamps were printed in two colours there would be an additional \pound8 for a duty plate, and \pound20 for a second working plate. They went on to say:</par>

\begin{quotation}
We should recommend you to have the stamps printed in two colours, as we think that a much more satisfactory result would be obtained. If you decide to do so we shall be glad if you will, as in the case of British Guiana, have the paper made 25 per cent thicker; indeed we venture to suggest that you should give a general authority for the thicker paper to be used for any Stamps printed in two colours by the copperplate process and we think you will not object to do this, seeing that Messrs. Turner have agreed to supply the thicker paper at the same price as the ordinary thickness,
\end{quotation}

The Crown Agents replied on february 10th:

\begin{letter}
We return the two designs which we like extremely, but we think the Stamp might be improved by introducing the words 'Commemoration of the landing of Columbus' in larger type, like that of teh present word 'Commemoration'. If this cannot be put in at the top of the stamp, possibly it might be arranged to take place of the pillars.

If, however, the pillars are not dispensed with then we think they would be improved by being prolonged at the bottom (something like the panel in the photograph) to take the place of the pesent square pedestrals.
\end{letter}

A revised sketch was approved by Blake and further designs were sent on February 18th. One of these, suitable for two-colour printing, was approved on February 19th, and the firm were told to go ahead. On May 11th they sent no less than thirty-seven combinations of colour scheme:

On Appendx A we beg to hand you the two combinations of colours which in our opinion give the best results for the 2d. Commemoration Stamp. In case you do not approve of either Stamp on Appendix A, we hand you on Appendix B 35 combinations for you to select from. These are only edged on, so that they can be readily detached.

It would expedite the work and be of assistance to us if you will allow us to print the vignette plate on our machine, as is the case of the British Guiana Stamps. We have so much work in hand for you at the present time taht it will occupy the presses at the Anchor Works for some months to come, even if you accede to our request.

The Crown Agents' reply was critical and they asked for more proofs.

\begin{letter}
In reply to your memorandum of the 11th inst. we think the commemoration stamps would look much better, either printed in one colour, or with a border of a slightly darker shade of the same colour.

We think the borders are all too heavy and dark and have the efect of killing the centre part of the stamp and we should like to see a few specimens both whole coloirs and darker borders of the same colour, of the shades of Sepia, Brown or Black.

We do not think blue or green would give such a good effect.

We have marked three of teh colours which appear the best in pencil.

We have no objection to the stamps being printed on your machine as is the case of the British Guiana stamps.
\end{letter}

The new specimens, with estimate, were submitted on May 23rd. Nevertheless the Crown Agents were still not satisfied. they asked to see further specimens 'with more pronounced difference in the borders'. They then raised the point of having a single colour plate instead of printing in two colours.

De La Rue reported that the extra cost of making a new printing plate would be offset by saving in the cost of printing in one colour, instead of two. They sent further colour trials on May 27th, and at last had an approved colour trial on June 1st, with a request for urgent delivery.

The firm pointed out that the plates had been ready since May 11th, when the colour trials were submitted, and that much time had been lost, but they would endeavour to get an advanced supply of 1,000 sheets away by the mail-steamer leaving on June 28th. The complete invoice was not sent until November 21st. They charged the ususal \pound20 each for Original Vignette plate and working plate; \pound8 for the original duty plate and \pound20 for the working plate; and supplied 539,400 stamps and 750 specimens.
