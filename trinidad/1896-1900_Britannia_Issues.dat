\chapter{1896-1900 Britannia Issues}


The correspondence dealing with the adoption of the Britania design by Trinidad is huge. The Crown Agents on June 24, 1895 forwarded the complete papers received from the Colony, consisting of no less than ten documents, including notes from the Governor to the Colonial Secretary about the Postmaster General's leave. As a result the preliminary negotiations were carried out with the Crown Agents by the Postmaster General in person.

The introduction of Postage and Revenue Stamps, which was the prime cause of teh change, was due to the abolition of separate Fee Stamps. The following letter from the Postmaster General, J. A. Bulmer, is interesting in that it shows how the design was originally conceived:

\begin{letter}
I have thought it might perhaps give His Excellency the Governor a better idea of the proposed new issue of Trinidad Postage and Revenue Stamps if I manufactured from teh South Australian and old Trinidad Stamps, a stamp such as is recommended by the 'Stamps' Committee and I beg to submit two specimens herewith.

Of course, I have had to use stamps of such colours as I could obtain to best suit my purpose, and it is understood taht the whole of each denomination of each stamp would be printed in one colour.

Thus, halfpenny stamps would be green, 1d. Stamps red and 2\halfd stamps blue.
