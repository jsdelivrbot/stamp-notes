\chapter{Postage Dues}

On November 13, 1883 De La Rue received instructions to prepare a die and printing plates for stamps which are still in use today. These were the Postage Dues for Trinidad, the first of their kind to be mentioned in the correspondence. The Colonies requisition was dated October 23rd, and the stamps were required by January 1st. They were described as `Surcharge Stamps'.

The firm sent the design and estimate, with proof of the overprints, on the following day. In view of the simplicity of the design they quoted \pound30 for the die and plate, and \pound3 each for the overprints. Altogether there were nine overprints, and the quantities varied from 25 to 400 sheets of 60 multiples. When approving the design and estimate on November 15th the Crown Agents said: `We trust that this order may be pressed forward as much as possible but we cannot approve the suspension of other orders except in so far as regards work that is not pressing.' The order was invoiced on January 29, 1884.
