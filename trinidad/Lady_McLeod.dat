\chapter{Lady McLeod}

The fabled Lady McLeod stamp was the first adhesive issued 
in a British Colony in April of 1847. It was issued by David 
Bryce for prepayment of mail carried between Port of Spain 
and San Fernando aboard his paddle steamer "The Lady McLeod". 
There is no value expressed but the stamp paid a fee of 5c. 
The stamps were generally cancelled by means of a pen-cross.
