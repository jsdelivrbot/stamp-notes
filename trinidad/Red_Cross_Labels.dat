When World War I broke out in August 1914 there was a desire in the British West 
Indies to assist in the struggle against Germany. Four contingents of officers and 
men were despatched and attached to the British West Indian Regiment and of the 
seven officers and three hundred and forty-five men sent to the front seventeen 
made the supreme sacrifice. 
 
All the sea island cotton grown on the islands was exported exclusively to Britain for 
aeronautical purposes. 
 
Some of the then current issues of stamps in the British West Indies were 
overprinted "WAR TAX," in theory, to raise extra revenue to help the War Effort. 
The idea was that letters posted to places abroad should bear not only the normal 
postage; but also an additional "WAR TAX" stamp.

The Red Cross in the British West Indies colonies of Jamaica, Grenada and 
Trinidad produced Red Cross letter seals or labels which were also sold by the Red 
Cross to raise funds to aid the victims of war. These charity labels were to stick on 
the back of the envelope to seal the letter. They were intended for use on letters 
posted to local addresses as well as to addresses abroad. 
 
As so often happens in the West Indies things got mixed up. Some of the general 
public had difficulty in distinguishing the difference between a postage stamp, a War 
Tax stamp and a Red Cross charity label. 
 
War Tax stamps were used fairly indiscriminately in the place of postage stamps on 
both local and long distance mail through the islands. Occasionally Red Cross 
charity labels were used as postage stamps and occasionally as War Tax stamps 
placed alongside postage stamps on letters posted to addresses abroad. 
 
Even a Red Cross charity label correctly affixed to the back of an envelope to seal it 
was sometimes cancelled by the postal authorities in the same way as the postage 
stamp on the front of the letter. 
 
Jamaica allowed their Red Cross labels to be used by the Red Cross as postage 
stamps on official Red Cross business. Trinidad authorised its Red Cross labels be 
used for postal purposes for one day only on 18th September 1914. Grenada never 
allowed its Red Cross labels to be used for postal purposes. 

The Post Office in Trinidad issued postal stamps easily confused 
with both War Tax stamps and Red Cross charity labels. These 
stamps were of the 1d Britannia issue overprinted with cross in 
Red with the outline and date 21.10.15 in black (SG.174) (Fig. 1) 
and overprinted with a cross in red and the outline and date 
19.10.16 in black (SG.175).

All the above no doubt added to the confusion in the minds of the general public. 
The result is some interesting philatelic items, involving Red Cross charity labels. 
This article is concerned solely with the Trinidad Red Cross charity label. 

The labels (fig,2) were printed by Yuilles Printerie, 13 
Chacon Street, Pod of Spain, Trinidad (who also 
printed the Grenada Red Cross labels) for the 
Trinidad Red Cross probably on the outbreak of War 
in August 1914. Unlike the Grenada Red Cross 
label, the Trinidad Red Cross charity label has only 
one design depicting a red cross in the middle of the 
label and the words "RED CROSS" and "SOCIETY" 
on the respective side edges and the word 
TRINIDAD" on the top edge above the red cross and 
the words "ONE FRACTION" on the bottom edge. 

The cross and words are enclosed within a red 
rectangular border. All labels were sold without gum 
and printed on white or cream paper, perf 11. (or was 
there a second printing with gum - see below). 

 
The words "ONE FRACTION" are used on the label instead of e.g. "One farthing" or 
"One halfpenny." Presumably the Trinidad Red Cross wanted to keep open their 
options as to the amount of the sale price which the general public was prepared to 
pay for a charity label to assist with the War Effort and without having to arrange for 
reprinting of the label. (If anyone knows differently please so state in a future 
bulletin.)

It is interesting that the Trinidad Red Cross label was authorised for use as a half penny stamp and that the second issue of the Grenada Red Cross label substituted 
the words "One farthing" for "One fraction."

The Trinidad Red Cross label was 
authorised for internal use as a 
half-penny postage stamp on one 
day only, 18th September 1914, 
to raise funds for the Red Cross. 
The Trinidad Red Cross, 
themselves, made good use of 
this facility. They sent a mail-shot 
of a circular letter (Fig.4) headed 
"Port-of-Spain 11th September 
1914," requesting charitable 
assistance towards the War Effort 
in envelopes posted on 18th 
September 1914 and bearing the 
Trinidad Red Cross label. (Fig.3). 

The circular letter in my possession bears an impression on the paper which mirrors 
the double postal cancellation on the envelope. The circular letter is headed with a 
cross in a double circle. This emblem is in the same colour red as the stamp. The 
paper is cream in colour and the same width as; but slightly shorter than A.4 paper. 
The paper is watermarked with a St. Edwards Crown and the words in block 
capitals "IMPERIAL STRONG MIL" beneath the Crown, There is a matching 
coloured envelope. The paper of the envelope is watermarked with a series of 
diagonal straight lines. 
 
The Trinidad Red Cross label was used without authority as a postage stamp on 
13.12.15. on a card to (San F)ernando (Fig.5.)

Also illustrated (Fig.6.) are a watermarked block of four labels all postmarked "ST. 
MARY'S TRINIDAD MR 29 16" with a very thin film of gum on the reverse and 
which labels have never been stuck on anything. Have the philatelic speculators 
been at work again? Was there a second printing of these labels bearing gum? 
 
In Conclusion 
 
The Trinidad Red Cross letter seal (aided by its guise as a postage stamp) helped 
the Red Cross in Trinidad both directly and indirectly to raise thousands of pounds 
for the work of the Red Cross in Europe in dealing with victims of the First World 
War. It is a fascinating philatelic item which, after more than 80 years, is still 
capable of revealing surprises.
