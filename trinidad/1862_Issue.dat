8,160 6d., green.
15,120 4d., lilac. "
72,050 id., red.

(M) This request is dated 8 October, 1861 and was received on 30 October,
1861, the stamps were ready on 21 December and were shipped on 2 January,
1862. This is the last notice of the shipment of any consignation of stamps,
which is unfortunate as it has been a vexed question how long these stamps
were used before the arrival of the next consignment which were printed by
Messrs. De La Rue and Co. 

Most authorities have held that the De La Rue
first printing arrived during the year 1863, which, as Mr. Bacon pointed out,
would give the above stamps an unusually long lease of life as no provisionals
were issued. \sidenote{On January 28, 1862, all dies, rollers and plates of Trinidad were handed to the Agents-general fro Crown Colonies, and the next supply was printed by De La Rue & Co.}

I have endeavoured to solve this question, but the evidence is not conclusive.
The Governor wrote on 7 March, 1862, (received 31 March, 1862) as follows :
" I have the honour to transmit to your Grace the usual half-yearly requisition
for a supply of postage labels." This is endorsed : " At once. This is just in
time as some are wanted for the Exhibition."

The rest is silence.

The Governor never mentions the subject of postage stamps again in 1862,
which is unusual if this " half-yearly requisition " did not arrive.
On the 25th January, 1863, he applied for " the usual half-yearly supply of
postage stamps " as if nothing had occurred to interrupt their arrival.
As regards this consignment no details are given, and I wondered if any provision
had been made for the increased postal rates between the United Kingdom
and the Colonies which came into force on April ist, 1863, for if not, the is. value
becoming exhausted, pairs of the 6d. and strips of the 4d. would abound.

I find, however, that the Governor on April 23rd applied for a supplementary
requisition " owing to the increased rate from 6d. to is. the A ounce, having been
determined after the periodical requisition for postage stamps, to be forwarded
in view of the increased demand for is. stamps." The Colonial Agents complied.
I add the next notice as it shows the number of shilling stamps wanted :—
