The correspondence between De La Rue and the Crown Agents is described by Easton who provided the full correspondence in his book. The correspondence  begins with a letter from the Crown Agents addressed to De La Rue, with the reference 98/1899 of September 28, 1899 and marked 'Urgent'.

\begin{letter}
The enclosed Requisition for a new 3d. Postage and Revenue Stamp for Trinidad is sent to you for execution. 

An overprint plate to be prepared.

Be good enough to report costs.

Specimen stamps to be sent to us in two or three colours of the overprint for approval.

The usual specimens will be required.

The indent is marked 'Urgent' please expedite supply.

When will delivery be made?
\end{letter}


The firm replied some three weks later on October 22nd 1899:

\begin{letter}
Requisition returned herewith for:-

6,000 --- 3d. Postage & Revenue Stamps.

A 60-set overprint plate at a cost of \pound12 will be required.

On Appendix hereto we hand you a specimen of the Stamps we would propose. In this, in order to make distinction, we have made the overprint a white letter on a dark background that it is impossible to get any further distinction, and therefore it appears to us unecessary 

Delivery to your Inspector is 10 weeks from the date of receiving your instructions.
\end{letter}


The Crown Agents did not approve the specimen, as they thought the contrast was not sufficient to distinguish the value from others in the existing series, and replied with the following letter:

\begin{letter}
We do not think the threepenny Stamp you propose gives at all a good contrast to teh stamps of the existing series.

Can you make any suggestions to enable us to decide on a stamp which will give a better result?

The overprint plate should not be begun until the matter is settled.
\end{letter}

De La Rue sent a further set of Specimens on October 6th:

\begin{letter}
On Appendix hereto we beg to hand you eight further combinations for you to select from. As the purple is much more largely employed in the Postage size of the Trinidad Stamps, we think that the green might give a better contrast.

In these combinations we have employed a dark letter on a white ground, but of course, if you prefer it, a white letter on a dark ground, as shown on our Appenix of October 2nd could be employed. 

We hold over the overprint plate pending your further instructions.
\end{letter}

}

At this point it appears that the Crown Agents had a different idea. They proposed to substitute a tempoarry overprint from type for a permanent duty and they raised the matter on October 11th:

\begin{letter}
We do not think any of the colours suggested will give satisfactory results and we propose therefore to send out stamps with the 3d. duty shown by means of a temporary overprint.

We think the 5d. stamp will be the best to select and we request you to furnish specimens of what you would propose --- the overprint to be as clear as possible.

We should like to see the overprint shown in bold figure --- 3d. --- as well as the words 'Threepence' and in such colour or colours as will afford the best contrast.
\end{letter}

Alternative specimens on the lines suggested were submitted on October 13th:

\begin{letter}
On Appendix hereto we beg to hand you the specimens you ask for, overprinting with the 3d. in figures and in words.

A temporary plate will be necessary, at a cost of \pound3. 3. 0, and the overprinting of teh Stamps would be 6d. per thousand.

The Crown Agents approved one of the specimens on October 18th:

\begin{letter}
We return the colour scheme of the 13th instant with the 3d., overprint initalled.

The Stamps should be put in hand at once and we hope there will be no difficulty in finishing them in time for delivery in Trinidad early in December --- with the other stamps ordered under Req. 99/99.
\end{letter}

The stamps can be found unused, but is rare. A mint example from the Marriott Sale is shown in Figure~\ref{3dmint} and another on piece from the De La Rue archives (Figure~\ref{3darchive}).
