\chapter{The Too-Late Handstamps}

The Too-Late handstamps have been studied by Medlicott and published in the journal of the British West Indies Society in an article in 2004.

Stamps and covers from Trinidad and Tobago bearing ‘TOO LATE’, ‘LATE’, ‘TOO LATE FOR 
BAG’ and ‘LATE FEE PAID’ markings have attracted collectors’ attention since early philatelic 
times. On loose stamps some markings are plentiful, whilst others are of the greatest rarity; 
anything on cover is scarce to rare – the main Marriott sale on 19 September, 2001 (1) contained 
just four ‘TOO-LATE’ covers (lots 713, 714, 715 and 721), and one boxed ‘TOO LATE FOR BAG’ 
cover (lot 722) mailed on board the Cedros Steamer for London, which was knocked down for 
£2,100 plus premium. 

Bacon was at his most contemptuous when describing the TOO LATE stamps and dismissed them 
(2) thus: ‘Various stamps of certain of the preceding issues are to be met with surcharged ‘TOO 
LATE’ in black or red block letters, and with the same surcharge double or inverted. No such 
stamps were ever sold to the public in Trinidad. The varieties are entirely devoid of Philatelic 
interest, and owe their existence to obliging post office officials, the surcharges being nothing more 
than griffes de complaisance, made for the benefit (?) of collectors’. 
That Bacon’s hauteur was not shared by collectors at large is reflected in Bright’s contemporary 
catalogue (3), which listed ten stamps perf. 12½ surcharged in black, and six in red, at prices 
between ten shillings and two pounds. When compared with their list price of just £15 for a used 
Lady McLeod, it seems that the ‘TOO LATE’ stamps were in reality objects of desire. 

The earliest reference to the ‘TOO LATE’ stamps known to the writer appears in Dr. Gray’s 
Catalogue of 1875 (4), and is worth quoting at least in part if only to illustrate the curiosity which 
they obviously aroused in the minds of contemporary collectors:– “All the current stamps are found 
with the words TOO LATE printed diagonally across the face....... It is conjectured that those 
values are surcharged from time to time of which there happen to be the most in stock, and that 
once so surcharged they are sold at a low uniform rate, irrespective of facial value, which rate 
represents the extra fee claimed by the post-office on ‘too-late’ letters, and paid by the public by 
means of these surcharged stamps. How far this somewhat far-fetched hypothesis is right or not, 
we cannot say.” Indeed.

Before the introduction of the handstamps, probably in the 1860s, postmasters must have seen the  need to indicate the reason for delays to letters. Figure 1 shows an entire written in Guapo on 9  November 1861 to Chas. Fabien in Port of Spain, and posted in La Brea; the La Brea postmaster  has annotated the face in manuscript ‘too late for bag on the 9th’ and the supporting circular  datestamp (Marriott type 0.2.’20’) shows despatch by the following week’s mail on 14th November. 

Michael Hamilton records three other such covers with manuscript markings in the years 1856 to 1861. 

The writer has traced no date for the introduction of the Late Fee system itself, but the book (5) by  Joe Chin Aleong and Prouds quotes several helpful references in Post Office notices:– 

– in a footnote to a table of the West India Packet Service 1885, 
 “The hours for closing the Outward Mails will remain as at present, viz.. Letters bearing ordinary 
postage, up to 1.30p.m., with late Fee affixed up to 3p.m.” (p.79) 
– the new arrangements for late fees coming into force at the GPO on 20 August 1896, 
 “Late Fees on English Mail Day. 

Letters and other postal matter with ordinary postage may be posted at any pillar box in Port-of-Spain  and at the General Post Office up to 2.30p.m. 

Note:– Letters,, & c., posted in pillar boxes in Port-of-Spain after 2.30 p.m. on English 
Mail day will not  go forward that mail. 

Letters and Postal articles with late fee of 1d at General Post Office only, up to 3 p.m. 

Letters (but not other postal articles) with late fee of 2½d, at General Post Office only, up to 3.30 p.m. 

Letters (but not other postal articles) with the late fee of 5d, at General Post Office only, up to 4p.m. 

All posting boxes will be closed at the General Post Office at 2.30 p.m on the Outward English mail 
day and all late fee letters and local letters between that time and 4 p.m. should be handed to one 
of the counter clerks. 

From 3.30 p.m late fee letters will be received only at the stamp window, in private box department”. 
(p.95). 

Further changes to rates and times were introduced on 31 January 1903 (chronicled on p.104), so 
that it is apparent that the scale of fees was based on the time of presentation of mail for postage, 
but may also have related to the type of article (inland letter, overseas letter, registered articles, 
etc.) No reference has been unearthed to verify this second supposition, or the basis for calculating 
the scale of fees. 

\section{The Handstamps} 

The markings can be divided into four general types:

a) ‘TOO-LATE’ (with or without hyphen) 

b) ‘LATE’ 

c) ‘TOO LATE FOR BAG’ 

d) ‘LATE FEE PAID’ 

with the first three originating in the nineteenth century, whilst the fourth is not found before the  1930s. 


\subsection{TOO-LATE}

This is much the most plentiful, and complex, category. Such is the clarity and intensity of a few  examples that it is compelling to suppose that Types TL.1 and 2 are overprints rather than  handstamps, and it may be that they are bogus and deserve Sir Edward Bacon’s opprobrium (see  figure 2). Of the two examples illustrated, one is the (1d) lake of 1863; the second is the 1/-  chrome-yellow of 1872 and also bears a fully dated cds of 9 AU 1874. 

Hence 

TYPE TL.1. overprint? 27 x 3.75mm oval ‘O’s hyphen Black 
 
Figure 3 shows a second type with the characteristics of an overprint, this time in reddish-purple on  a 6d perf. 14 bright yellow green; 

Hence 

TYPE TL.2. overprint? 26 x 3mm round ‘O’s hyphen Red-purple

1877 to Georgetown, Demerara (arrival 2 FE), showing the commonest type of TOO-LATE 
handstamp, with squarish ‘O’s and a full hyphen. It can be found, quite scarcely, on cover, both 
cancelling the late fee adhesive and away (as in this case) from the adhesives. All the covers 
examined show it struck away from the adhesives where a single stamp collects the consolidated 
(postage plus late fee) rate, or where the cover is inbound (eg Marriott lot 721). Conversely, it 
cancels an adhesive where it clearly collects the late fee alone (e.g. Marriott lots 713-5). Whilst the 
consistency of the few covers available for inspection may prove this rule, it is hard to explain the 
usage, albeit rare, of this handstamp to cancel SG87, the 5/- rose-lake of 1869. Hamilton records 
16 covers and one dated piece, the earliest dated 9 JY 1867, the latest being the cover at figure 4 
(including type TL.4). 
 
 
Figure 5 (front cover) shows a remarkable OG block of 9 of SG69c, the (1d) scarlet perf. 12½ with cc watermark, each stamp precancelled with the same TOO-LATE handstamp, so precisely aligned as to suggest some form of stereo or roller cancel. This block, originally part of a larger block of 21, was the subject of an article in Stamp Collecting over the by-line ‘P.H.’ (6). 

Hence TYPE TL.3. cancel/ precancel 28.5 x 4mm squarish ‘O’s hyphen black or red 
 
Figure 6 is the type apparently listed by Chin Aleong/Proud under Port of Spain as type I3. Of the  same size as type 3, it is clearly distinguishable by its oval ‘O’s. Both handstamps were in use at Port of Spain from the 1860s to around 1880. 

Hence 

TYPE TL.4. cancel 28.5 x 4mm rounded oval ‘O’s hyphen black or red

Figure 7 shows the 5/- of 1869 cancelled by the first of the no-hyphen types in conjunction with the 
Trinidad double arc cds for NO 26 1874. 
Hence 
TYPE TL.5. cancel 27.5 x 4.5mm rounded oval ‘O’s no hyphen black 
 
These early types were succeeded at the GPO some time in the 1880s by one or more instruments 
reading ‘TOO LATE’ (no hyphen). As in figure 8, they are always placed away from the adhesives, 
and in all the examples seen by the writer, show no evidence of having collected a fee. It would 
appear, therefore, that the Late Fee system was abolished about this time, and the postmaster 
reverted to the earliest practice of using the mark to show why an item of mail had suffered delay. 
Hence 
TYPE TL.6. cancel 26.5 x 3.75mm squarish ‘O’s no hyphen black 
 
Some six other distinctive TOO LATE with or without hyphen handstamps have been identified to  date, probably belonging to San Fernando and smaller offices. Chin Aleong / Proud show an  instrument very similar to type 3, and assign it to San Fernando as I4, with a single date of use of 7  January 1911. A remarkably similar type for 7 June 1885 is assigned to Princes Town. In the  modern era, they also identify a very distinctive type measuring 33 x 5.5mm for Erin. These are  tentatively designated as types TL. 7, 8 and 9, but not illustrated here in the absence of the primary evidence. 
 
Figure 9 illustrates a cover mailed in Cedros on 24 November 1884 to Port of Spain, showing a 
large no hyphen TOO LATE handstamp (shown on p. 292 by Chin Aleong/Proud and designated 
I4) which collected no late fee, and which has also been seen on loose adhesives. 
Hence 
TYPE TL.10. cancel 34 x 5.5mm tall squarish ‘O’s no hyphen black 
Figure 9 illustrates a cover mailed in Cedros on 24 November 1884 to Port of Spain, showing a 
large no hyphen TOO LATE handstamp (shown on p. 292 by Chin Aleong/Proud and designated 
I4) which collected no late fee, and which has also been seen on loose adhesives. 
Hence

The "TOO LATE" mark can be found as late as 1926 (Figure~\ref{latepersia}). A cover was sold by Cavendish showing the mark in purple from Demerara to Abadan in Persia.

\subsection{LATE}

On loose adhesive, it is usually impossible to determine whether the single word ‘LATE’ is actually 
part of ‘TOO LATE’ or not. One of the only two indisputable examples known to the writer is on the 
cover illustrated as figure 12. This is an envelope from Port of Spain to Paris 27 AP 1881 (arrival 
14 mai), also showing red ‘3’ in manuscript, suggesting 4d postage and 4d Late Fee – the latest 
cover of the early period so far seen on which a fee was levied. The cover is also interesting in that 
it shows the error of date ‘1818’ for 1881 in the Trinidad double arc datestamp. This was one of two 
similar instruments in use concurrently, one of which shows the error of year on this date only (and 
can be distinguished from its twin by indented damage to the outer arc at 5 o’clock), the second 
correctly showing ‘AP 27/1881’. 
Hence 
TYPE L.1. cancel 17.5 x 5.25mm black 

\subsection{TOO LATE FOR BAG}

These ‘TOO LATE FOR BAG’ handstamps, of which five separate types are identifiable, are
invariably used without evidence of any fee and are, therefore, purely indicative. All are of the greatest rarity.

Hamilton records two covers (29 MR 1859 & 23 JY 1860) bearing an unboxed ‘TOO-LATE for
BAG’ handstamp in serifed type which is designated TLFB.1.

Chin Aleong/Proud illustrate (p.242) a boxed instrument for Port of Spain, designated type I 7. In the absence of primary evidence, it is tentatively allocated type TLFB.2. for the purposes of this article. They evidence a single date of use of 16 January 1931.

\ph[99%]{../trinidad/too-late-for-bag.jpg}{Postcard with TOO LATE FOR BAG straight line mark, illustration from Medlicott's article.}

Predictably, San Fernando evidently possessed a companion instrument, illustrated on p.452 and designated type I.6. It is larger than the GPO handstamp, and given a single date of use of 26 November 1930; one partial strike on loose adhesive dated December 1882, believed to be from the same instrument is known to the writer. Without a proving cover to hand, this instrument is tentatively allocated type TLFB.3.

Figure 13 shows a One Penny postal card used from Scarborough, Tobago to Cedar Hall, Antigua dated 15 April 1896, with a bounced strike of an unboxed ‘TOO LATE FOR BAG’. The same instrument is illustrated by Chin Aleong/Proud as I.3. sent out on 27 February 1882, and recorded used in JY 1887.
Hence

TYPE TLFB.4. cancel 49.5 x 3.5mm unboxed black

The fifth and last type, referred to at the beginning of this article, is the instrument used on board the Cedros Steamer, struck on Marriott’s cover (lot 722) of 9 May 1872 in conjunction with cds type O.7. ‘23’. It is also known to the writer on loose adhesive in conjunction with the same cds dated 16 March 1878, and Hamilton records one other cover dated NO 13 1873 to Santa Cruz.

Hence TYPE TLFB.5. cancel 47 x 11.25mm boxed black d. ‘LATE FEE PAID’
Only one ‘LATE FEE PAID’ instrument is known, and is illustrated in figure 14. It is by no means
common, but is more frequently found on cover than any other instrument, and apparently marks a
return to the system of charging a Late Fee for acceptance after normal closure of the mails,
probably in the 1930s. Chin Aleong/Proud list it as Port of Spain I.2.
Hence
TYPE LFP.1. cancel 41.5 x 3.5mm unboxed violet

\section{LATE FEE PAID}
 
Only one ‘LATE FEE PAID’ instrument is known, and is illustrated in figure 14. It is by no means

Hence

\ph[99%]{../trinidad/late-fee-paid.jpg}{Late Fee paid.}

Chin Aleong/Proud show a second, smaller LATE hanstamp used in 1882, designated Port of 
Spain I 4, which yet bears a striking resemblance to the second word in their TOO-LATE type I 3.  In the absence of the primary documents (covers), it is tentatively designated type L.2.
