We next come to the perforated stamps which were first mentioned on
December 22, 1857, when Lord Keate asked for " 50,000 penny stamps, perforated."

A letter was written to the Governor by H. Labouchere, enclosing a letter
from the Colonial Agents, enclosing a letter from Messrs. Perkins and Bacon
relative to the perforation of these stamps.

\begin{blockquote}
69 FLEET STREET, E.C.,

February 5,1858.

SIR,

We beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the ist instant ordering
us to provide 50,000 penny postage stamps for the Government of Trinidad,
which are to be perforated as they are at present used in England, and to be
ready for the mail steamer of the I7th instant. The stamps shall be ready as
required, but we regret to say we cannot perforate them in a manner which
would be satisfactory either to the Government of Trinidad or to ourselves.
When their postage plate was made, the subject of perforating had never been
thought of, and we naturally placed the different stamps upon a sheet as near
each other as was consistent with cutting, but which turned out to be too close
to allow of their being perforated without some injury to almost every stamp,
and even if this was not objected to, they could only be perforated one sheet at a
time and each sheet would lequire twenty-three operations. We could not
therefore do them badly tor less than 35. 6d. per 1000 sheets.

If this operation is much desired by the Government of Trinidad we should
recommend the preparation of a new plate with wider spaces between each of
the stamps, and which we would do for Â£27 5s., being but half the cost of the
original plate, and much below its worth, for we would be glad to meet their
wishes in any way we can ; but even then we should be obliged to charge is. 6d.
per 1oo sheets for perforating, as the new plate would not remove the necessity
of twenty-three operations per sheet, although it would greatly facilitate the speed
and accuracy with which they were done. Few persons understand the machinery
by which the postage stamps used by our Government are perforated, and nothing
but the enormous quantities required would have induced them to undertake
the operation. The machines are enormous in weight, power, and cost; they
require several persons to attend them, including an engineer and steam power
to perform the laborious part of the work, and no machines can be constructed
which work in the manner they do at any reasonable cost.
We are, etc.,

PERKINS, BACON AND Co.,

The Agent general for the Crown Colonies responded with instructions to proceed as per previous supplies:
