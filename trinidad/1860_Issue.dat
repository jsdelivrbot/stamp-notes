\chapter{1860 (Aug)}
(J) The next three consignments belong to the same group, as Governor
Keate wrote on October 5,1859 (received ist November)," for a supply of postage
stamps to be sent out with as little delay as possible, and especially that a portion
at least of the fourpenny stamps may be sent out as soon as they can be struck
off, as those in hand are running very short."

Messrs. Perkins and Bacon received the request op I4th November, and having
2880 fourpenny, lilac, stamps (pin-perf.) on hand despatched them the following
day, and two days later they left England.

As regards the rest of the consignment they said it was utterly impossible to
prepare accurate colours, wet the paper, print and dry, then gum, dry, and
perforate the stamps in the short time mentioned, but the order should receive
immediate attention.

The Governor waited, but no stamps arriving and the shortage becoming
desperate, he wrote again :—

TRINIDAD,

Dated 22 March, 1860.

(Received 12th April, 1860.)

In my letter dated 5 October (I required) a supply of postage stamps to be
sent out with as little delay as possible.

I asked at the same time that a portion of one class of these might be sent
out by the steam packet as soon as (possible) as those in hand were running very
short. This was done, but up to the present time the general requisition has not
been complied with, and we are now entirely without postage stamps of any kind,
except such penny ones as I have fortunately been enabled to have struck off
from an old die. As a six months' supply of stationery . . . has arrived by
sailing vessel, I cannot but fear these stamps have been overlooked, though it
is just possible that they may be among the stationery which has not yet been
landed. No reference, however, is made in the detailed statements received
of the contents of the box. . . . KEATE.

With this letter came a requisition from the Colonial Postmaster, Mr. Leyton,
for 20,000 sixpenny stamps, 15,000 fourpenny, and 100,000 penny, countersigned
by the Governor as before.

This letter gives definite information that the native printed stamps were
again used in March, 1860. Mr. Bacon gives the earliest dated copy as March 12,
1860.

On receipt of the Governor's lettei enquiries were made, and it was discovered
that though " a portion," i.e. fourpenny value, was sent on November lyth, yet
the completion was delayed and the last were not despatched by mail steamer
till April 17, 1860.

(To Colonial Agents.)
LONDON,
69 FLEET STREET, E.C.,
30 April, 1860.
. . . " When you gave the order you desired thestampsto be perforated and
a few to be delivered in three days; this we did and the remainders were printed
at once, but as you desired them to be perforated and there was no machinery
which would do those id. stamps at any rational price they were delayed in the
first instance from the expectation oi completing thejnachines which would
accomplish that purpose, but this machine proving imperfect we directed them
to be perforated by a most laborious way by hand, and sent home, which we fully
believed had been done. . . . We herewith enclose you an estimate for the
supply of id., 4d., and 6d. postage stamps tor Trinidad."
The Colonial Postmaster required 20,000 sixpenny, 15,000 fourpenny, and
100,000 penny stamps.
They were supplied as follows :—
6d. 4d. is.
Sent Nov, 17, 1859 , . — 2,880 lilac —
Sent April 17,"! 1860 . . 18,000 green 9,120 lilac 84,000 red
Sent May 17, 1860 . . 6,000 green | 6,000 lilac 11,000 red
Totals 24,000 18,000 95,000
(K) As Mr. Bacon points out, Messrs. Perkins, Bacon and Co. procured a new
perforating machine in the summer of 1860, and the next consignment of July 5,
1860, sent to the Colony on the 'I7th, consisted of 14,000 sixpe

Messrs. Perkins, Bacon and Co., after expressing apologies and " deepest regret for unreasonable delay," explained the situation as follows :—

sixpenny, 9,000 fourpenny,
and 89,000 penny values which had the clean-cut machine perforation measuring
14 to i6|. |" They have clean-cut holes on all four sides and show that the work
of the machine at the outset of its career -was as perfect as that of the best machines
of the present day."
i8th Consignment.
"May, 1861. 4,080 is., purple. Rough perf.
„ 18,000 6d., green. „
15,120 4d., lilac.
„ 108,020 id., red. „
Mr. William Eversley requested on February 15, 1861:—
is. stamps, £200.
6d. stamps, £450.'
4d. stamps, £250.
id. stamps) £450.
And the Governor forwarded the requisition, " send out with as little
delay as possible," on 20 February, and it was received on 18 March, and Messrs.
Perkins and Bacon had them ready by April 27, and they were probably despatched
by the packet on 2 May.
Mr. Bacon points out that these stamps, like the next and last consignment,
are found " with the rough perforation 14 to 16^ which was made by the same
machine as that used for the supply of July, 1860, and which shows the remarkable
deterioration that so quickly took place in the work of the machine, even
after i t h a d been repaired i n January, 1861."
