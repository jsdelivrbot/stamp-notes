\chapter{First Issue Seated Brittania}

FEW countries have had such a struggle to procure stamps as the
British Colony of Trinidad.

Jamaica when offered the opportunity of possessing stamps
of her own did her utmost to avoid such a calamity, but Trinidad,
though keenly desirous of possessing them, was obliged to wait
over four years for the privilege and was in the quixotic position
of having two consignments sent which she was not permitted to use.

However, the energetic and persistent efforts of the importunate Governor
triumphed in the end, and the Port of Spain Gazette, in its issue of Friday, August
i5th, 1851, writing of the inauguration of the Inland Posts, says, " We sincerely
wish this undertaking which commenced so appropriately on the anniversary of
the birth of its noble originator every success; and trust that the advantage
which cannot but result from it, will again and again recall to the minds of the
inhabitants of this Colony the deep debt of gratitude they owe to Lord Harris
for his unceasing and energetic efforts for the improvement and prosperity of
Trinidad."

Trinidad's philatelic career was inaugurated as follows ;—

I have the honour to acknowledge,the receipt of your letter of May 27 with
Earl Grey's authority for supplying letter stamps for Mauritius on the understanding
they were decidedly different from those in use in this country.

I have been in communication with Messrs. Perkins, Bacon and Fetch, the
contractors with the Post Office, and it appears that the expense of preparing
the dies of a description secure from forgery and engraving the plate upon steel
ready for printing will be seventy-five guineas, and for paper prepared ior the
purpose and printing and gumming ninepence per thousand single stamps\ldots 
and by printing the stamps in different colours, Blue and Red, the same die may
be made to answer both for the local and general postage at the Mauritius.

\closing{I have the honour,}

\closing{G. BAILLIE.}
\end{letter}

To this communication Earl Grey appended a minute on June 28th : " Might
not the same stamp be made to do. for Trinidad ?"

Earl Grey's enquiry was answered in the affirmative.

\begin{letter}
5 CANNON Row,

29 June, 1848.

DEAR BLUNT,

I do not myself see the slightest objection to the use of the letter stamp
die both for Mauritius and Trinidad. I do not know whether the rate of postage
at Trinidad is a uniform rate, in which case it appears to me that it is only to
forward [sic] the number of'stamps-required, and even if it is not I think different
coloured stamps would answer the purpose. . . .

Yours very truly,

G. BAILLIE.
\end{letter}


Earl Grey's minute : " This confirms my opinion it only makes it necessary
to avoid introducing into the stamp the name of the Colony."
Mr. Blunt's minute : " I presume that the stamps should be different colours
in the two colonies."

On July 4 Mr. Taylor wrote :" Lord Grey being of opinion that the same
die may be used for the Mauritius and for Trinidad, I suppose Mr. Baillie should
be so informed and be directed to have £50 worth of penny stamps prepared and
sent out, of a different colour from the Mauritius ones. I have said £50 because
that was the amount applied for in 356 [sic]—-this at 9d. a 1000 would produce
1,333,000. I conclude that half of the expense of the original die (£75) will have
to be paid by Trinidad,"

\end{figure*}

This was confirmed by Lord Grey, and Mr. Baillie informed on July 18th, and
the matter put in hand by Messrs. Perkins and Bacon, who commissioned
Edward Henry Corbould to prepare a water-colour sketch for the use of the
engraver. The essay was later on acquired by King George V and  is now in the Royal collection.

One or more series of colour trials were sent to Mr. Baillie, and on October 4th
he selected two for Trinidad, and suggested 50,000 should be struck off for the
colony, 25,000 in blue and 25,000 in lilac.

\section{First Consignment}

The Perkins Bacon records for the first issue have not been found and the records begin with an invoice dated December 21, 848, addressed to george Baillie, esq., givng details of the charges for making dies and a printing palte of 110 postage labels for Trinidad, and a plate of 216 units for Mauritius.

In the Journal the details are entered as 'for making a second die from the original die of Mauritius & engraving Plate of 110 Postage Labels 'Trinidad' and printing 227 sheets of 110 and 1 sheet of 30, making 25,000 blue labels and a precisely similar number of lilac labels.


\section{Second Consignment}
Percy de Worms obtained a copy of a letter for the second consignment.

The second consignment was invoiced by Bacon on December 4, 1850.

The invoice elicited the following query from Baillie:

\begin{letter}
Mr Baillie requests taht Messrs. perkins & Co. will inform him why only 11,000 Stamps have been sent to Trinidad & also the reason of sending the Blue & Brown Stamps as it would appear that (according to requisition) the Brown was only required.

\closing{Crown Colonies Office}
\closing{20th. December 1850}
\end{letter}


The reply quoted by Percy de Worms in \textit{Perkins Bacon Recods}, Volume I, page 348, proves that the colours of the first and second consignments were alike.

\begin{letter}
Messrs. perkings Bacon and Petch present their compliments to Mr. Baillie, and in reply to his note of yesterdays date, beg to state taht equal proportions of Blue and \textit{Lilac} Stamps sent to Trinidad in consequence of the silence of their order as to colour and the fact that the previous shipment having been in equal proportions of each.

With reference to the quantity forwarded 55 Sheets of each colour were prepared and that number the apcker was directed to enclose in the case, but having misunderstood his instructions, he only put up 50 Sheets of each. When the writer of this note saw the invoice he detected the error, but then it was too late to rectify it. The same cause will account for the fact that the colour is called \textit{brown}  in the invoice instead of \textit{lilac}, the colour which was actually sent both in the first instance, and now to to Trinidad.

P.B. & P. exceedingly regret the circumstance and are prepared to ship the 5 Sheets of each colour which are wanting at their own expense, by the next opportunity if Mr. Baillie should deem it desirable.

\end{letter}

As will appear there was no opportunity for using these stamps for a good
two years. What became of them is never definitely stated, but considering the
small number of the next two consignments, there seems little doubt they were
put by and brought into service when stamps were wanted.



Mr. Bacon is of opinion that during the interval the lilac shade changed to a
grey or brownish grey colour, and gives other similar instances of changelings.
We have .'evidence that this consignment was, as regards the labels themselves,
" not properly prepared " (vide letter 8 March, 1851), which lends additional
colour to Mr. Bacon's suggestion, and the lilac shade was never used again.

The stamps were printed in two colours, as the Governor had always
requested two values, and stress must be laid on the great uncertainty till the
end of 1850 as to the prepayment of the General as well as Inland postage,
A Bill was printed by the Imperial Government on July gth, 1848; for enabling
Colonial Legislatures to establish Inland Posts, but during this period
the wishes of Lord Harris and the G.P.O. had become irreconciliable, though
Lord Grey hopad that as arrangements had been so far made " and the stamps
actually ordered," the Treasury would be able to carry out the new arrangements
as proposed by Lord Harris. ,

But the G.P.O. maintained that if the Imperial Post Office had charge, the
postage rate would be fourpsnce, but if Lord Harris wanted a penny postage
rate he and the Colony must take over the control, and in August Mr. Maturin
arrived with orders from the Postmaster-General to close the accounts of the
Post Office.

Lord Harris was not prepared for this drastic step, and doubting the policy
of acceding to the arrangement wrote for instructions (letter dated September 4,
1848). He complained " that letters coming from England had to be prepaid,
whilst none leaving it could be prepaid . . . but the Island post was becoming
daily a matter of less importance owing to diminished trade."

The G.P.O. explained the situation as follows :—







\begin{letter}

\salutation{GENERAL POST OFFICE,}

\salutation{October 16, 1848.}

\salutation{MY DEAR SIR,}

The Postmaster-General has by his patent the jurisdiction over all Post
Offices in countries where he has established posts, and any posts set up by any
other party than him are there illegal. If, therefore, Lord Harris sets up a post
in Trinidad while the P.M.G. has an office there, he will levy taxes against law,
and all sentences passed for Post Office offences will be illegal. Hence the necessity
of our abdicating if Lord Harris wishes to set up posts in conjunction with
the Postmaster-General. We think Lord Harris' proposal of his Inland Posts
a foolish one and are not willing to take the responsibility of it, but as he thinks
differently and Lord Grey is of opinion that in all practicable cases the colonies
should manage their own post offices we recommend that Lord Harris should
do so. Then comes the question as to who shall pay, and I really see no reason
why the Colony if it takes over the management of the Posts, should not pay
the expense of them. All we should want in this case would be an agent who
would deliver over the bags as they come to the Colonial Post Offices, and make
up the bags going out (though, in point of fact, the Colonial Postmaster ought
just as well to do this as an agent); still there would be duty and we should have
some control. I think we ought to pay a small sum to prevent our authority being
set at nought, as it might be by an unpaid servant. But except for this control,
which we should preserve for the sake of maintaining one uniform Packet System
in the West India Islands, there is no more reason why we should pay the Postmaster
of New York, or of Havannah.

Our proposal is, therefore, simply this, that instead of Lord Harris setting
up posts, as he wishes—to be paid for if they do not cover the expense out of
the Imperial Treasury—he shall take over the Post Office in Trinidad altogether
[sic] and shall levy what rates he pleases, in accordance with the principle adopted
by Lord Grey. That as the present Postmistress is a very old woman and cannot
last above a year or two, it would not be fair to make her the victim of the change
of system, and as we must have an agent for the other islands and the rest of our
Empire, she shall remain as Agent and Island Postmistress as long as she remains,
we [sic] paying her salary, but that at her death we shall be relieved from an
expense from which we get no return, and only pay the worth of the service £50,
and which £50 we should not spend at all unless it was a colony, and we had an
interest in the management being well performed, for if it were a foreign country
we should let it suffer the consequences of its own irregularities.

This is the principle on which we are acting and which seems to me the
reasonable one, as in my opinion it is altogether wrong that Lord Harris, as
Governor, should set up the posts without being responsible for the expenses of
them and having to find the means of paying for them when they fail, as we think
they will do.

AND in this impasse affairs remained from November, 1848, till September,
1849, when Lord Harris, in sending in his estimates, stated that in the previous
year £400 had been voted to carry out the Inland Post Office requirements, and
as nothing had been done he advocated carrying out his own arrangements.

" Though after three years' correspondence it does not appear to me nearer a
satisfactory conclusion, something of the kind is very much called for by the
community and it is a pity that a plan which did not take me half an hour to
arrange—-which I could work efficiently in a month—which would in no way
interfere with the arrangements of the G.P.O., and for which stamps have
already been procured—should not be rendered serviceable."

Lord Grey sent the Governor the gist of the communications he had received
on the subject : " That the Postmaster-General cannot undertake superintendence
and management of the scheme of Inland Posts in Trinidad as suggested by
Lord Harris."

But the P.M.G. has no objection to offer to the authorities instituting and
maintaining in Trinidad their posts at the Colonial expense. That in adoption
of this proposal all control of the P.M.G. over the inland posts would cease ;
but that it would be necessary for the P.M.G. still to maintain an agent at Port
of Spain for the purpose of managing the Packet Correspondence, and that
having such agent the P.M.G. would remain responsible for the delivery of letters
at the Packet Office at Port of Spain and their transmisssion therefrom to other
parts of the world.

6. That with respect to letters addressed to parties in Port of Spain, the
P.M.G. would leave to the Colonial P.M. the delivery of such letters at the residence
of those parties, and it would therefore be for Lord Harris to consider
whether for that purpose a small addition to the packet postage should be charged
to the recipient.

7. That the P.M.G. would assign to his agent at Port of Spain £50 a year by
way of salary, but whether the agent should be a distinct person from the Colonial
Postmaster in Port of Spain or whether the £50 a year should be paid to the
Colonial P.M. as his special remuneration for his Imperial duties the P.M.G.
would leave it for the Governor to determine.

8. That this arrangement, however, as far as the separation of the payments
was concerned, should only take place by the death or resignation of the present
Postmistress—an event which is probably not far distant.* That so long as she
retains her place, the Postmaster-General is content that she should receive her
present salary from the Imperial Funds, although the P.M.G. will decline any
control over her performance of that part of her duties which relates to the transmission
of the inland posts.

At a council meeting on April ist, 1850, Lord Harris said :—
" The several Post Offices will be entirely under the control of the Government,
the central one being at Port of Spain, and others might be established
at Diego Martin, Chaguanas, Conva, Pointe-a-Pierre, Cropouche, La Brea,
Cedros, San Fernando, Savanna Grande, Alley's Creek, St. Juan, St. Joseph,
Arouca and Arima.

The bags for those places on the coast to be despatched by steamer, for those
in the interior in the manner most economical. We may calculate on 100,000
letters and an equal number of newspapers passing through the several Post
Offices in the year. I propose to charge one penny upon every letter received
and delivered unless it should exceed a certain weight . . . and a halfpenny
on every newspaper."

Later (November 20th) Mr. Darling moved an amendment that there should
be one rate of postage, namely, one penny, which amendment was carried.
On April 8th the Council unanimously voted £800 for the establishment of
the Inland Posts, and drew up an ordinance (No. 6 of 1851) for establishing the
same, which was read three times (November, 1850) and sent to England for the
approval of the home authorities.

This ordinance contained thirty-three clauses, but Mr. Bacon gives an epitome
of all that is essential for present-day purposes.* Clause VIII was the only one
that provoked discussion.

With the ordinance a protest was also sent, lodged by Mr. Burnley, describing
inland posts as " a novel experiment for which no general call had been made
by the community! in a public manner."

The home officials had no wish to delay the matter any further and Trinidad
took over control of its Post Office in April, 1851.

The ordinance was passed on April 4, 1851, by five votes to one.
Inland Posts were established on August 14, 1851, and Trinidad crossed the
Rubicon with " its novel experiment " and " foolish idea."

It being necessary to appoint a Colonial Postmaster, Mr. James H. O'Brien,
who had assisted the packet agent (Mrs. Galway) was given the position, for as
Lord Harris remarked, " No one else in the island knew anything at all about
postage stamps." \sidenote{Mr. O'Brien was at the time of the establishment of the P.O. the only person acquainted with the details of the Dept. Letter of Lord Harris of December, 1853.} Post offices were opened at Port of Spain and San Fernando,
but elsewhere the Police Stations served the purpose.
