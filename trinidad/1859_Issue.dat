During the course of 1857 the Trinidad authorities debated the introduction of complulsory prepayment of letters. At the same time they wished that any further stamp supplies be perforated to ease the work of the Post Office. It must be noted at this time Perkins Bacon did not own any perforation machines and any perforations required were carried out at Somerset House, by the Inland Revenue Service. This is an interesting period both fro the stamps of Trinidad as well as other Colonial issues that were going through this transition period.

\begin{letter}
SIR,

I have the honour to request a further supply of postage labels to admit
of the proposed compulsory prepayment of letters from this Colony to the United
Kingdom being carried out. There are no labels now in use but those representing
the value of one penny only, the internal service for which they are intended
not requiring any others ; but it is now becoming necessary that fresh dies or
plates should be prepared representing larger values.

I have to request, therefore, that the Agent-General for the Crown Colonies
may be instructed to have such made and to send out with as little delay as
possible the number of one shilling, sixpenny, and fourpenny stamps stated in
the enclosed requisition, in addition to the fresh supply asked for of one penny
labels.
I have, etc.,

R. W. KEATE.

TRINIDAD, 30th September, 1858.

Required for the service of the Colonial Post Office the following :—

7,000 shilling stamps.

9,000 sixpenny „

4,000 fourpenny „

50,000 penny

ELLYS LEYTON,

Colonial Postmaster.

I certify the within requisition is made for the current supply of an established
and customary service and sanctioned by Her Majesty's Government.

ROBERT W. KEATE.

On October 3rd the Governor wrote saying he had fixed upon ist January,
1859, for the compulsory prepayment on letters,* selecting this late date not only
because it was the day the arrangements would come into complete operation
in England, but also because the Governor did not expect to be provided with a
sufficient quantity of postage labels much before that period.

It was considerably after that period, as he wrote again on Apiil 15, 1859,
saying he was waiting for the postage labels, as the ordinance making prepayment
by stamps compulsory could only be put in force when the stamps arrive, besides
the other regulations for the conduct of the Island Postal Service, since the
duties previously performed by the Imperial Packet Agent (till November 2nd,
1858) had been transferred to the local government.

" Up to this time no intimation of their having been shipped has reached me.
In the meantime, however, prepayment in money has been required and the
new system has been now sufficiently long in operation to judge of the additional
work to the Colonial Postmaster and his need of (extra) assistance."
The stamps (four values as requested) were ready on April I4th and despatched
to the Colony on the 1710, and issued on May gth.

The Governor reported on June 9, 1859, when enclosing the ordinance, that
the labels for which it had waited had been received and advised that all letters
in other Colonies should be prepaid. The matter received prompt attention.
Prepayment of postage was a complete success in Trinidad and there were
very few fines of sixpence.

Mr. Eversley, the Colonial Postmaster, writing in 1862, said: " Scribbling
correspondents who once holding the option of prepayment or not, would crowd
the letter boxes with their effusions, which not being acceptable to recipients
at a charge of one shilling would probably lead to the refusal of a large number
of letters at their destination, thus defeating the collection both of the penalties
and rates of postage, whereas under the present system the number of letters
posted, either wholly unpaid or but partially prepaid, has been so small that it
scarcely occasioned any interruption in the course of the arrangement of mails."
(H) The next consignment bi ought Trinidad its first perforated stamps.
The Governor wrote on May 25, 1859, making enquiries about these stamps
" so as to arrive here in the month of August."

This request was received on 16th June and received immediate attention.
The tender of Messrs. Perkin and Bacon for a supply of four denominations of
stamps for Trinidad was accepted on 11th July, but the firm regretted they would not be ready by the 14th,-as requested, owing to their being " obliged to apply to
the Honourable Commissioners to have them perforated by their machines." *
They were ready on August 4,1859, and despatched to the Colony by the first
mail packet, August l1th : 75,000 1d., red ; 3000 4d., lilac ; 14,000 6d., green ;
3000 is., purple ; perforated pin-perf.
