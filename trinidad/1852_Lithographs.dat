\chapter{The 1852 issue lithographed locally by Charles Petit}

SUPPLIES OF STAMPS printed by Perkins, Bacon for the island of Trinidad ran short on various occasions between 1852 and 1860. The reasons for this are fully dealt with on pages 46 and 47 of the writer's 'Philatelic History of Trinidad to 1862' (British West Indies Study Circle Paper No 3, 1963).

Improvisation was resorted to in order to meet these shortages, and official imitations of the London printed stamps were produced locally. There is a well known Memorandum authorising Charles Petit to print emergency supplies by lithography. Sir Edward Bacon had this document in his possession when he wrote about it on page 156 of The Postage Stamps of the British Colonies in the West Indies published in 1891 by the Philatelic Society, London as our society was then called. Subsequently this most important document could not be traced. Despite all my enquiries, no one could remember ever having seen it until it was recently rediscovered safely filed with some miscellaneous documents in the archives of the Society. Sir Edward Bacon had in fact presented it to the Society in 1910, and it is now illustrated for the first time.

Jas H. O'Brien whose signature appears at the end of the Memorandum was the first Postmaster General of Trinidad. The comment 'Appd' and the note at the foot of the document are initialled by J. Lushington Wildman who was acting Colonial Secretary in Trinidad from 1 September 1852. Prior to this date he had been Private Secretary to the Governor.

The Memorandum does not require further comment except as regards the year it was dated, namely 1851. The earliest recorded use of the lithographed stamps is 25 September 1852, and the note of urgency inferred by the comment that the stamps could be ready by Saturday leads one to suppose that they were required for immediate issue. This ties up well with the dates of known covers except for the year. What is more the Inland Post was only inaugurated on 14 August 1851 and there are plenty of recorded covers for the last few months of the year 1851, all of them bearing London printed stamps.

Also the requisition for Perkins, Bacon stamps which was made in the later months of 1852 was dated 16 August and the supply was invoiced on 30 September 1852, but only despatched by the Mail Steamer Medway on 2 November. The stamps could not have been available for issue before the end of November at the earliest. One is left with the almost inescapable conclusion that the year date of 1851 on the Memorandum was a mistake for 1852, unbelievable as this may seem at first sight for such a document.

At intervals between 1852 and 1860 there were shortages in the island of the Perkins Bacon stamps and a local provisional issue was lithographed to fill the gap. There were five separate issues, the first four being in various shades of blue
and the last (1860) in grey and in red. Covers, multiples and this last (Id) red used are particularly rare. All five issues were printed from the same stone, the deterioration in the impressions being caused by imperfect cleaning of the stone between
printings.
