\chapter{Trinidad}

FEW countries have had such a struggle to procure stamps as the
British Colony of Trinidad.

Jamaica when offered the opportunity of possessing stamps
of her own did her utmost to avoid such a calamity, but Trinidad,
though keenly desirous of possessing them, was obliged to wait
over four years for the privilege and was in the quixotic position
of having two consignments sent which she was not permitted to use.

However, the energetic and persistent efforts of the importunate Governor
triumphed in the end, and the Port of Spain Gazette, in its issue of Friday, August
15th, 1851, writing of the inauguration of the Inland Posts, says, " We sincerely
wish this undertaking which commenced so appropriately on the anniversary of
the birth of its noble originator every success; and trust that the advantage
which cannot but result from it, will again and again recall to the minds of the
inhabitants of this Colony the deep debt of gratitude they owe to Lord Harris
for his unceasing and energetic efforts for the improvement and prosperity of
Trinidad."

Trinidad's philatelic career was inaugurated as follows:—


\begin{letter}
TRINIDAD,

January 30, 1847.

(Received by Colonial Office, March in, 1847.}

MY LORD,

I have been obliged to postpone writing to you on a subject of some
importance to the advancement of civilization in this island, until I received a
copy of the correspondence between Lord Stanley and Sir Henry McLeod.*

That having reached me I now have the honour to propose a plan for establishing
a communication by post to those places which would appear by their locality
most advantageous for this purpose.

I find by the correspondence above mentioned, of .which I enclose a copy,
that a post to San Fernando only was proposed by my predecessor (Sir Henry
McLeod), but I think with great advantage to the public and without much
difficulty an extension might be effected.

I believe that any scheme of this sort must be left to the decision and, if
approved of, entirely under the control of the G.P.O. in London, but I am not
aware whether it is a prescriptive right. (Lord Harris then maintained it would
be preferable to leave it to the Colonial Government.)

I shall therefore, without further comment, lay my plan before your Lordship,
giving first of all a list of places where I would establish Post Offices ;
secondly, I would mention the conveyance I propose to employ to each and the
number of days the post would run, and thirdly, I shall make a statement of the
expenses and a return to be expected.

First. Port of Spain, San Fernando, Savanna Grande, La Brea, Cedros,
St. John's, St. Joseph's, Arouca, Arima.

Second. As a steamer plies between Port of Spain and San Fernando five
days in every week I propose to take advantage of that and also to restrict the
packet to those days. On one of those days it proceeds to La Brea and Cedros,
and once a week may be considered sufficient for those distant points of the
Island at present. A bag would be made up in Port of Spain and San Fernando
to be left with a boat to be employed to carry it to the Conva Post Office ; the
service might be performed by a man on a mule from San Fernando to Savanna
Grande.

From Port of Spain to Arima I would propose the same conveyance, though
I have great hopes a better one may be introduced.
Third. Your Lord will find by Mr. Kains'f circular that he makes a revenue
of \pound395 16s. 8d. from a post to San Fernando alone, making the postage of each
letter one bitt, equal to 10 cents, equal to fivepence sterling. As Mr. Kains
assumes that the Treasury warrant of the nth October, 1843, may be reduced,
I have ventured to propose a still greater reduction in the charge, and though
at the rate of a penny a letter the receipts would not equal the expenses, yet the
total is a small matter compared with the advantage to the Island of such a
measure.

Mrs. Kains calculated at a rate of fifty letters a day to and from San Fernando,
which I think is fair: —

£ s. d.
At 5 days a week at a penny a letter is per annum . . 54 3 4

To Savanna Grande and back I count on 10 letters per
day at 6 days a week at id. . . . . . 13 o o

To Cedros and back 20 letters per week per annum . 4 6 8

To Conva and back 10 letters at 5 days a week . . 10 16 8

To La Brea . . . . . . . . 5 0 0

To Arima and back 20 letters per day . . . 26 o o
£3 6 8

I do not count anything for the cross posts which will be established, viz.
from Conva, San Fernando, Savanna Grande, La Brea, Cedros, Arima, St. John's,
St. Joseph's and Arouca, to each of these places respectively, and I have estimated
the receipts at the lowest possible amount.

I shall now give a statement of expenses : — £ s. d.
As mentioned above, a steamer (the Pared) plies five
days per week from Port of Spain to San Fernando
and back, proceeding on one day to La Brea and
Cedros, and, as it already receives handsome pay
from the Government for every day on which it
plies, no additional charge need be made for the
post bags beyond a present to the captain or mate or
person in charge of them between port and port,

I will put this at . . . . . . . 20 o o
Post Office in Port of Spain . . . . . 50 o o
Post Office in San Fernando . . . . . 20 o o
Post Office in Savanna Grande . . . . . 50 o o
La Brea (and the other six as above £5 each) . . 35 o o
Man and mule to Savanna Grande and back, at 45. 2d.
per day, 313 days ...... 65 4 2
Man and mule to Arima . . . . . . ' 65 4 2
Boat to Conva at 45. 2d. per day, 260 days . • 54 3 4
£314 ii 8

I calculate on a deficit at first of £201 53. od. . . .

\closing{HARRIS.}

\end{letter}

A public meeting was also held on Wednesday, May 12th, 1847, at 12 noon,
at Mr. Maxwell's Hotel at San Fernando, to establish (inter alia) "an inland Post
Office there and the adjoining districts."

The yth resolution passed unanimously was as follows : — 

"That this meeting cannot but express its regret that the inhabitants of this
division should have been so long debarred of the advantages of a Post Office
in San Fernando, and they trust Lord Harris will use his influence to procure for them this boon."

The Port of Spain Gazette * commented : " This resolution is worthy of
prompt attention\ldots There can be no doubt that at a charge of five cents, or twopence
halfpenny per letter, a branch office would more than pay its expenses."
After establishing a Post Office a Bank Agency might be established; but the
former takes precedence because of the present danger of sending cheques by
letter, and we cannot help feeling persuaded that as soon as the security of
postal communication is afforded, the present dangerous and inconvenient mode
of sending large sums in specie by Droghers will cease.

Lord Harris wrote again on June 30, and Lord Grey strongly approved of
Lord Harris' plan and was for giving the local government " full autho
rity to regulate the matter without further reference to this country." f
The Postmaster (Clanricarde G.P.O., April 27, 1847) na(i no objection to the
proposal provided that: —

(1) The Local Post were administered by the Colony.

(2) The Postmaster and Post Office which will be required for the Internal
Posts are separate altogether from the Packet Agency as is the case at Malta
and Gibraltar.

These clauses proved to be the bones of contention, as the Governor does not
appear eager to shoulder the financial deficit, yet, writing on July 3rd, he hoped
"the difficulties to be overcome would not prove insurmountable."

The General Post Office wrote again to the Treasury on September 27, 1847,
that they had no objection provided that " while the Internal Posts are placed
under the management of the local government the whole of the arrangements
connected with the transmission of letters between Port of Spain and other parts
of the world shall continue subject to the control of this Department. . . . The
inland rate of postage to Port of Spain must be paid in advance, the Packet Rate
will continue optional as at present."

The Governor, however, receiving information (Oct. 14th, 1847) of the possibility
of carrying out his proposed intention, took immediate steps with his
Council to formulate regulations for the Inland Posts.

At a Board Meeting held on November 22, 1847, Lord Harris having read
Lord Grey's letter, said : " In case the inland postage should not pay the Colony
must be answerable for the expense. The Post Office authorities do not seem
pleased with the proposition, and after a correspondence with the Postmaster-
General it was proposed the Colony should give up the advantages of sending foreign
letters to England ; but as I knew many in this Colony corresponded with foreign
ports I objected to this. And as I still pressed the point I have succeeded in
obtaining the assistance of Lord Grey; and it is to his exertions we will be
indebted for an Inland Postage\ldots

" There are not above six or seven places where the posts could be established,
namely, St. Juan's, St. Joseph, Arouca, Arima, San Fernando and Savanna
Grande. I propose Mr. Losh and the Treasurer form a Committee and report."J

They reported on December i:—

"The Committee have the honour to recommend :—

1st. That a mail cart for the conveyance of letters, parcels and passengers
be established between Port of Spain, St. Juan's, St. John's, Arouca and Arima.
The said cart to run three days in each week to Arima, calling at the above intermediate
places and returning in the same manner to Port of Spain.

2nd. That letter bags by steamer be made up five days each week for Conva
and San Fernando, and .additional ones every Saturday for La Brea and Cedros.
These bags to be entrusted to a Police Constable who will take charge of the
return bags and remain on board the steamer until her arrival at Port of Spain.
3rd. An inland post from Conva to Pointe-a-Pierre, as likewise from San
Fernando to Alley's Creek and Savanna Grande, to be established five times a
week, returning to Conva and San Fernando on alternate days.

4th. English rates to be adopted and no charge made for newspapers.

5th. All letters to be prepaid, to facilitate which the necessary stamps to be
procured from England with the word " TRINIDAD " encircling the stamp. (Comment
in the margin, " How can this be done ? ")

6th. Contract to be entered into for the conveyance of mails by land, sending
them on shore at Conva, San Fernando, La Brea, and Cedros, and for making up
the bags at the several stations indicated in the Report.

Your Committee consider that the annual excess of expenditure over the
receipts may be at the commencement about £300, an amount which will probably
diminish after the first year, but in carrying out a measure so beneficial to
the public the Committee think this outlay should not weigh against the adoption,
and they are of the opinion that a more frequent intercourse with some of the
places mentioned might hereafter be advantageously established.

J. A. ALLEN, Chairman.

The Governor wrote : " There is every reason for requiring a prepayment of
postage, and which I should have insisted on had it not been suggested. I have
given directions that the Agent-General should be written to, to procure stamps
according to the English form with the word ' TRINIDAD ' added to them, and I
shall be prepared to put the plan into operation as soon as they arrive."
The Agent-General received the demand for " £50 of penny postage stamps
with the word ' TRINIDAD ' stamped thereon, in addition to the Queen's head,"
but it is not surprising to learn that the G.P.O. could not allow such surcharge,
and in addition such stamps would only benefit the revenue of the United Kingdom,
as the Governor was informed.

The Governor replied :—

TRINIDAD,

May 29, 1848.

MY LORD,

. . . Referring to your Lordship's despatch of 16 February it certainly
would have been desirable if the word " TRINIDAD " could have been added to
the stamp, but as that has been found impracticable, I should be obliged if your
Lordship will cause the stamps to be forwarded in such shape as the Commissioner
of Stamps may direct.
(Signed) HARRIS.


" The shape directed " brings us to the stamps of Trinidad. It also brings
us to the field in which Mr. E. D. Bacon has done such excellent pioneer work
and added valuable contributions from time to time, as his researches extended.
The present writer having spent some time in the same field, would wish to
acknowledge the help derived from finding the spade-work so efficiently performed,
and the confidence he derived from finding Mr. Bacon's conjectures when the
path ended in a cul-de-sac in 1891 have been verified by Mr. Bacon and others
(in later times) getting a glimpse over the wall.

So with Mr. Bacon's kind permission, the writer cannot do better than adopt
his list, which corresponds as regards dates of consignment to that in the official
records of Trinidad. As regards the numbers despatched, Mr. Bacon's list is
invaluable as the above records only give the number requested.
As regards the native printed stamps it is somewhat remarkable that they are
never mentioned in the Council Chamber, and I can only find one allusion to
them (q.v.). This adds considerably to the value of the late Mr. M. P. Castle's
researches as published in the London Philatelist.

I therefore content myself with giving particulars of any consignment of
which there is some account, and trust they may be of interest and help
