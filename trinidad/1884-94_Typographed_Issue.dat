\chapter{1884-94 Typographed Issue}

A search of the literature reveals that very little has been written about the surface 
printed stamps of De La Rue, so some thoughts on the subject may not come amiss. 
 
Material for study purposes of this period is very difficult to find, and the scarcity 
of even plate blocks adds to the problems 
 
On the 3rd May 1882 De La Rue informed the Crown Agents that the Perkins 
Bacon plates, that they had been using for the past twenty years, were “so worn as to 
render printing there from exceedingly difficult, and owing to the sheets having to be 
damped it is impossible to perforate them properly”. The printers recommended that 
surface printed stamps be used for the future, and on July 25th of that year they were 
informed that the Colony not only agreed to this but also confirmed the new design 
(Q.V. head) which De La Rue had sent to the Colony via the Crown Agents. 
 
The keyplate for the 1883-1896 issues were one of 120 units and the duty overprint 
plate one of 60. There were six duty plates i.e. ½d., 1d, 2½d, 4d, 6d and 1/-. The first 
consignment was invoiced on 8th December 1882. So much we know from information 
extracted from the De La Rue Archives by John Easton and which was recorded in the 
\textit{London Philatelist}. 
 
As mentioned, the keyplate consisted of a setting of 120 units and this was divided 
into two horizontal panes, each 6 x 10, by a vertical gutter 10mm aide. The Plate 
number is above the second and eleventh cliches in the top row, and below the second 
and eleventh cliches in the bottom row. There were, at different times, two key plates 
used. Plate 1 for all six values, but there was no 4d. value printed from Plate 2. Jubilee 
lines first made their appearance in 1887 i.e. the 50th Anniversary of Q.V. ascension to 
the throne - hence why they were so called “Jubilee”.\index{Jubilee lines|first appearance} 

For the 1883 issue Plate 1 was laid down in 1882 and no alterations would have been required until a new plate was needed in 1892 when the Printers reported that “the key plate had yielded 76,228 impressions and was unfit for further use”. The first supply from Plate 2 was invoiced  in June 1893. It will be seen then that Plate 1 had no Jubilee lines, but for Plate 2 a  single continuous line around each pane was introduced (Figure~\ref{jubileelines}).

It may be of interest here to mention that prior to 1882, the setting had been one of 
240 units arranged in four panes of 60, and the single Crown CA watermarked paper 
was large enough to take the whole of the impression as well as including the words 
“Crown Agents for the Colonies” up the left-hand side of the sheet and down on the 
right, with “Crown Agents” appearing in the gap between the top and lower halves of 
the sheet, all in double lined capitals. The latter lettering is rather larger in size.

The 
1883-1896 keyplate was one of 120 units, and it is evident that the previously used 
watermarked paper was guillotined in two. I have been unable to draw any definite 
conclusion as to whether there were two impressions to the one sheet of paper and then 
cut horizontally in two or whether the paper was guillotined first. The latter would 
seem more logical. This paper was also used for the 1896-1900 issues and I have seen it

for the ½d, 1d and 4d values of 1902-1903. It is likely that it was also used for the 2½d 
and 1/- of 1902-1903. 
The abolition of separate Fee stamps was the main reason for the introduction of 
Postage and Revenue stamps in 1896. The reintroduction of the Britannia design was 
the responsibility of J.A. Bulmer who was then the Postmaster General. The 
arrangement of the key and duty plates was identical to the 1883-1896 issues and I have 
a complete sheet of the 1d. value which proves this. There were seven duty p1ates i.e. 
½d, 1d (round ‘O’ in ‘One’), 2½d, 4d, 5d, 6d and 1/-, and the plates were in use until at 
least 1900. Only the one plate was required during this period. 
 
Towards the end of 1900, so I believe, a new duty plate for the 1d value was 
required. There was a difference however, in that the centre of the ‘O’ in ‘One’ was 
oval vertically whereas in the first die it was round. I assume that the original duty plate 
became defective in some way and it is of some interest to record that I have a marginal 
strip of three stamps, the right hand stamp having the letters of ‘Penny’ out of 
alignment and running towards the bottom of the frame. This strip has Plate 1 under the 
middle stamp and so the defective lettering must occur on the twelfth stamp of the 
bottom row of the right hand pane. Judging from the scarcity of the 1d value (with oval 
‘O’) in unused condition, one could conclude that the difference between the two dies 
was not noticed for some time. 
 
In an effort to provide a better distinction between the various lower values, 
coloured papers were introduced in 1902. The values involved were the ½d grey-green, 
1d black on red paper, 2½d purple and blue on blue, 4d green and buff on buff and 1/- 
black and blue on yellow. The same keyplate No. 1 and its layout which had been used 
for the 1896-1900 issues was utilised for the first printings of the ½d and 1d values and 
is evidenced by Plate 1 examples of these values in my possession, with the single 
continuous jubilee line around each pane. However, in 1902 another plate (no.2) was 
made. I have a sheet consisting of two horizontal panes of the 4d. value which has plate 
2 above the second and eleventh cliches of the top row and with a single broken Jubilee 
line around each pane, the breaks occurring directly above or below the lines of 
perforation. There is an extra central break in this Jubilee line above the sixth cliche in 
the top row and below the sixth and seventh cliches in the bottom row. 

Further, there 
are perforation guides over the sixth cliche in the top row and under the seventh cliche 
in the bottom row. Moreover, the outer rings to the Plate numbers show signs of wear; 
this wear has been observed in varying degrees on other items I have seen. The absence 
of Plate numbers under this bottom row of the above described (half) sheet would lead 
one to assume that the keyplate consisted of a setting of 240 units, divided into four 
panes of 60, each 6 x 10. I am unable to explain the need for a perforation guide on the 
margin separating the upper and lower halves of the sheet; one would have thought that 
one perforation guide at the top of the sheet and one at the bottom would have been 
sufficient. One would also assume that the duty plate for the ½d and 1d value. (Plate 2) 
were also of 240 units, but for the 2½d, 4d and 1/- values, 60 as hitherto, although I 
have no positive evidence that this was so. It is my belief that Plate 1 served for the 
early printing(s) of the ½d and 1d values only, and Plate 2 for the later printing(s) of 
these two together with those of the other three values.

It is interesting to record that stamps from Plate 1 can be distinguished from those 
printed from Plate 2 in that their general appearance is flatter and more dull, and the 
lines of shading in the sky and sea are unbroken, whereas the stamps printed from Plate 
2 are sharper and brighter in appearance and the lines of shading in the sky and sea 
directly above and below where they meet are broken. 
 
In 1904, paper watermarked multiple crown CA was brought into use. This change 
of course, did not affect the plate layout. It is believed that Plate 2 was used for the 
printing of the ½d both grey-green and blue-green, the 1d black on red paper, 2½d 
purple and blue on blue, 6d dull purple and black and 1/- black and blue on yellow. I 
mention the ½d. blue-green because I have a sheet of this overprinted “Official” and 
which has Plate 2 thereon, but it could be that all the printing of this shade with Plate 2 
was used as Officials and none for ordinary purposes. 
 
Following the decision to have universal colours for all colonial issues, in 1905 the 
colour of the 2½d was changed to blue, the 4d to grey and red on yellow paper, the 6d 
to dull and bright purple, and the 1/- to black on green, and a new Plate 3 was 
introduced for these values. The layout of the plate was similar in all respects to Plate 2 
except that the outer line to the plate number is now normal, and the extra central-break 
under the sixth cliche of the bottom row is also now normal. I have evidence in the 
shape of a complete sheet that Plate 3 was also used for a printing or printings of the 
½d blue-green shade. 
 
The 1/- purple and blue on golden yellow paper is something of a mystery to me, 
and since I have not seen a plate number block of this I am unable to say whether it was 
printed from Plate 2 or 3, although I am inclined to believe from Plate 2. 
 
The remaining item in the 1904-1909 issues is the 1d. rose-red which first appeared 
in 1907. It is apparent that an entirely new die was made and the printing done in one 
operation, the lettering of “One Penny” being short and thick, while the point of 
Britannia’s spear breaks the uppermost horizontal line of shading in the background. I 
have a bottom half of a sheet with Plate 1 in the usual position under the second and 
eleventh cliches of the bottom row. However the wide top margin has over each stamp, 
four upright rectangulars with lined shading all in red. Above this wide margin are 
traces of a Jubilee line and this leads me to believe that the plate was one of 240 units 
(4 panes of 60), the upper panes also carrying plate numbers over the second and 
eleventh cliches in the top row. The same broken Jubilee line surrounding each pane is 
in evidence but now there is only the one extra central break under the seventh cliche in 
the bottom row. I have not, as yet, seen the complete Jubilee line over the top row of 
the upper two panes. 
 
This leaves then for consideration the 1909 issue with new designs, which were 
in use until 1913 when the joint Trinidad and Tobago issues came into use. It is 
evident from plate proofs that the 1d value was made up as one single unit with a 
single broken Jubilee line around each pane, whereas the ½d and 2½d values were 
made up of two parts i.e. the frame and the central vignette. I have had no success 
in obtaining or even seeing any sheets or large blocks of these values although I do 
have a right hand pane of the ½d with margins on all four sides, and each stamp 
overprinted “Official”. On this pane appears plate 1 above and below the eleventh 
cliche of the top and bottom rows respectively. There are two broken jubilee lines 
surrounding the pane and the left hand gutter margin also shows the jubilee line of 
the left hand pane. The inner Jubilee line under the seventh cliche of the bottom 
row has the extra break previously mentioned. This leads me to believe that for the 
½d and 2½d values the plate was one of 120 units. I have no evidence as to 
whether the plate for the 1d was one of 120 units or 240 units but Bridger & Kay’s 
catalogue indicates that this plate was also one of 120 units. 
 
The above is intended as a ‘first word’ on the subject; there are quite a number of 
details for which I have given scant information or nothing of all, so should any readers 
be able to throw light on those points I should be pleased to have such knowledge.
