\chapter{Officials}

Probably the most neglected of all the earlier B.W.I. high values is the 5/- rose red 
of Trinidad, S.G.87. There were two printings only of this stamp, in 1868 and 1870, 
and a total of almost exactly 10,000 was issued: but out of these, many must have been 
used for fiscal purposes and destroyed, while a modest number was overprinted for official duty. If not quite in the same class of its St. Vincent counterpart, it does not fall 
far behind the Barbados equivalent for scarcity. Catalogue editors please note!

Incidentally the stamp may sometimes be found with SPECIMEN overprint: the 
type seen is in tiny serified capitals (also to be found on values of the 1883 set) the 
overprint being about 11mm x 1¼ mm, the first ‘S’ a little taller at 1½ mm.

I could not trace any of the correspondence regarding these overprints. In the Sir John Marriot collection there were two essays overpinted "On/H.M.S." and which re-appeared in the market again at Spinks.

On the subject of ‘official’ overprints, how many of us know (it had certainly
escaped me until recently) that postal stationery was also overprinted for official use?
The overprint was on the 1884 1d red Reply card, on both parts of which there is
printed diagonally across the top left corner the legend “ON OFFICIAL SERVICE
ONLY “ in serif-ed capitals 3¼mm high. In the lower left corner a box has been created
by the printing of a horizontal and vertical line, and inside it the words “Signature of
Officer”.

Is it known what quantity of Reply cards was treated in this way and when it was
done? Have genuinely used examples been seen in any quantity? Possibly these cards
had quite a long life, as one of my copies, though otherwise blank, bears traces of a
1914 c.d.s. Incidentally, do issued examples or trials of any other ‘official’ Postal
Stationery exist in Trinidad? Simon Goldblatt
