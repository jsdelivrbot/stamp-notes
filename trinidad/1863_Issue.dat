Early studies have held for many years that the De La Rue first printing arrived during the year 1863, which, but as Mr. Bacon pointed out, would give the above stamps an unusually long lease of life as no provisionals were issued. \sidenote{On January 28, 1862, all dies, rollers and plates of Trinidad were handed to the Agents-general for Crown Colonies, and the next supply was printed by De La Rue & Co.}

Trnidad was the first to order stamps printed by De La Rue from the Perkins, Bacon plates. The rate of 1/1 d per 1000 was exactly the same as that charged by Perkins, Bacon for the last printing, which has been invoiced on January 2, 1862; the printing plates had been handed back to the Crown Agents at the end of the month.

Rev. C. S. Morton\sidenote{\textit{The London Philatelist}, 1911, Vol. XX, p. 10}  endeavoured to solve this question, but found the evidence inconclusive. The Governor wrote on 7 March, 1862, (received 31 March, 1862) as follows : " I have the honour to transmit to your Grace the usual half-yearly requisition for a supply of postage labels." This is endorsed : " At once. This is just in time as some are wanted for the Exhibition."

The plate for the One Penny of 110 multiples was notoriously difficult to perforate because of the uneven alignment of the rows of the stamps. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue had failed to perforate them by machinery, and Perkins, Bacon had used a hand roller with a pin perforation.\sidenote{See \textit{Perkins Bacon Records,} I, pp. 356-67.} From the fact that the catalogue records no less than four different methods of perforating this first order suggests that De La Rue also found it no easy task. They continued however to struggle with this One Penny for twenty years, which says much for the durability of the Perkins, Bacon plates.




 This request is dated 8 October, 1861 and was received on 30 October,
1861, the stamps were ready on 21 December and were shipped on 2 January,
1862. This is the last notice of the shipment of any consignation of stamps,
which is unfortunate as it has been a vexed question how long these stamps
were used before the arrival of the next consignment which were printed by
Messrs. De La Rue and Co. 

Most authorities have held that the De La Rue
first printing arrived during the year 1863, which, as Mr. Bacon pointed out,
would give the above stamps an unusually long lease of life as no provisionals
were issued.

The Governor never mentions the subject of postage stamps again in 1862,
which is unusual if this " half-yearly requisition " did not arrive.
On the 25th January, 1863, he applied for " the usual half-yearly supply of
postage stamps " as if nothing had occurred to interrupt their arrival.
As regards this consignment no details are given, and I wondered if any provision
had been made for the increased postal rates between the United Kingdom
and the Colonies which came into force on April ist, 1863, for if not, the is. value
becoming exhausted, pairs of the 6d. and strips of the 4d. would abound.

I find, however, that the Governor on April 23rd applied for a supplementary
requisition " owing to the increased rate from 6d. to is. the A ounce, having been
determined after the periodical requisition for postage stamps, to be forwarded
in view of the increased demand for is. stamps." The Colonial Agents complied.
I add the next notice as it shows the number of shilling stamps wanted :—


From Bacon's list it will be seen that they were invoiced on
May isth of that year. They were the first lot of Trinidad stamps printed by
Messrs. De La Rue & Co., and the consignment consisted of one penny, four pence,
six pence, and one shilling values, and were, no doubt, the stamps we know on
thick unwatermarked paper, perforated n to 12. The supply was followed on
December 15th 1862 by some more of the one penny, six pence, and
one shilling values, which were also on thick unwatermarked paper, but were
perforated 13. 

Only eighteen sheets (4,320 stamps) of the one shilling value were
sent out in this parcel, which accounts for the rarity of this variety.

\end{marginfigure}

The next lot, invoiced on April 28th, 1863, contained one penny, four pence,
six pence, and one shilling values. Some of these stamps must have been on the
Crown "CC" watermarked paper and perforated 12 1/2, as Mr. R. B. Yardley
possesses an entire envelope with a specimen of the one shilling value of this
variety of watermark and perforation with the three following postmarks on the
envelope :* " Paid at Trinidad "—" Trinidad Jy. 23, 1863 "—" London Au. 14,
63." The four pence and six pence stamps were in all probability on the same
paper as the one shilling value, but the one penny stamps of this and the two
following consignments of April I3th and December gth, 1864, were almost
certainly on the thick unwatermarked paper with the perforation 125. 

This
is proved, I think, by two notices in the philatelic journals of the period now
under review. Dr. Magnus (Dr. A. Legrand) in his paper " Essai sur les Filigranes
et les Papiers employes a la fabrication des Timbres-poste," published in 1865,
states that he knew of the four pence, light violet, the six pence, green, and the
one shilling, mauve, with Crown " C C " watermark, but not the one penny, and
it is only in March, 1866, that M. J. B. Moens records the one penny in brownish
red on the same watermarked paper. 

In England, owing possibly to the fact
that the watermark is sometimes indistinct on the brownish-red specimens, the
variety was not noted until July, 1867. None of the four plates used for the
stamps really fitted the Crown " C C " paper, the watermarks of which were
arranged in four panes of sixty each, in ten horizontal rows of six, two above the
other two, with a wide space between, but the plate of the one penny was even
less suitable than those of the other three values, for when the Crown " C C "
variety was used it entailed a certain amount of waste of paper for each sheet.

It was probably owing to this reason that Messrs. De La Rue & Co. continued to
print the one penny stamps for a time on the thick unwatermarked paper after
they had adopted the Crown "CC" paper for the other three values. The
existence of the one penny value on unwatermarked paper, with the perforation
I2j, was not suspected by philatelists for a number of years, for the variety was
not recorded until as late as 1902.Commencing with the consignment of August
25th, 1865, it was evidently considered best that all the four values should be
printed on the same watermarked paper, notwithstanding that this arrangement
caused a loss of paper by its adoption.

The Crown " C C " paper and the perforation 12\half continued to be used for
the stamps by Messrs. De La Rue & Co. for at least ten years subsequent to 1865,
after which date they employed a single-line perforating machine gauging 14.

This machine was first used for the stamps of Barbados early in 1875, \sidenote{The London Philatelist, 1915, Vol. XXIV, p. 35.} but it is
difficult to fix the exact date when the firm first made use of it for the stamps of
Trinidad, as the alteration of perforation is not recorded in any of the philatelic
journals of the period. Seeing that part of the supply of Barbados stamps sent
out about January, 1875, was still perforated 12\half, I think the change occurred
in the case of Trinidad with the April and September consignments of 1876. 

This view finds support in an able article by Mr. Charles B. Corwin on " The Stamps of
Trinidad," published in 18924 Mr. Corwin states that the earliest dated specimen
he had seen with the 14 perforation was " 1877," and he lists the one penny, six
pence, and one shilling, perforated 14, under that year, and the four pence under
" 1880." Messrs. De La Rue's list shows that no supply of the last value was
sent out between January 22nd, 1875-, and May gth, 1879, so that it seems that
the stamps of the first of those two consignments were perforated 12\half. 

There
were, also, no stamps of the one shilling value forwarded to the island between
September I3th, 1876, and July igth, 1880, so the former of those two lots must
have had the 14 perforation. In further confirmation of this, I may mention that
there are used specimens of the four pence and one shilling values, perforated 14,
in the Royal Collection with postmarks dated, respectively, " Trinidad Sp. 27,
1879 " and " Trinidad Fe. 27, 1877."

On this evidence we may conclude that all the consignments, from April 28th,
1863, to January 22nd, 1875, inclusive, were on the Crown " C C " paper and
perforated I2|, with the exception of the one penny stamps of April 28th, 1863,
April i3th, 1864, ar>d December gth, 1864, which were on unwatermarked paper
but had the same perforation.

Considering the number of years the Crown " C C " stamps, perforated iaj,
were in use, and the quantity printed of them, it is not surprising that a good
many well-marked shades are found of all the four values and that the colours
of two of them—the four pence and one shilling—were changed completely. The
new colours—bluish grey for the four pence and chrome-yellow for the one
shilling—must have occurred in the consignment of July 13th, 1872, as a specimen
of the latter value is recorded with a Trinidad postmark of September gth of that
year,§ and the change of colour of both values is noted in philatelic journals of
the same year.jj All the subsequent supplies of those two values were printed
in the new colours. I do not propose in these notes to deal at all exhaustively
with the shades of colour that exist of the stamps perforated 12 J, beyond giving a
few contemporary records, as it is so difficult to convey to other collectors the
names of shades one adopts for oneself. The first stamps issued were no doubt
those which approach most nearly to the unwatermarked set, perforated 13, and
the one penny, perforated I2|: that is lake for the one penny, emerald-green for
the six pence, and bright deep mauve for the one shilling. The one penny in this
colour is found with the watermark sideways, possibly due to a, trial in order to see
whether more paper could be saved by printing the sheets in this way. The first
colour of the four pence appears to have been violet. In April, 1866, we are told
that the one penny was " less deep in tint " ; the four pence " light violet-lilac " ;
Ihe six pence " grass-green " in place of " emerald-green " ; and the one shilling
" a much lighter mauve " with " mottled groundwork." M. J. 11 Moens, in his
price-list of May, 1867,* gives the colours " pale mauve " for the four pence ;
" deep green," " yellow-green," and " light green " for the six pence ; " mauve "
and " bright violet " for the one shilling. In May, 1868, he says that the one
penny is " carmine," and in December of the same year an English journal J gives
the six pence as " slightly varied in hue," the four pence " a much deeper violet
than any hitherto used for that value," and the one penny " a bright, rather rosyred."
In September, i8yo,§ we are told that the four pence " is now of a very
beautiful blue-violet." 

In addition to the shades given in these references there
are others, as the catalogues of the present day show. The list in Messrs. Stanley
Gibbons' Catalogue is fairly accurate, but I consider that the specimens of the
one shilling, which are called "violet," are more correctly described as " bright
deep mauve," and I do not believe in the existence of the four pence, " grey-lilac,"
or the one shilling, " grey-lilac." I say this because I have never seen a mint copy
of either of these two stamps, and all the specimens I have examined are, in my
opinion, unquestionably colour-changelings.


The one penny, rose, was certainly issued imperforate, a sheet or sheets
having probably escaped the perforation in one of the printings. There is an
unused pair and a used specimen of this variety in the Royal Collection and a
used copy in the Tapling Collection, and both these used specimens have wide
and satisfactory margins. Captain H. O. Weare, who wrote under the initials
" H.O.W.," is one of the pioneers of collecting whose articles nearly always afford
valuable assistance, even after the lapse of fifty years, since they appeared in print.

In an addenda to his paper on " The Stamps of Trinidad," published in 1872,1 he
said : " There exists a (one penny) carmine imperforate on C C and Crown watermarked
paper. I have had one for some time, which I always considered a
genuine imperforate, but was not quite certain until the other day when I was
shown a strip of three, imperforate and postmarked ; which, of course, settled
the question." It will be noticed that Captain Weare terms these imperforate
specimens " carmine." There probably is some " carmine " in the composition
of the colour, but I think that the shade is better described as " rose," in order to
differentiate it from the other colours of the one penny stamps. Imperforate
copies also exist of the one penny, rose, the four pence, violet, and the six pence,
deep blue-green, overprinted " SPECIMEN " in small sans-serif capitals, while the
last value is found unused without the overprint. The perforated four pence,
violet, is known overprinted " CANCELLED " in similar capitals to those used for
the " SPECIMEN " copies.

\section{Perforation 14}

I now turn to the stamps perforated 14, about which there is very little new
to say. As I have already pointed out, the change of perforation from 12\half to 14
almost certainly occurred in the consignments of April and September, 1876, and
all the subsequent supplies of stamps given in Messrs. De La Rue & Co.'s list,
with the exception of the last sent out in 1882, were perforated 14 and had the
Crown " C C " watermark. 

During this period a new value of a halfpenny was
required for use on postcards. The list shows that the first supply of this stamp
was invoiced on May gth, 1879, and the issue probably took place during the
following month, as the stamp is described in the number of the Philatelic Record
of September that year. The stamp was printed in lilac-mauve—called " light
purple " by the printers—from the plate " without expressed value " that was
used for the one penny stamps and the value " HALFPENNY " was overprinted in
black on the stamps in a line of sans-serif capitals above the name of the colony.
Specimens of this halfpenny stamp are found with the watermark in its normal
position, and also sideways. The six pence is known with very clear double
perforation at the top of the stamp, and also with the compound perforation
14 by 12 J. 

A specimen of the latter variety in the Royal Collection bears an early
obliteration with numeral" 6 " in a square surrounded by other lines, which shows
that it was used at Arouca,* a town in the island. The perforation appears to be
genuine, but it is difficult to say for certain whether this is so or not without
examining similar specimens.

The last consignment on the list, which was invoiced on April 25th, 1882,
consisted of halfpenny, one penny, and four pence stamps. These were printed
on paper watermarked Crown " C A " and perforated 14. The one penny of this
issue had the value overprinted in black above the name of the colony in a line
of sans-serif capitals similar to those on the halfpenny stamp.

\section{Five Shillings Value}

\end{marginfigure}

There now only remains to treat of the five shillings value, which was designed
and surface-printed by Messrs. De La Rue & Co. from a plate containing 240
specimens. The special Crown "CC" watermarked paper, which the firm made
use of for large stamps of this size, was employed for the new high value, and the
stamps were perforated 12\half. 



The list shows that fifteen sheets of this value were invoiced on December 15th, 1868, and twenty-six sheets on January 28th, 1870, The stamp was issued on its arrival in the island, as it is recorded in the number of \textit{The Philatelist} of March, 1869. The name given to the colour by the printers is "maroon."

Die proofs are known of it in black and in pink on white enamelled card, and imperforate specimens on the watermarked paper and in the colour of the issue are also met with, but the stamp was not issued in this state for postal use.



The stamps can be found overprinted "CANCELLED" (Figure~\ref{5scancelled}) or "SPECIMEN" either perforated or imperforated (Figure~\ref{5simperforate})  also exist, but there is no guarantee that the former were printed at the same time as the stamps.
