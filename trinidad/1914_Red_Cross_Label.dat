\chapter{Red Cross Label Authorized for Use as a 1/2 d Stamp 18 Sept 1914}


On several occasions I have noticed recorded the discovery 
of some entires bearing the Red Cross Label postmark 
cancelled by later dates than that attributed by the 
catalogue. 

As a guide to the authorised use of this label the following 
extract from the Annual Report of the Postmaster- 
General of Trinidad, and later correspondence will 
contribute to an understanding of this issue.

“I have to record the fact that almost unintentionally there was a provisional issue of 
the local Red Cross Society’s label as a ½d postage stamp on the 18th Sept. last. 

It happened as follows:- His Excellency the Governor, on the 17th Sept. 1914, was 
pleased to grant an application made by the local Red Cross Society, that letters in 
connection with their work should pass through the post free of charge within the 
Colony, bearing the Red Cross Stamp. On the following day about 900 envelopes 
containing Red Cross circulars were presented at the General Post Office by the 
Secretary of the Society for the distribution to country addresses, and were passed by 
my instructions in the ordinary way at ½d rate as the Society was anxious that these 
circulars should be despatched at once. Although the sub offices had not then received 
instructions about them, and in order to avoid their being taxed, as they certainly would 
be in the usual course of business, I directed that the Society’s label should be 
obliterated by the date stamp of the hour and date of posting, and I sent out a circular to 
all the offices informing them of what I had done, and instructing them that all letters 
franked by certain members of the Red Cross committee must be passed postage free in 
future and until further orders, provided that they had the Red Cross label affixed, but 
on no account must this label be obliterated again. Some time afterwards I was 
informed that the labels which had been obliterated on the 18th Sept., 1914, were 
considered by philatelists to constitute a provisional issue of the ½d stamp, and I have 
since heard that the unused Red Cross label is now being sold freely to collectors (a 
fact which affords me considerable satisfaction, as the funds of the Society will benefit 
accordingly), and that specimens of the obliterated label of the 18th Sept., 1914, are in 
great demand, but cannot be easily obtained.” 

A collector and Trinidad resident, Dr. A. Reid, recorded that an extract of a letter 
from the PMG Trinidad to him, dated 17th Feb. 1915, showed:- “Thus the label or 
sealing stamp known as the Red Cross stamp, designed by a member of the Red Cross 
committee and printed locally, was officially authorised for use as a ½d postage stamp 
on Red Cross letters for one day only, 18th Sept., 1914.” 

Dr. Reid said the postmark reads:- G.P.O. PORT OF SPAIN - TRINIDAD 3PM SP 
18, 14, the hour and date of posting. 

If we are to understand the P.M.G. instructions that on no account must this label be 
obliterated again, then it would indicate that those Red Cross labels cancelled other 
than 3PM NP 18, 14, albeit authentic, were not according to the P.M.G. authorised. 
Unfortunately the P.M.G. and Dr. Reid’s extracts do not clarify the item illustrated, 
an on piece Red Cross label (½d) and a ½d postage stamp, making a one penny letter 
rate, both cancelled 3PM SP 18, 14. 

Are we to understand that the letter rate for the 900 Red Cross circulars was one 
penny as shown? It would be interesting to know if other copies of this Red Cross label 
have been found similarly used.
