# 1935 King George V Pictorials

In May 1935, an entirely new series was introduced depicting subjects that were connected in various ways with Cayman Island. 

It is interesting to note taht the \halfd., 2\halfd., 6d. and 1s. values were not placed on sale during the period of currency of the corresponding values of the Silver Jubilee Series. The stamps were printed in sheets of 60 the horizontal stamps being in 12 rows of 5 and the vertical ones in 6 rows of 10. The paper was white in all values. The watermark is Multiple Script CA. perforation 12 1/2.

Printing was carried out by Waterlow & Sons Ltd. Recess.

Artists drawings by Waterlow are in the Royal Collection on white card and handpainted except for the heads. 1/4d., 1/2d. and 1d. in issued colours and designs. 2d in blue and purple. 6d. in deep violet and black and the 5s. in orange-red and carmine, also in carmine brown (Aguilar and saunders, 1962).
