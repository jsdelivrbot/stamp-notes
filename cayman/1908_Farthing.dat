\chapter{The Farthing Stamp}


The reduction of inland mail rates caused the necessity of this 
issue, about the middle of 1908; a notice appeared in the Colonial Office
Journal as follows:—

\begin{quotation}
"Cayman Islands are about to issue  1/4 d. stamps for internal postage in
Grand Cayman."
\end{quotation}

There were three printings. The first supply is said to have been 600
sheets, and placed on sale June 3Oth, 1908, though the enormous number of
orders—one dealer alone ordering 72,000 copies—made it necessary to refuse
supplies to every one. For this purpose the following notice was issued and
sent to applicants :—

\begin{letter}

\opening{GEORGE TOWN POST OFFICE,}

\opening{GRAND CAYMAN, B.W.I.}

No. 27

Notice is hereby given that farthing stamps and farthing post cards
being provided solely for internal postage in the Cayman Islands Dependency,
will only be sold across the counter at a Post Office in the
Cayman Islands.

\closing{By Order,} 

\closing{(Signed) G. A. PARSONS.}

\closing{(Postmistress.)}

\end{letter}

This notice brought considerable ridicule on the Cayman authorities, as
owing to a shortage of halfpenny stamps they were compelled to allow the
farthing stamps to pay postage on the foreign mail, till at last even the whole
of that stock was exhausted, and I have three letters on each of which there
are twelve stamps of this value used. The first printing consisted of a redbrown
ink, and all three printings were perforated 14. There are four
varieties, the most important being No. 19 (1st in 4th row, left pane). A
white flaw shows distinctly on the right of the Crown, obliterating some of the
leaves. The second and fourth flaws are not so prominent, and consist of a
white dot under the "N" of "CAYMAN." The third occurs on stamp No. 76
(4th in 3rd row, right pane), and consists of a hair line running from the top
to the bottom of "A" in "POSTAGE." The stamps were evidently transferred
in blocks of four. Types 1, 3, and 4 have the feet of the letters "MA" of
"CAYMAN " touching, but in Type 2 they are distinctly separated.

The second issue of the farthing stamps was placed on sale November
3rd, 1908, and the printing differed from the first, this one being a medium
brown colour; this was followed by a third printing early in 1909, this latter
colouring being a deep black-brown.
