\chapter{The 1d. and 1/2d. on Five Shillings, 1907}

The reasons which called for the creation of this two provisionals were for all practical purposes identical, teh chief being teh irregular communications between the islands and Jamaica and it is proposed, therefore to deal with these simultaneously. The appearance of the "One Halfpenny" on 1d. already referred to started a demand which in a short while became worldwide. Many collectors became interested in the stamsp of the islands at that time. For fear however, that they might not obtain copies of the provisional through dealers a large number wrote direct to the Post Office at Georgetown ordering supplies, naturally anticipating the "One Halfpenny" on 1d. Dealers also sent substantial orders and it is not surprsing that the issue, of which the face value was only \pound20 (4800 stamps) was soon exhausted.



The 5s. stamp, having been issued primarily for fiscal purposes, was chosen since it was considered desirable that the stock on hand be reduced pending its re-issue aas part of the forethcoming new "POSTAGE & REVENUE" series. The surcharge was carried out by the Postmistress by means of a very crude handstamp composed of a figure "I" and a capital "D" in printer's handstamp.

2201	nhbl	S.G. #19, 19b	imageS.G. #19, 19b, 1907 "1D" on 5/- Salmon and green, inverted surcharge, spectacular top left corner margin plate no. 1 block of four containing the unique inverted surcharge in position 1, together with three normal surcharges, an amazing block possessing stellar features that have all come together in this great Cayman Islands rarity, featuring exceptionally well centered stamps and possessing remarkable freshness with attractive bright colors, in addition all four of the surcharges are exceptionally well struck in the appropriate position, an unusual phenomenon as many surcharges are poorly struck, full o.g. that is lightly hinged in the top margin only, all the stamps, including the error, are never hinged, very fine and exceedingly choice.An apparent shortage of 1p values on November 22, 1907 was the immediate reason for surcharging the 5/- Salmon and green with the "1D" surcharge, followed just a few days later by the "1/2D" surcharge. Despite the scandal that resulted in philatelic circles from the surcharging of stamps, only a few errors characteristic of overprints being applied by hand occurred and they all seem to be honest mistakes. In the case of the inverted overprint this single known example testifies that this was not being done to create varieties. Furthermore, by being preserved in a block of four it provides further evidence of this fact. The stamp that received the inverted impression is the first stamp on the left pane. Undoubtedly this was the first stamp to be handstamped on the sheet. Apparently the clerk had picked up the handstamp in the wrong position and applied this first impression. When he saw the error he shifted the handstamp and applied the rest correctly.A marvelous rarity of the Georgetown provisionals and of all Cayman Islands philately. Not only is this the only inverted error in a block of four but, in fact, there are no other inverted surcharges of this value recorded. This unique Inverted "1D" Surcharge on the 1907 Five Shilling is the premier rarity of the Cayman Islands, and of the entire British Commonwealth.

Almost immediately it was discovered that the supply of 1/2d stamps, despite the earlier issue would not last more than a day or two and consequently it was essential to replenish the stock without any delay. The necessary instructions were accordingly given to Miss Parsons to surcharge 15 sheets of the same 5s denomination (1800) stamps with "\half D" the "I" and the "D" being identical to those used earlier. It is noteworthy that no fraction bar was included. The supply of this value was placed on sale on November 26th 1907---three days after the 1d. on 5s.---and proved adequate to meet the demands until supplies of the new series came to hand.

The surcharge varies from vertical to diagonal and is ususally found with the figure "2" falling on the original 5s. value, but like its contemporary, many copies exist with it in other positions. A few examples are known with it printed right over the King's Head with the figure "I" nearly touching the top of the stamp. Occassionally the figures "1" or "2" or the letter "D" (or the greater part of it) is missing no doubt due to the difficulty in delivering an absolute vertical stroke with the handstamp.
