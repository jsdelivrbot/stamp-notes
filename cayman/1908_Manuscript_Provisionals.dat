\chapter{1908 Manuscript Provisionals}

At he beginning of May, 1908 the tock of the 1/2 d. and 1d. stamps was completely exhausted and strict instructions were issued that mail which called for either denominations was to be handled with the necessary cash across the Post Office counter to be marked by the Postmistress---Miss G. A. Parsons---to the effect that postage has been paid, initialled by her and handstamped.

2247	c	S.G. #MP1a	imageS.G. #MP1a, "(Postage Paid/G.A.P.) 1/2" 1908 manuscript provisional in red ink on cover to Cayman Brac, with clear "George Town/Grand Cayman/MY 23 08" c.d.s., Type 4 pmk., vertical fold and back flap missing; still a very fine example of this rare provisional; because of the "scandal" that occurred over provisionally surcharging stamps to meet the shortages of low value stamps surcharging was forbidden, as a consequence the only way that mail could be posted for domestic and Empire letter rates when there were no 1/2p or 1p stamps was to accept the payment in cash and endorse the cover that it was paid, originally "Postage Paid" and the initials of the postmistress were all that was used, however in the last two weeks of May an additional rate of "1/2" or "1" was added in the same manuscript to indicate the amount paid since payment was being excepted for both values, all of these first provisionals in May are rare, but the ones with value notation are particularly so, the cover offered here is one of only two such domestic covers recorded with the additional "1/2" notation; an important provisional rarity that rounds out the picture of the provisional measures used in the Cayman Islands; ex-Byl, Green.

2248	c	S.G. #MP1a	imageS.G. #MP1a, "(Postage Paid/G.A.P.) 1" 1908 manuscript provisional in red ink on cover to England for payment of the 1p Empire letter rate, with clear "George Town/Grand Cayman/MY 23 08" c.d.s., Type 4 pmk., Kingston transit on the reverse and backstamped Cheltenham, remarkably fresh and intact cover for this rare provisional, very fine; the use of this provisional measure could certainly be used for domestic mail, U.P.U. regulations probably prohibited it for foreign mail, but within the British Empire it was accepted, Stanley Gibbons does not distinguish between the covers with different added value notations but both are incredibly rare, like the "1/2" provisional we are aware of only one other cover with the additional "1" notation, which was offered in the 1995 Robert J. Cooley Sale of Shreves Philatelic Galleries, that cover paid the same rate to Jamaica and this rate was not known to Stanley Gibbons at that time, the cover offered here is the finer of the two and a wonderful companion to the "1/2" provisional of the same date in the previous lot; 1969 BPA certificate; ex-Green.

2252	c	S.G. #MP5	imageS.G. #MP5, "Paid 1/4/G.A.P./asst" 1908 manuscript provisional in red ink on locally run unsealed printed matter rate cover, with an exceptionally full and clear strike of a "George Town/Grand Cayman/OC 15 08" c.d.s., Type 4 pmk., vertical fold to cover but in all other respects very fine; the controversy over the surcharged provisionals in British stamp circles led to an official inquiry that resulted not only in the prohibition of provisional overprints necessitating the use of manuscript endorsements, but it also led to the replacement of long time postmistress Gwendolyn Parsons by William Graham McCausland, this occurred between the time when she was endorsing letters in May due to the lack of 1/2p and 1p stamps and October when there was a shortage of 1/4p stamps, virtually all the October paid markings were done by McCausland, however Parsons was allowed to stay on in the post office as an assistant and this very rare marking bears testimony to that turn of events; one of only three recorded covers and a key rarity to complete an exhibition of the Cayman Islands provisionals; ex-Byl, Green.  £6,500  SOLD for $14,000.00}
