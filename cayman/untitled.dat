COLLECTORS OF THE STAMPS and postal history of this small colony must be aware that it is less popular
than most of its West Indian neighbours. There are two main reasons commonly put forward for this relative
unpopularity. The first is that there was only a single issue in the Queen Victoria Key Plate design in 1900-01; the
second is that the so-called 'Cayman Islands Scandal' of 1907-08 resulted in such a bad press over the years that
many collectors were led to believe that the Surcharges and Provisionals were issued for the use of dealers, rather
than for legitimate postal purposes.

The occasion of my display to the Society was a useful opportunity to present extracts from Colonial Office files
and other authorities which rebut these criticisms, and which I now summarise:

As regards the late issue of the first Queen Victoria stamps, it is necessary to bear in mind that the Cayman
Islands was a Dependency of Jamaica under the British Constitution until 1962, when Jamaica chose independence
and the Cayman Islands became a Crown Colony.

I quote from a letter of 21 May 1848 written by Richard Pheelen, JP, and supported by 170 other Cayman
inhabitants. This letter, in the form of a Petition or Memorial, was addressed to Earl Grey of the Colonial Office
and pleaded - inter alia:

'I have the honour to lay before your Lordship a Memorial with numerous signatures from the inhabitants of the Grand
Cayman Island, the object of which is to obtain some modification of the arrangements of the Royal Mail Steam Packet service
by which they may be brought within the routes so as to have periodical opportunities of using the Packets for the purposes of
passage and Postal service.'

The pressure for the Island to obtain its own postal service was maintained but there seems no doubt that the Jamaican Legislature did little to help. Much evidence is available to support this view, but as an example I choose a letter dated 9 February 1854 written by Sir Humphrey Berkeley to the Duke of Newcastle under this
Heading: 'APPLICATION BY CAYMAN ISLANDS FOR POSTAL FACILITIES 1854. and APPLICATION
FOR RESIDENT MAGISTRATE'. This Letter stated - inter alia:



'My Lord Duke, I have the honour to transmit the copy of an Address from the inhabitants of the Government of Grand
Cayman - asking for certain alterations in the political institutions, and for the concession of postal communications by the
Royal Mail steamers now plying between Jamaica and Honduras.'
Later in this letter, in para 3, the writer states:
'I am bound to add, from all I can learn, that the inhabitants of the Islands have substantial cause for complaint in the utter
disregard of their interest, and even of their existence, which has ever been exhibited by the Jamaican Legislature.'

The first concession to continued pressure over a period of nearly 50 years for Cayman Island to have its own
postage stamps was the agreement of the Jamaican Legislature that facilities could be provided for a Post Office
at Georgetown, Grand Cayman and Stake Bay, Cayman Brae but these were clearly only Branch Offices of the

Jamaica PO. Examples of the use of Jamaican stamps postmarked in the Cayman Islands are shown in Figures 1
and 2: Jamaican stamps were supplied to the Islands on or before 13 April 1889, on which date Jamaica's
Postmaster announced the supply: letters prepaid in the Cayman Islands would be treated as though they had
originated in Jamaica.
The long awaited issue of its own stamps by the Crown Agents for the Dependency of Cayman Islands followed
a last attempt by the Jamaican PO requesting the Crown Agents to use the Jamaica Key Plate with the words
'Cayman Islands' overprinted over the Jamaican stamps. This suggestion was not accepted by the Crown Agents,
as confirmed by this extract from a letter of 29 May 1900 sent to the Colonial Secretary's Office, Kingston,
Jamaica, stating, inter alia:

'It is not possible to utilise the Jamaica Plates in the way you suggest and we have therefore, with the approval of the Secretary
of State, instructed Messrs De La Rue and Co to print them from the Universal Key Plate which will only involve the cost of Â£12
for an overprint plate for each of the duties required etc. The stamps will be ready for shipment in about ten weeks time.'

Signed. E. E. Blake for Crown Agents.

One hopes that these few facts will help to explain why the First Issue of CAYMAN ISLANDS stamps was so long delayed, and certainly through no fault of the Dependency's officials.
There were two values of the First Issue - d and Id, which became available on 19 February 1901, printed from the General Colonial Key Plate by De La Rue and Co. Essays of both values were included in the display and are reproduced in Figure 3.
