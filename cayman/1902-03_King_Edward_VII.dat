2055	E	S.G. #5E-7E	S.G. #5E-7E, 1902 Composite value tablet essay from the De La Rue archives, hand painted value tablets for the 2 1/2p, 6p and 1/- values on tracing paper, measuring 50x46mm, mounted on small piece of the archival page, titled "Cayman Islands" and dated "July 25, 1901", very fine; includes extract that relates that the request from Jamaica for addition values came in and these value tablets were approved on the above date for use with the current Victoria design, however on November 29th the color scheme was approved using the new universal key plate of King Edward VII, which is how they were eventually issued; a unique hand painted essay that bridges these two issues; ex-Green (Scott #5E-7E).   	 Est. 1,000-1,500.}

2060	TC	S.G. #3TC, 7TC	S.G. #3TC, 7TC, 1902 1/2p Blue, 1/2P Brown and 1/- Orange imperforate trial color proofs, on gummed watermarked paper and affixed to portion of De La Rue archival Appendix sheet, inscribed at the top "29th Novr. 1901/Cayman Islands/Req.51/1901", approved and initialed in pencil at bottom, proofs are all exceptionally well margined ranging from large to extra large, very fine; this is the approval sheet for the three additional values requested by Jamaica for the Cayman Islands, blue was assigned to the 2 1/2p in keeping with U.P.U. specifications, brown for the 6p and orange for the 1/-, this last is the actual color and design as issued, also this orange was evidently developed specifically for that value of Cayman Islands as it is designated that way in the Ink Recipe Book; in addition these color selections are bit unusual on the 6p and 1/- as it was standard practice, for security reasons, to print colonial stamps above 2 1/2p in value as bi-colored; an extraordinarily handsome archival piece of the greatest rarity (Scott #3TC, 7TC).    Est. 2,000-3,000
