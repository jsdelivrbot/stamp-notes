\chapter{1902-3 King Edward VII}  

Almost as soon as the Queen Victoria series were issued a demand arose for denominations higher than the 1d.; accordingly an aorder was placed on July 11th, 1901 for a supply of 2 1.2d., 6d., and 1/- values. Owing to the death of Queen Victoria on January 22nd 1901  a small profile of King Edward VII was naturally substituted.

The design was substantially identical to the one for the Queen victoria issue with the only significant change in the fact that the King's head is displayed on a solid background instead of a lined background and the circle in which it is contained is broken at the top to allow for the introduction of a miniature crown. Furthermore whilst the duty plate for teh 2 1/2d. and 6d. was the same with teh values in white on alined background taht of teh 1/- value has teh figure in colour on an uncoloured background.


\section{Die Proofs}

Die proofs of the head only in various states of black on glazed card have survived as well.

2055	E	S.G. #5E-7E	S.G. #5E-7E, 1902 Composite value tablet essay from the De La Rue archives, hand painted value tablets for the 2 1/2p, 6p and 1/- values on tracing paper, measuring 50x46mm, mounted on small piece of the archival page, titled "Cayman Islands" and dated "July 25, 1901", very fine; includes extract that relates that the request from Jamaica for addition values came in and these value tablets were approved on the above date for use with the current Victoria design, however on November 29th the color scheme was approved using the new universal key plate of King Edward VII, which is how they were eventually issued; a unique hand painted essay that bridges these two issues; ex-Green (Scott #5E-7E).   	 Est. 1,000-1,500.} 

The first consignement comprised---2 1/2d. (9600) 6d. (2000) and 1/- (9100) and was shipped by the S.S. Elbe on December 24th, 1901 arriving in jamaica on january 24th, 1902 and placed on sale in georgetown some days later. 

Further supplies were cabled for from jamaica on march 14th 1902 and teh following quantities were shipped by the S.S. Atrato--- 2 1/2d. (3960), 6d. (3000) and 1/- (1000). Although some evidence exists taht still further supplies were ordered on May 10th and November 10th, 1902 respectively no record can be traced of their extent or of teh date of their receipt in the islands. 

Due to the fact that large stocks of the Queen's series were held at the time the issue of these denominations bearing the King's head was delayed.
