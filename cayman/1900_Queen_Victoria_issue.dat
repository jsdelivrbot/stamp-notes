2042	P	S.G. #1P	S.G. #1P, 1900 Queen Victoria master key-plate die proof, with blank country name and value tablet, but this example is specifically identified with the Cayman Islands with pencil notation "Cayman Islands" at top and listing 2 1/2p, 6p and 1/- values with design notations, in black on glazed card measuring 92x60mm, very fine; this proof was annotated at the time a request was made for these three additional values to accompany the 1/2p and 1p that had already been issued, all were to be the same Queen Victoria design, but because Edward VII had assumed the throne while this was being contemplated it was decided to wait for the new Edward VII designs to issue these new values; an important proof in the production of Cayman Islands stamps being unique thus; ex-Green (Scott #1P).   	 Est. 1,000-1,500
