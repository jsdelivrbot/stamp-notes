# 1900 Queen Victoria Issue

Many formalities were necessary before the issue of the first Cayman Island stamps, the chief being the approval of the jamaican Assembly and the Justices and Vesrty of the Cayman Islands.

It is recorded that a requisition was sent to the Crown Agents on April 27th 1900 who, with the approval of the Secretary of State, instructed Thomas De La Rue and Co. to print the stamps from their Universal key plate also known as the General Colonial key late.

The design consists of a rectangle 22 1/2 by 18.5 mm having in the centre a circle within a square embidying a small portrait of Queen Victoria with the word "POSTAGE" on either side in a narrow vertical tablet. The stamps were surface printed in sheets of 120 arranged in two panes 60 side by side. The name and denominations appear in tablets at the top and bottom respectively and were inserted a a second operation from what is known as "duty plate" and bieng comprised of sixty impressions had to be applied twice to the sheets of stamps.

By the adoption of this process only the initial cost of the duty plate for each of the values (1/2d and 1d.) was involved. These were approved on May 23rd, 1900 and a first supply, said to comprise 405 sheets and 750 specimens of each value, was shipped by the S.S. Elbe on august 7th, 1900.

The receipt of teh stamps was acknowledged on November 20th, 1900. there is no doubt taht some were placed on sale sometime before February 19th, 1901, the official date of issue, since used copies daed january, 1901 are in existence. The Stamps are discussed in the [1900 Queen Victoria Issued Stamps](../cayman/1900_Queen_Victoria_issue_stamps) part of this article.

## Archival Material

The disposal of the De La Rue archives provided numerous samples of die and plate proofs, colour proofs and the like. 


To get the approval of the authorities, De La Rue would normally produce essays. These were hand painted and were sent for approval.  Three sets are believed to been produced, one each for the Crown Agents, the Cayman Islands Authorities and the De la Rue archive. The Maisel collection unusually had all three copies, which we illustrate. The scans do not do justice to these miniature works of art.
