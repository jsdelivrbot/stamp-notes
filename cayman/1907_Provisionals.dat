\section{The Surcharge Provisionals 1907}

In May, 1907 it was discovered that, following the fulfilment of some substantial orders from abroad, teh stock of the \half d stamps had been reduced to seventeen sheets (2040) stamps. This was estimated taht it would not last for more than two months. As it would not have been possible to obtain a fresh supply of stamps on time there remained no alternative but to resort to the method of surcharging some other value. Accordingly on June 11th, 1907 the Commissioner of the Cayman Islands, the Hon. G.S.S. Hirst wrote to the Colonial Secretary of Jamaica and requested permission for the overprinting of the stamps:

\begin{letter}

I have the honour to report that a large foreign order has reduced my stock of 1/2d. (half penny) stamps to 17 (seventeen) sheets, which at the ordinary rate of sales will not last me eight weeks. I am therefore forewarding 40 shets of penny stamps of which I have a good stock, with a request that they may be surcharged \half d. and returned to me as soon as possible.

I shall in the course of a few months, if sales continue as they are at present, be getting short of other denominations to His Excellency."

\end{letter}

The Governor was not pleased and a stern reply was sent via the Colonial Secretary, who  wrote as follows:


\begin{letter}

Colonial Secretary's Office

26th July, 1907

Copy 7223-8212/07

Sir,

I am directed by the Governor to acknowledge receipt of you letter, No. 143, of the 11th ult. explaining that a large foreign order had reduced teh stock of \half d stamps to seventeen sheets, and forwarding forty sheets of penny stamps with the request that they may be surcharged \half d.

2. In reply I transmit herewith a copy of the Secretary of State's circular dispatch of the 8th August 1894, on the subject of surcharge of postage stamps, and to request you to be so good in future as to refuse to supply the speculative demands of dealers until you have a good stock. Copies of the Secretary of State's circulars of 27th September, 1896 and 19th September, 1905 are also enclosed for your information and guidance.

3. As the surcharge in thsi case may be regarded as necessary for teh convenience of the public, teh Superintentent of the Government Printing Office has been instructed to surcharge the stamps as requested; and I am to request tht you will not sell any of these surcharged stamps except across the counter.

4. In conclusion, I am to add that the Governor is not prepared without substantial reason, to authorise a new issue of stamps, and to request you to report on this question as soon as possible. I am to say that if a fresh supply of halfpenny or other stamps is required, a requisition should be sent forward in due time to enable them to be obtained from the Crown Agents before the stock in hand is exhausted.

The forty sheets (4800 stamps) of the current King Edward VII 1d. carmine (SG 9) were duly surcharged at the Goverment Printing Office, Jamaica, with the words "One Halfpenny" in two lines of print, the lower case with capital initials in black---the words ``One'' and ``Halfpenny'' measuring 5.25 and 13.5mm respectively. 

Although the printingg was carried out with the utmost care occasionally the full stop after "Halfpenny" and sometimes the `y' do not appear and are found on the adjoining stamp due to the surcharge being off centre. The dented variety found on the stamps of this issue is particularly elusive as only 40 stamps were printed. The variety is exceedingly rare used with possibly only three copies having survived.
