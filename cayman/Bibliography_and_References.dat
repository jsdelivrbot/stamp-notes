The Richard Maisel (FRPSL) Collection - February 24, 2007
Richard Maisel's Cayman Islands is the epitome of what an International Large Gold Medal winning collection should be. Everything presented in his collection is represented by premium pieces and virtually nothing important is missing. Without question, it is the finest collection of Cayman Islands ever formed.

The Maisel collection begins with an extraordinary offering of Jamaican stamps used in the Cayman Islands - both on and off cover. And the collection continues with a wonderful range of all the different components for each Caymans issue, starting with essays and proofs. The stamps are represented by excellent mint and used singles and multiples, along with all of the highly collectible varieties and errors for each issue - a number of which are among the greatest rarities in British philately. His postal history is not only rare, but often times it is the best that is available.

Shreves has honored Mr. Maisel's collecting achievement by producing a handbook style all-color auction catalogue - which will become a collector's item itself. Catalogs may be purchased for $25 U.S. (AUD35 Australia or \pound13 United Kingdom). 

The catalog will also include a CD which contains complete scans of his award-winning exhibition pages - provided at no additional charge.
