\chapter{King George V, First Series 1912-20}

The death of King Edward VII on May 10th, 1910 rendered necessary a new series of stamps in all instances where the reproduction of his head formed part of the design. The Colonial Office Journal of October 1911 recorded that:

\begin{letter}

"Since our last issue H.M. the KIng has signified his approval of the use, for stamps to be issued by the Crown Colonies and Protectorates, of the portrait adopted by the Indian Government, but without the mantle, and with the crown raised above the haed as in the stamps bearing teh portrait of the late King. The borders of the stamps printed from teh general key-plate will probably be entirely altered. The engraving of the necessary dies has been put in hand by Messrs. de La Rue \& Company, but there is little hope that any of the new stamps will appear before March or April next\ldots"


\end{letter}


In accordance with the forecast the first denominations were issued on April 24th, 1912 as evidenced by the following notice which appeared at the Georgetown Post Office:

\begin{letter}

No. 2/1912
