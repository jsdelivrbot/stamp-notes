Walter, Inspector of Police, "Georgetown/Grand Cayman/MR 11 10" c.d.s. receiving pmk., Type 5, cover with slight edge wear and stamps affixed slightly over the edge nibbing a few perfs., very fine; this is the first type of rural collection marking used on the route from Boddentown to Georgetown, in itself it is a rare marking with only 31 covers recorded, but this cover is especially desirable being a commercial usage, plus being the earliest recorded usage on the one farthing value, which was issued especially for this rural domestic service, requiring two in this case to pay the new 1/2p domestic letter rate; ex-Cooley (Scot #31).

Jessica Laturn/East End" at top left, probably put on by the postman who would have known who originally sent it, light cover creases, otherwise very fine; an extremely rare and one of the most interesting and unusual foreign mail usages of this marking paying the 1p Empire letter rate, it pre-dates the October 16, 1912 date listed for this value by Giraldi and McCann, but this maybe should be 1911 since that work illustrates this cover; 1992 RPS certificate; ex-Rohloff, Marston and Prappas (Scott #22).

H. Bodden & Co. in Georgetown, extremely rare as there are only two or three examples of this card used from East End on the rural route. (Image)	Est. 1,000-1,500

H. Bodden & Co. with the message "Please send me by Henry one bbl 'Meriam' flour, Yrs. J. T. Ebanks", this is the only date recorded for this postal card with this incredibly rare West Bay rural post marking; a fabulous rural post and postal stationery rarity. (Image)	Est. 2,000-3,000
