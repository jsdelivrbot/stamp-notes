## Cayman Islands - Background

COLLECTORS OF THE STAMPS and postal history of this small colony must be aware that it is less popular
than most of its West Indian neighbours. There are two main reasons commonly put forward for this relative
unpopularity. The first is that there was only a single issue in the Queen Victoria Key Plate design in 1900-01; the
second is that the so-called 'Cayman Islands Scandal' of 1907-08 resulted in such a bad press over the years that
many collectors were led to believe that the Surcharges and Provisionals were issued for the use of dealers, rather
than for legitimate postal purposes.

The occasion of my display to the Society was a useful opportunity to present extracts from Colonial Office files
and other authorities which rebut these criticisms, and which I now summarise:

As regards the late issue of the first Queen Victoria stamps, it is necessary to bear in mind that the Cayman
Islands was a Dependency of Jamaica under the British Constitution until 1962, when Jamaica chose independence
and the Cayman Islands became a Crown Colony.

I quote from a letter of 21 May 1848 written by Richard Pheelen, JP, and supported by 170 other Cayman
inhabitants. This letter, in the form of a Petition or Memorial, was addressed to Earl Grey of the Colonial Office
and pleaded - inter alia:

'I have the honour to lay before your Lordship a Memorial with numerous signatures from the inhabitants of the Grand
Cayman Island, the object of which is to obtain some modification of the arrangements of the Royal Mail Steam Packet service
by which they may be brought within the routes so as to have periodical opportunities of using the Packets for the purposes of
passage and Postal service.'

The pressure for the Island to obtain its own postal service was maintained but there seems no doubt that the Jamaican Legislature did little to help. Much evidence is available to support this view, but as an example I choose a letter dated 9 February 1854 written by Sir Humphrey Berkeley to the Duke of Newcastle under this
Heading: 'APPLICATION BY CAYMAN ISLANDS FOR POSTAL FACILITIES 1854. and APPLICATION
FOR RESIDENT MAGISTRATE'. This Letter stated - inter alia:

\begin{blockquote}

'My Lord Duke, I have the honour to transmit the copy of an Address from the inhabitants of the Government of Grand
Cayman - asking for certain alterations in the political institutions, and for the concession of postal communications by the
Royal Mail steamers now plying between Jamaica and Honduras.'
Later in this letter, in para 3, the writer states:
'I am bound to add, from all I can learn, that the inhabitants of the Islands have substantial cause for complaint in the utter
disregard of their interest, and even of their existence, which has ever been exhibited by the Jamaican Legislature.'

\end{blockquote}

\ph[98%]{../cayman/map.jpg}{ }

The first concession to continued pressure over a period of nearly 50 years for Cayman Island to have its own
postage stamps was the agreement of the Jamaican Legislature that facilities could be provided for a Post Office
at Georgetown, Grand Cayman and Stake Bay, Cayman Brae but these were clearly only Branch Offices of the
Jamaica PO. Examples of the use of Jamaican stamps postmarked in the Cayman Islands are shown in Figures 1
and 2: Jamaican stamps were supplied to the Islands on or before 13 April 1889, on which date Jamaica's
Postmaster announced the supply: letters prepaid in the Cayman Islands would be treated as though they had
originated in Jamaica.
The long awaited issue of its own stamps by the Crown Agents for the Dependency of Cayman Islands followed
a last attempt by the Jamaican PO requesting the Crown Agents to use the Jamaica Key Plate with the words
'Cayman Islands' overprinted over the Jamaican stamps. This suggestion was not accepted by the Crown Agents,
as confirmed by this extract from a letter of 29 May 1900 sent to the Colonial Secretary's Office, Kingston,
Jamaica, stating, inter alia:

'It is not possible to utilise the Jamaica Plates in the way you suggest and we have therefore, with the approval of the Secretary
of State, instructed Messrs De La Rue and Co to print them from the Universal Key Plate which will only involve the cost of £12
for an overprint plate for each of the duties required etc. The stamps will be ready for shipment in about ten weeks time.'

Signed. E. E. Blake for Crown Agents.

One hopes that these few facts will help to explain why the First Issue of CAYMAN ISLANDS stamps was so long delayed, and certainly through no fault of the Dependency's officials.
There were two values of the First Issue - !/:d and Id, which became available on 19 February 1901, printed from the General Colonial Key Plate by De La Rue & Co. Essays of both values were included in the display and are reproduced in Figure 3.


The death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, together with an earlier request for higher values than the '/id
and Id, led to the substitution of the King Edward VII POSTAGE-POSTAGE Key Plate Issue, the 2'/2d, 6d and \lvalues
being on sale in January 1902, the 'Ad Green in September 1902 and the Id Carmine in March 1903. 

It is
believed that this Issue was the first to be printed with the portrait of the head of King Edward VII, being on sale
in Grand Cayman on 20 December 1901 - the single exception being the £1 Salmon of the State of Victoria. All
values are known overprinted 'SPECIMEN' in black. Die Proofs of the King's Head only in a circle and of the Key
Plate, both in black on glazed card, were included in the display. There was a distinctive range of Colour Trials
issued in the '/id and I/- denominations, imperforate and on watermarked paper and these were also included in The series of 1905-06 came from the same POSTAGE-POSTAGE Key Plate but De La Rue adopted the new
watermark of Mult Crown CA with the same five values all of which were issued in March 1905 and from the same
Plate No 1. This issue is notable for the variety known as the 'G' flaw named after Mr L. V. S. Glover, who first
pointed out for the benefit of collectors, the small semi-circular dent under the first 'A' of 'CAYMAN' in the
bottom line of the Frame. This variety occurs on the right-hand (6th) stamp of the top row of the left pane.

Before dealing with the Surcharge and Manuscript Provisionals of 1908, it is important to note that on 8 November 1906, the Justices & Vestry of the Cayman Islands passed the Stamp Duty Law of 1906 with a view 'To raising additional revenue by the issue of a number of duties from One Penny to Two Guineas' and Clause 2 of that Law provided that such duties were to be paid by means of local stamps.

The third series of King Edward VII stamps was issued in March 1907. There were four values and for the first
time two colours were used, which included the Island's first high-value stamp — the 51— printed in salmon and
green. This latter value had been issued primarily for revenue purposes and the Cayman Post Office had expected
that this third-series issue would have been printed from the POSTAGE & REVENUE Key Plate but this did not
happen, the POSTAGE-POSTAGE Key Plate having been used again. This oversight or error has an important
bearing on the later need for Surcharges and Provisionals.
Accordingly, the Jamaican Post Office issued instructions that all remaining stocks of the single-colour
denominations were to be withdrawn, but in retrospect it seems likely that the real intention was to withdraw the
6d and I/- high values. However, there is little doubt that this instruction, coupled with the expectation that the
supplies of replacement low values printed from the POSTAGE & REVENUE Key Plate would be available shortly,
but which did not materialise, led to the later need for recourse to surcharges.
The depletion and eventual exhaustion of the low-value '/id and Id stamps was inevitable and happened
quickly. Therefore it became necessary for the Cayman Islands Commissioner to write to the Colonial Secretary
of Jamaica on 11 June 1907, making a formal request for the surcharging of '40 sheets of penny stamps of which I
have a good stock, with a request that they may be surcharged '/2d and returned to me as soon as possible,' etc.
The Colonial Secretary replied in a letter of 26 July 1907. After quoting from the 1893 circular despatch setting
out the undesirability of surcharging except in the most urgent cases, he went on 'As the Surchage in this case may
be regarded as NECESSARY FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE PUBLIC the Superintendent of the
Government Printing Office has been instructed to surcharge the stamps as requested, and I am to request that
you will not sell any of these stamps except across the counter', etc.
The replacement supplies of the awaited POSTAGE & REVENUE Key Plate low-value stamps failed to arrive so
that, by the middle of November 1907, the Commissioner of the Cayman Islands was forced to instruct the Post
Mistress, Miss G. A. Parsons, to surcharge 15 sheets of the current high-value 5/- stamp with the figure ID, so
providing 2,160 Id values for the immediate postal needs of these small Islands. This surcharging was carried out
by the Post Mistress herself with a 'toy' handstamp made up of pieces of metal type fixed into a wooden handle, all
put together by a local carpenter. This Surcharge was placed on sale on 23 November and lasted until 9
December. 

Many forgeries of the cancellations on used copies are known, together with forgeries of the
Surcharge itself.
Almost immediately after the 1D Surcharge ran out, the stock of  stamps expired and as replenishments were still not forthcoming, the Post Mistress was given renewed orders to surcharge 15 sheets of the same high
value 51- stamp with 'AD, the T and 'D' being identical with those used on the ID on 5Surcharge. It should be
noted, however, that no fraction bar was included. The supply of this value was placed on sale on 26 November
1907 and met demand until supplies of the POSTAGE & REVENUE printed stamps came to hand (Figure 4).
Replacements of the '1 1/2d Id values arrived in December 1907. printed from the POSTAGE* REVENUE key
plate, but it was not until March 1908 that supplies of the Z'/^d value became available (Figure 5). The earlier
instruction by the Jamaican PO to withdraw the 2!/2d value of the P-P key plate bi-colour issue, pending the
expected early arrival of the same value from the POSTAGE & REVENUE key plate, led to the exhaustion of the stock
of the 2'/2d stamps and the consequent need to resort to a further Surcharge. This took the form of an instruction
to the Inspector of Police, Mr J. H. O'Sullivan, to carry out the surcharging of four sheets of the current 4d stamp
with the overprint of 2Vi°. A metal handstamp was used and this was destroyed on the same day, so clearly the
four sheets were surcharged on the date of issue - 12.2.1908. The figures 1 and 2 and the letter'D'were in similar,
but smaller, type to the earlier Provisionals and with no fraction bar. The 480 stamps so surcharged, placed on
sale on 12 February, were sold out two days later. I showed examples of this Surcharge in unused and postally
used condition.
The later manuscript provisional resulted from two short periods (18-23 May 1908 and 4-16 October 1908)
when the temporary exhaustion of stock of the same low values coinciding with the reduction in the internal rate
of postage from '/kl to 'Ad for Postcards led to an instruction that any mail calling for denominations for which
stamps were not available must be paid for in cash over the PO counter. Therefore, the Post Mistress (Miss
G. A. Parsons) in May 1908, and her successor in October 1908, Mr W. J. McCausland, carried out this order by marking such mail in m/s that postage had been paid, supported by their initials, and later cancelled by the
Georgetown cds (Figure 6).
These Handstamp and Manuscript Surcharges and Provisionals led to very strong criticism at this time and,
quite soon, to accusations of dishonesty and abuse of authority by those in charge of postal affairs for the Cayman
Islands. It is important, therefore, to record that the result of the Official Enquiry by the Governor of Jamaica led
to the Colonial Secretary writing in the following terms. After the preamble and reference to the reason for the
Enquiry, the Earl of Crewe, Colonial Secretary, stated 'I am of opinion that Mr C. G. Hirst-the Cayman Islands
Commissioner - has successfully replied to the allegations made by the Dealers, and I approve of you communicating
with him in the fullest sense' etc, etc.

The previously mentioned reduction in postal rates for inland mail led to the demand for a FARTHING stamp.
De La Rue designed and printed these stamps using the typo process instead of litho. The printing fell far below
their usual high standard so that minor varieties abound. This issue is particularly notable as being the only one issued by a Colony where the 'Ad value is the sole denomination of that issue. For examples of the FARTHING
Die Proofs and issued stamps, see Figures 7 and 8.
The FARTHING Stamp was intended for internal use only, but in October 1908, owing to the lack of '/id
stamps, temporary sanction was given for the Vid stamp to be used for foreign mail.
At this critical time in the development of the postal service in these small Islands, still a Dependency of
Jamaica, the Cayman PO had instituted a Local Collection and Delivery service under the heading of RURAL
POSTS (Figure 9). It is uncertain when these Services started but undoubtedly they were in operation in 1908. A
Mail Cart moved between Georgetown and Boddentown on 3 days per week, and during 1908 the facility was
extended to East End by a Messenger who rode on horseback. Both the Mail Cart and the Waggoner, also the
Messenger, collected and delivered mail and sold stamps. A special OBLITERATOR was issued to the
Waggoner and initially he applied it to all mail collected, but later on to local letters only; those for overseas were
taken to Georgetown and cancelled there. A similar service between Georgetown and West End existed between
1909 and 1913 but this ceased when the West Bay PO opened in July 1913.
Postal Stationery was introduced for the use of the Commissioner in 1900, being a white envelope with the
inscription 'ON HER MAJESTY'S SERVICE'. In 1901, the Commissioner requested that the Colonial Secretary of
Jamaica would arrange for a supply of 'Ad and '/id Wrappers, together with a supply of Vid Postcards. Eventually,
after the lapse of several years, an issue of two sizes of 'Ad PCs was placed on sale in June and December 1908.
There followed the lAd wrapper (23.6.1909), the Id PC and the Id Envelope (28.12.1909). The last value to be
issued was the 2'/id Envelope on 13.11.1911. All values are known overprinted 'SPECIMEN' in black. De La Rue
submitted Die Proofs in colour of each denomination and examples were included in the Display. It should be
mentioned that DLR made a trial printing of the Id Postcard in 1904, fully four years before the Crown Agents
ordered supplies of Postal Stationery in the four values. This trial and some Die Proofs are illustrated in Figures 7,
10 and 11.
The death of King Edward VII on 10 May 1910 made it essential to have a new series of stamps because of the
King's head forming part of the design. The requisition for stamps printed from the Universal Key Plate with the
portrait of King George V was dated April 1911, although it had been expected that supplies would have been
available earlier. Because of the difficulties experienced by the printers in times of war in the supply of reliable
papers and dyestuffs, classification of the various papers used in the printing of this issue causes some difficulty.

As an example, when the Roughway Mills in 1912 were forced to close, this was a major blow, as this Mill had been the main source of supply of paper for Colonial stamps. Stocks of yellow and green paper became very low
so that these were at first conserved and used for the production of recess-printed stamps. This disruption led to
many variations in paper thickness, paper with the appearance of 'blue-green' instead of green and the supply ofvarious values printed with either white or yellow-backed paper. The stamps of this issue present an interesting
study in relation to the difficulties experienced by printers who contended with the disruption of supplies under
war-time conditions.
During the 1914-18 War, Governments searched for means of raising additional revenue and were quick to
impose a tax on letters, which took the form of a general raising of rates of postage. Early in 1916 Jamaica had
imposed a 'War Tax' on certain letters, so that at a Statutory Meeting, the Justices and Vestry of the Cayman
Islands adopted a similar course. The War Stamps series can be divided into eight issues, four of which were
produced in Jamaica, and the remainder in London. Demand for these issues by dealers was enormous. Varieties
of print spacing, setting of letters and full stops, etc, are numerous and the printings had little of real interest or
attraction. The exception, so far as rarity is concerned, is the \Vzd on 2'Ad Blue London print with the 'rare'
overprint showing the 'R' of 'War' with a curved foot and other letters vary slightly from the sheets printed from
the September 1917 print. It is believed that 5 panes only were printed with this 'rare' type and that they were sold
without any variation having been detected.
The second series of King George V has great attraction because of its simplicity of design and the superb recess printing by De La Rue & Co supported by the clear and fresh colours chosen for all values. The initial printing was
on Mult Crown CA Wmk with the remaining values printed on Mult Script CA paper between 1922 and 1926.
Figure 12 shows the master Die Proof of the King's Head with engraver's centre lines intact.
1 close this brief account of the highlights of Cayman Islands' philatelic and postal history with the A. S. Rutty
m/s provisional. On 9-10 November 1932, the Post Office at Cayman Brae was destroyed by a hurricane. The
stock of stamps and the obliterator were all lost. Consequently, letters on which postage was to be paid were
franked by the initials of the Post Master - Mr A. S. Rutty. The handstamp with 'POSTAGE PAID' within a
rectangle and initialled 'ASR' was affixed and then such letters were sent to Kingston, Jamaica for the cds cancellation and onwards transmission. It is believed that about 300 such letters bore this rare franking before the
Cayman Brae obliterator was recovered. It is surprising that this temporary handstamp is not accorded catalogue
inclusion by Gibbons as a Provisional Surcharge (Figure 13).
