\chapter{1917-20 War Tax}


During World War I, many governments in a way to balance their revenue and to contribute funds to the War imposed tax on letters, in some instances, this took the general form of raising of postage rates and in others the collection of a special fee on certain classes of mail. Early in 1916 Jamaica imposed a War Tax on certain letetrs and the measure became popular especially in the West Indies. At a meeting of the Justices and Vestry held on September 20th, 1916 in Georgetown, a Cayman islands Post Office (War Tax) Law No. 4 1916 was introduced. The Governor of Jamaica---W.H. Manning---signed his approval of the Law on November 15th, 1916 the terms of which were as follows:

\end{blockquote}

The Law came into force on February 26th, 1917. A Public Notice was posted up in Georgetown the previous week which read:

\begin{blockquote}
``In accordance with Section 2 of Law 4, 1916, a Law to impose a special War Tax on certain post letters, I hereby appoint Monday, February 26th as the day on which this Law shall come into full force and effect''.

\SignatureR{19th February\hfill\hfill\hfill\hfill\hfill  Signed. A. C. Robinson, Commissioner.''}
\end{blockquote}


The Post office took the necesary steps to prepare for the new postage and war Tax and teh complete stock of the 2 1/2d. denomination on hand at Georgetown comprising 200 sheets of 120 (24,000 stamps) was shipped to Kingston, Jamaica to be surcharged ``War Stamp 1 1/2 d''. With the news of the passing of the Law orders from dealers and the public reached Georgetown in such huge quantities that it is reported that the whole of the first printing was pre-sold.

In order to ease the situation teh Acting Commissioner decided to defer the issue until a further consignment of the 2\half d. denomination, that had already been ordered from London, was received. Due to irregular communications the consignment did not reach Georgetown via Jamaica, until january 2nd, 1917. It was then sent back to Jamaica by next schooner to be surcharged. The two printings in different types were placed on sale on February 26th, 1917. Apparently none was sent to Cayman Brac. 

The original (small type) printing sold out on the date of the issue and the second (large type) printing lasted for a month. 

As the shortage was anticiapted permission was obtained to order an entirely new War stamp which was to be 1 1/2d. with an appropriate overprint. 

The order was sent to London on February 20th and it has to be assumed that in the interval between the receipt of this new issue the War Tax was paid by ordinary stamps. 

On April 12th the Crown Agents referred the requisition to the Secreatry of State pointng out that the Cayman Islands had no 1 1/2d. duty plate and that the cost of having one made would be heavy. In addition a temporary plate would have to be made for the words "War Stamp"  for the overprint. In the circumstances it was recommennded taht a further supply of the 2 1/2d. stamps should be printed and overprinted with the surcharge. This suggestion was approved by the Secretary of State on May 5th, 1917 and in a subsequent issue of the Colonial office Journal the following announcement appeared:

\begin{blockquote}
A supply of 1 1/2d. War Stamps has been ordered, and as no 1 1/2d. duty plate is in existence it has been decided toproduce these stamps by overprinting the 2 1/2d. duty plate with 1 1/2d. duty with 1 1/2d. and the words "War Stamps" in black. The 2 1/2d. stamps required for this purpose will be taken from a new supply of 2 1/2d. which is course of printing.

This supply which also included some sheets of the rare type was received and placed on sale at Georgetown on September 4th, 1917 and on the same day a reprint of the second type of Jamaica surcharge was also issued. 

Meanwhile the annual meeting of the Justices and Vestry had been held and for some reason no steps were taken for continuation of Law 4 of 1916 beyond February 26th, 1918 which was its date of expiry.

The Law therefore lapsed and postage rates automatically returned to the level at which tehy had stood before the imposition of the War Tax. This omission was remedied at a special meeting called on April 18th, 1918 when Law 1 of 1918 was passed which reimposed the \half d. War Tax on certain letters. The tax was to continue for a period of eighteen months from its commencement. It received the approval of the Governor of Jamaica on May 8th, and became effective from May 27th, 1918. 

In view of the reimposition of the tax a further requisition was prepared at Georgetown on April 30th 1918. The order included not only a supply of 1 1/2d. stamps in the new orange colour but also a 1/2d. stamps overprintd "WAR STAMP." The stamps were printed in London and issued at Georgetown on February 4th, and at Cayman Brac on March 12th, 1919 respctively.

The printings were large and lasted for the remainder of the period during which the War Tax was effective. In February, 1920 it was deceided presumably as a measure of economy, to use up some of teh large stock of the 2d. stamps and a supply was forwarded to Jamaica to be overprinted. They were returned to Georgetown and palced on sale on March 10th, 1920. Later that month a further lot was sent to Jamaica with a request that the overprint be made in red; this was carried out and the stamps were packed ready for return teh following month. It so happened that the Commissioner paid a visit to Cayman Brac early in april and noticed that the mail was not being charged with the extra tax; on enquiring the reason he was reminded taht the tax Law had lapsed on november 27th, 1919. He at once realized taht the second supply of teh overprinted 2d. stamps were not required and instructions were sent to jamaica for the consignment taht was awaiting dispatch to be destroyed.  All the remaining stocks were either destroyed or sold as remainders in London.

All except one copy of the red surcharge were destroyed, and it might well be the rarest of all cayman Island stamps. Colonel D.G.N. Lloyd-Lowles, during his display on the Cayman Islands to the Royal Philatelic Society, told the story of it having formed part of the Watkin and Meredith collections and was offered by Mr. Watkin to `Bro. Ainger' a fellow collector in 1933 at \pound25. `I cannot take it myself' he wrote, but evidently Bro. Ainger couldn't either. The stamp fetched \pound33 in the Watkn sale in 1946 and only \pound24 in teh Meredith sale.
