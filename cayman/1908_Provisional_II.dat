\chapter{The 1d. on Fourpence Fiscal Provisional}

In May, 1908 teh stock of low value stamps at Georgetown Post Office ran out and pending the arrival of a fresh consignment that was expected at the beginning of June postage for small amounts on a letter was paid by cash over the counter. During this hsortage an American applied for a sheet of 1d. stamps which he required for receipt purposes. On being informed that none were available he lodged a complaint and as a result the Commissioner gave instructions for a small quantity of 4d. stamps to be surcharged "1 D" on the strict understanding taht they were to be be used solely for for fiscal and not postal use.

One complete sheet was sold to the American and the remainder disposed of singly to applicants unless evidence could be produced taht more were genuinely needed. 

It is recorded that an aendeavour was made by someone some months later to pass a letter through the post bearing a copy and another stamp. It was however, detected and reached the addressee with a red ink cancellation and the words "Fiscal only" in manuscript. the following notice was also attached: "The Provisional 1d. on 4d. on the envelope was issued for Fiscal purposes only, and may not be used for Postage. (Signed) W. G. McC., P.M."
