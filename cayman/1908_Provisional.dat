\chapter{The 2 1/2d on Fourpence Provisional 1908}



The arrival of a fresh supply of 1/2d and 1d. stamps of the "POSTAGE \& REVENUE" type on December 27th, 1907 filled the void that had rendered necessary the former provisionals and it was hoped by everyone that the period of surcharging had come to an end. By the end of January 1908, however, these two denominations were running low; the stock of the 2 1/2d was almost exhausted and the number of 4d. stamps remaining was not large.

The situation did not give rise to any concerns since it was expected that a replenishment of teh low values, at least, would arrive by a steamer due at the end of February.

These plans were completely upset by the unexpected arrival of teh steam yacht \textit{Zenaida} at Georgetown on february 12th, 1908.

In order to ease the situation four sheets of the current 4d. stamp were handed to teh Inspector of Police---Mr. J.H. O'Sullivan---with the instructions to surcharge them with "2 1/2 D."  They were placed on sale at once and were sold out on February 14th just two days later. A metal handstamp was employed for the surcharging which was destroyed at once so it is obvious that all the sheets were handstamped the same day. Both the figures "I" and "2" and teh letter "D" were in similar but somewhat smaller font to those used on earlier provisionals and again there was no fraction bar. 

There ar about six copies with the surcharge double, the most important one originally from the collections of  Prappas and Gibralter and which eventually found its way the Maisl collection. This double surcharge is much more distinct than the one in the other pair residing in the Royal Collection. We have used the combined catalog of a single and the error, but this figure in no way reflects the rarity or the premium deserved by this se-tenant multiple. One of the world's most important rarities and a crowning jewel to an award-winning collection of Cayman Islands or a serious British collection. Accompanied by a 1967 RPS certificate; ex-Prappas, Gibralte

2238	og	S.G. #35, 35a	imageS.G. #35, 35a, 1908 "2 1/2D" Surcharge on 4p Brown and blue, double surcharge, the celebrated horizontal pair with the double surcharge se-tenant with a normal surcharge, the right stamp clearly showing complete doubling, wonderfully well centered, o.g., trivial barely perceptible toned spot in the right stamp of little consequence, very fine and especially choice.The surcharge varieties of the Cayman Islands have given us some of the great rarities of the Cayman Islands, as well as of the entire British Empire. The "2 1/2D" surcharge on Four Pence King Edward VII is no exception to this. The current census shows that there are two mint examples, two used examples and two pairs with the error se-tenant with the normal. This last differs only in that the other pair is found in the Royal collection.The pair offered here is the only known example in private hands. Furthermore the quality of the double surcharge is outstanding, being distinct in all four elements of the surcharge and being displaced from each other by as much as a full millimeter. This stands in contrast to most of the six known examples in that most show only a partially doubling. In fact this double surcharge is much more distinct than the one in the other pair residing in the Royal Collection. We have used the combined catalog of a single and the error, but this figure in no way reflects the rarity or the premium deserved by this se-tenant multiple. One of the world's most important rarities and a crowning jewel to an award-winning collection of Cayman Islands or a serious British collection.

2236	c	S.G. #35	imageS.G. #35, 1908 "2 1/2D" Surcharge on 4p Brown and blue, exceptionally well centered single tied to attractive and clean "On His Majesty's Service" cover to the United States from Gwendolyn Parsons, the postmistress of the Cayman Islands, includes a letter from her to this addressee datelined February 20th that makes reference to this provisional and states that there were only two sheets surcharged!, the stamp is tied by a light strike of "George Town/Grand Cayman/MR 3 08" c.d.s., Type 4 pmk., posted to New Bedford, Mass. with Kingston, Jamaica transit on the reverse, extremely fine in all regards; this usage is exactly the purpose that this provisional surcharge was intended to fulfill, as the supply of 2 1/2p values for the foreign letter rate had been exhausted, this marvelous cover shows this usage in the proper time period before the new supply of 2 1/2p King Edward Postage \& Revenue stamps were issued at the end of March; this is believed to be one of only four covers franked with this surcharge and also one of less than that which is a properly used commercial cover in such superlative condition; a highly important postal history rarity of the Cayman Islands; 1988 BPA certificate; ex-Marston, Cooley (Scott #20).

2235	F	S.G. #35	imageS.G. #35, 1908 "2 1/2D" Surcharge on 4p Brown and blue, tied to a most unusual "On His Majesty's Service" registered cover to England, originally franked with 1/2p Green block of four and 1p Carmine single (S.G. 25, 26), both tied by "George Town/Grand Cayman/FE 10 08" c.d.s., Type 4 pmk., this was the proper commercial franking for the 1p Empire letter rate and 2p registry fee, then a "2 1/2D" Surcharged stamp was applied two days later and tied by a similar Georgetown c.d.s. dated February 12, 1908, the first day of issuance, a small note in the hand of the postmistress at left states "just surcharged 2 1/2 on 4", this cover routed through Cuba with Havana transit and backstamped Darlington, both stamps and cover are fresh and attractive, the surcharge value is remarkably well centered with strong rich colors and a perfect strike of the surcharge, filing pinholes to the top left of the cover, very fine and exceedingly choice.Gwendolyn Parsons, the postmistress of the Cayman Islands, was well known for her excellent service to collectors and dealers alike, much to the chagrin of the higher postal authorities. The stamps of the Cayman Islands quickly drew the attention of philatelists around the world and it was her desire to meet their demands, which were considerable. These demands actually led to shortages of stamps that plagued the Islands in 1907-1908. The surcharging of stamps only exacerbated the problem because everyone wanted them. This cover shows her desires to please one of her good customers by applying this new provisional on a cover because she knew he would be pleased to receive it. As Richard Maisel notes "The cover is therefore a commercial or a philatelic cover or both depending on how one chooses to look at it." The "2 1/2D" Surcharge on the Four Pence King Edward is the scarcest of all provisional surcharges. This fact illustrates itself from the individual stamps to the varieties as well as its usages. The total census of covers with this value stands at a mere four examples. All have interesting and differing aspects to them. The cover offered here is one of only two covers with this rare provisional used on the first day of issue. And in addition it gives us a fascinating insight into the functioning of the Cayman Islands postal service and, as was noted in the Meredith sale, this is probably the best vouched for example of this surcharge; 1984 PF and 1996 BPA certificates; ex-Watkins, Meredith (Scott #20).
