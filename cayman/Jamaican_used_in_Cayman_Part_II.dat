## Jamaica Stamps Used In The Cayman Islands
<div style="width:32%;float:left">
<strong>In this article we continue with descriptions of the various cancellations of the cayman Islands
on jamaican stamps.</strong> 

We cover SG Z19-Z28 with Z19 on 1p rose official and also a number of the boxed 
<strong>Cayman Brac/Cayman Islands</strong> handstamp. These are much more expensive and rare than the ones
described in the first part of this article. Both the condition of the stamp as well as how clear the cancellation
is affect pricing and consider this if you bidding in any of the auctions. With current prices if the provenance
of a cove ror piece is unknown, rather buy with a certificate.
