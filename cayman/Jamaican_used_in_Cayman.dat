##SG #Z7 Cover with Bisect

<div style="width:64%;float:left">
<img src="http://localhost/egypt/cayman/SG-Z7-cover.jpg"    />
<p style="font-size:smaller"> A great rarity of the early Jamaican period; ex-Green 
</p>
</div>
S.G. #Z7, 7 var., 1p Purple and mauve vertical pair and diagonal bisect, tied to cover to the United Sates by easily identifiable purple "Grand Cayman/P. O./JY 7 1896" c.d.s. ("7" inverted), the Type Z2 postmark of Georgetown, via Lucea and Kingston, Jamaica with transit c.d.s. on the reverse, this cover entered the United States through Boston with that city's August 27, 1896 flag machine cancel, backstamped New York, stamps are attractive and well centered with only a few toned perforations, cover is completely intact with mild edge wear causing minor creases at right and a tiny edge tear at bottom, a very fine example of Jamaican stamps used in in the Cayman Islands with this exceptionally scarce cancel.Records do not provide us with the necessary information as to why this bisect was necessary, but the normal reason was a temporary shortage of the appropriate adhesives for the correct rate. This cover is a commercial usage to Messrs. Middleton & Co. of New York City at the corner of Beaver and Broad Streets. The correct rate was 2 1/2p for foreign mail for which the pair and bisect were accepted throughout its travels as proper payment.The use of Jamaican stamps in the Cayman Islands provides the collector with a wonderful group of forerunners, all of which are exceptionally scarce as stamps with the various postmarks of the Cayman Islands. On the other hand, covers with these cancels are of the greatest rarity, with only a handful of covers known for each postmark. The cover offered here reaches new heights as this is the only known bisect of Jamaica used in the Cayman Islands. A great rarity of the early Jamaican period; ex-Green (Scott #A11, 11 var.).    	Est. 15,000-20,000

SOLD for $35,000.00

<strong>S.G. #Z8</strong>S.G. #Z8, 2 1/2p Dull purple and blue, exceptionally well centered single with large portion of purple single-circle Grand Cayman c.d.s. Type Z2 pmk. of Georgetown, an early use of this cancellation dated May 11, 1895, light and barely noticeable vertical crease, very fine appearance; clear 1984 BPA certificate; ex-Green (Scott #A12; $925.00)    	\pound800

S.G. #Z8, 2 1/2p Dull purple and blue, tied to large portion of a cover to Provincetown, Mass. by an especially clear strike of the black "Grand Cayman/P.O./MY 3 1895" c.d.s. Type Z2 Georgetown pmk., Kingston, Jamaica transit c.d.s. and Provincetown backstamp, cover has been strongly reduced at left with tears to the reverse and a portion of the backflap missing, quite attractive from the front with only mild edge wear and a faint corner crease to the stamp, very fine appearance; this cancel is found in both violet and black but our observations are that the black cancel is much scarcer than the violet, especially since this is a very early usage of this postmark, an extremely rare cover with only a few examples known, and especially choice with this excellent strike of the Type Z2 postmark of Georgetown in black; ex-Green (Scott #A12).    	Est. 4,000-5,000

SOLD for $4,750.00
