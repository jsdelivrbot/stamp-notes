\chapter{The Issued Stamps} 

Many formalities were necessary before the issue of the first Cayman Island stamps, the chief being the approval of the jamaican Assembly and the Justices and Vesrty of the Cayman Islands.

It is recorded that a requisition was sent to the Crown Agents on April 27th 1900 who, with the approval of the Secretary of State, instructed Thomas De La Rue and Co. to print the stamps from their Universal key plate also known as the General Colonial key late. 

The design consists of a rectangle 22 1/2 by 18.5 mm having in the centre a circle within a square embidying a small portrait of Queen Victoria with the word "POSTAGE" on either side in a narrow vertical tablet. The stamps were surface printed in sheets of 120 arranged in two panes 60 side by side. The name and denominations appear in tablets at the top and bottom respectively and were inserted a a second operation from what is known as "duty plate" and bieng comprised of sixty impressions had to be applied twice to the sheets of stamps.
