\chapter{Centenary}
In the Crown Agents' Stamp Bulletin published in October, 1932 the following official description of the stamps was given:

\begin{quotation}
The design consists of vignettes of H.M. the King and King William IV and a border includes palm trees and turtles. The name of the colony is at the top with the words `POSTAGE \& REVENUE' immediately beneath. In the top left and right hand corners are the commemorative dates 1832 and 1932 and the duty tablets are placed centrally at the base. Oblong shape stamps approximate size 41 mm. by 27 mm.
\end{quotation}

The stamps were engraved and printed in recess by Waterlow \& Sons Ltd. whose imprint appears in the lower margin in small uncoloured letters. The sheets consisted of sixty stamps (10 rows of 6) and were on the usual Script CA paper. Shades of some denominations are said to exist which is not unlikely since all values except the 1d. and 2\half d were reprinted.

The stamps were placed on sale at Georgetown and cayman Brac on December 5th and 20th, 1932 respectively. The issue was withdrawn from sale at Cayman Brac on March 20th, 1934 after only fifteen months life and the surplus stock returned to Georgetown for destruction. At Georgetown, however, the series remained on sale until May 5th, 1934 when it was withdrawn and replaced by the previous recess-printed issue.

A possibly unique photographic essay from the Marston and Green collections shows an unaccepted essay of an artist's design, which was reduced to stamp size. It shows a three quarter facing portrait bust of King George V and King William IV see Figure~\ref{essay}
