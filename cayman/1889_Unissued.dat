2037	E		Jamaica 1889 1p Purple and mauve with "Cayman/Islands" overprint in capital letters, an unused single with partial o.g., small gum stains on the reverse showing slightly to the front on a couple perf. tips at top, otherwise very fine; it is believed that this overprint was produced about 1891, the status of this overprint has never been fully determined, but it is believed by students to be an essay or an unissued value produced by the Jamaican Post Office for use in the Cayman Islands which was using Jamaican stamps there at that the time; its legitimacy has long been recognized because of the distinctive type of the first "A" in "Cayman" which shows a foot on the left leg, this same type irregularity is found on the 1/2p Green with thin "Official" overprint (copy enclosed for comparison), the official overprint was produced locally by C. Vendryes of Kingston, also the right upright of the "N" is short, another known type characteristic of this printer; whether an essay or an unissued overprint this example and the used example in the next lot are the only known surviving examples; a marvelous rarity of the early postal history of the Cayman Islands; these two stamps are specifically mentioned in the Stanley Gibbons introduction to Cayman Islands, but are not listed; 1988 Peter Holcombe certificate; ex-Meredith.   	 Est. 5,000-7,500 

SOLD for $6,250.00 


2038	E		Jamaica 1889 1p Purple and mauve with "Cayman/Islands" overprint in capital letters, the very rare overprint essay or unissued overprint, an interesting used single with a portion of a Richmond, Jamaica cancel dated May 31, 1897, perforations slightly clipped at bottom, fine; the use of this stamp is shrouded in mystery as much as the overprint itself, this cancel may have been applied by favor or it may have been used by someone who came across the stamp not recognizing the overprint, in any case this example and the unused example in the previous lot are the only known surviving examples of these Cayman Islands rarities; these two stamps are specifically mention in the Stanley Gibbons introduction to Cayman Islandss, but are not listed; photocopy of 1988 Peter Holcombe certificate for the two stamps; ex-Meredith.   	 Est. 4,000-5,000
