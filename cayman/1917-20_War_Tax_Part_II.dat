293	O	S.G. #55	imageS.G. #55, 1917 "WAR STAMP 1 1/2d" Surcharge on 2 1/2p Deep blue, lovely single tied to exquisite piece by "Georgetown/Grand Cayman/SP 10 17" c.d.s., Type 5 pmk., both the stamp and piece are especially clean and fresh, bright vivid color, quite well centered, very fine and exceedingly choice; as we have noted, any example of this rejected surcharge is exceptionally scarce, but any postally used piece is incredibly rare as far less were used than remained mint, and many of those were lost or thrown away; a wonderful opportunity to acquire a select used example that is missing from even the most advanced British Commonwealth used collections; 1992 Peter Holcombe certificate; ex-Marston (Scott #MR3; $2,250.00). (Image)	 £1,900 
SOLD for $2,500.00.}

2290	hPB	S.G. #53, 53b	imageS.G. #53, 53b, "WAR STAMP 1 1/2d" surcharge on 2 1/2p Deep blue, no period after "Stamp", the small surcharge printed at Kingston in two steps, top right corner margin plate no. 5 block of six (3x2), the variety being the top left stamp (position R 1/4), slightly yellow o.g., stamps are n.h., minor perf. separation in the top selvage, very fine; the variety with period entirely omitted is actually quite rare, even though we know what position it is found in, it must have dropped out during production because many multiples with that position have the period present; ex-Green (Scott #MR1 var.).

2292	og/nh PB	S.G. #55, 1917 "WAR STAMP 1 1/2d" Surcharge on 2 1/2p Deep blue, bottom right corner margin plate no. 5 block of six (3x2), a lovely block possessing bright strong color, fairly well centered, o.g., lightly hinged in the in the top strip, bottom strip is never hinged, some perf. separation in the left vertical row and inconsequential corner creases in the selvage, fine-very fine; this rare surcharge was exactly as intended by De La Rue, however after they got into production it was decided that the figures of value were not large enough to hide the old denomination so a revision was made, only about four sheets of this rejected issue were mixed in with the shipment to the Caymans and were sold; very few multiples above a block of four are known to yet exist, and a position block such as this is especially rare, as no more than twelve to sixteen plate blocks were originally issued and certainly far less that that exist today; 1998 BPA certificate (Scott #MR3; $5,400.00+ for hinged). (Image)	 for hinged £4,500+ 
SOLD for $12,000.00.}
