\chapter{Postal Stationery}

The Cayman Islands only issued a limited number of postal stationery. On February 2nd, 1901, the Commissioner wrote to the Colonial Secretary of Jamaica enclosing an order for 1/4d. and 1/2d stamps, also 1000 1/4d. postcards to be forwarded to the Crown Agents. It was accompanied by a rough sketch of a suggested design for the 1/4d. stamp which he considered on the score of economy should also be used for the postcard.

Est. 200-300 
SOLD for $400.00.}

An initial supply of these postcards was placed on sale on June 30th, 1908 but within a short while it was decided that the size was not satisfactory and accordingly a further printing was ordered with a request taht they should be "at least twice the size of our present issue."  The Governor of Jamaica agreed in principle and stated that in future the cards would be the same size as those used at the time in Jamaica.

It seems somewhat extraordinary, but nevertheless true, that no further stationery was issued in the islands until the advent of the QE II Air Letter. Air letters are known used bearing a KG VI 6d. adhesive stamp and it must be assumed taht a supply of plain unstamped air letters was sent to Georgetown for use in the islands. Since these letters were unstamped no securit yprinting was involved, and therefore teh Crown Agents were not concerned with their issue. No special authority was required for thei use for ordinarypostal purposes at the required rate.
