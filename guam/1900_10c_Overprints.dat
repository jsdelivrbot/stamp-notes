FINE. THE UNIQUE IMPRINT AND PLATE NUMBER STRIP OF THREE OF THE 10-CENT TYPE I GUAM 1900 SPECIAL PRINTING.

The plate used for the Guam 10c Special Printing, plate no. 932, is the only plate that contains both Type I and Type II stamps. Seven positions on the various panes are Type II, while the remainder are Type I. The plate number multiple offered here must come from the bottom left pane, because one of the three Type II positions on that pane -- which comes from the position above the center stamp of this strip and is offered in the following lot -- confirms the pane position. It is also confirmed, because the preceding lot, the only other possible plate number position, is from the left.

Ex Todd. Scott Retail as singles with no premium for the imprint and plate number

\subsection{Type II}
\ph[25%]{../guam/1035.jpg}{1035		1900, 10c Brown, Ty. II, Special Printing (9SP). Unused (no gum), pencil "Spl. Ptg. J. M. B." (Bartels) on back (indicating gum loss occurred a long time ago), bright color, thin spot
FINE APPEARANCE. THE GUAM 10-CENT TYPE II IS THE RAREST OF ALL UNITED STATES POSSESSIONS SPECIAL PRINTINGS -- ONLY THREE CAN POSSIBLY EXIST AND THIS IS THE ONLY EXAMPLE WE ARE AWARE OF.

The plate used for the Guam 10c Special Printing, plate no. 932, is the only plate that contains both Type I and Type II stamps. Seven positions on the four panes are Type II, while the remainder are Type I. The stamp offered here is Position 86 on the pane, and comes from the position directly above the center stamp in the imprint and plate number strip of three offered in the previous lot -- the perfs match up perfectly as does the centering. Therefore, the pane used for the Special Printing must be the bottom left pane of the sheet. This bottom left pane also contains two other positions which were Type II (Positions 61 and 71). We do not know whether they survived, as some stamps were overprinted "Specimen" for use at the Paris and Pan-American Expositions and were destroyed shortly afterwards.

Ex Todd. Scott Catalogue does not list the Type II as a Special Printing, but this stamp should be the basis for a future listing. Scott Retail as normal No. 9
