VERY FINE-EXTREMELY FINE. THIS IS WITHOUT QUESTION THE FINEST PLATE BLOCK OF THE 1899 50-CENT GUAM OVERPRINT ISSUE IN EXISTENCE.

Our informal research found five other plate blocks. The block offered here is superior to those found in Lilly (part original gum), Tows (tropical tissue adhering to gum), Todd (thin at top left) and Wampler. None was offered in our 1989 specialized catalogue of Guam.
