\chapter{PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.}

\newthought{The} following pages contain an account of certain mathematical
recreations, problems, and speculations of past
and present times. I hasten to add that the conclusions are
of no practical use, and most of the results are not new. If
therefore the reader proceeds further he is at least forewarned.

At the same time I think I may assert that many of the
diversions---particularly those in the latter half of the book---are
interesting, not a few are associated with the names of
distinguished mathematicians, while hitherto several of the
memoirs quoted have not been easily accessible to English
readers.

The book is divided into two parts, but in both parts I have
included questions which involve advanced mathematics.

The \emph{\hyperlink{part.1}{first part}} consists of seven chapters, in which are
included various problems and amusements of the kind usually
called \emph{mathematical recreations}. The questions discussed in
the first of these chapters are connected with \hyperlink{chapter.1}{arithmetic}; those
in the second with \hyperlink{chapter.2}{geometry}; and those in the third relate to
\hyperlink{chapter.3}{mechanics}. The \hyperlink{chapter.4}{fourth chapter} contains an account of some
miscellaneous problems which involve both number and situation;
the \hyperlink{chapter.5}{fifth chapter} contains a concise account of magic
squares; and the \hyperlink{chapter.6}{sixth and seventh} chapters deal with some

unicursal problems. Several of the questions mentioned in
the first three chapters are of a somewhat trivial character,
and had they been treated in any standard English work to
which I could have referred the reader, I should have pointed
them out. In the absence of such a work, I thought it best
to insert them and trust to the judicious reader to omit them
altogether or to skim them as he feels inclined.

The \emph{\hyperlink{part.2}{second part}} consists of five chapters, which are mostly
\emph{historical}. They deal respectively with \hyperlink{chapter.8}{three classical problems}
in geometry---namely, the duplication of the cube, the trisection
of an angle, and the quadrature of the circle---\hyperlink{chapter.10}{astrology},
the hypotheses as to the nature of \hyperlink{chapter.12}{space} and \hyperlink{chapter.14}{mass}, and a
means of \hyperlink{chapter.13}{measuring time}.

I have inserted detailed references, as far as I know, as
to the sources of the various questions and solutions given;
also, wherever I have given only the result of a theorem, I have
tried to indicate authorities where a proof may be found. In
general, unless it is stated otherwise, I have taken the references
direct from the original works; but, in spite of considerable
time spent in verifying them, I dare not suppose that they are
free from all errors or misprints.

I shall be grateful for notices of additions or corrections
which may occur to any of my readers.
