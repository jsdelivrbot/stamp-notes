\section{Guam Postmark Part 2}

#### Spanish Marianas Postmarks and Cancellers
In addition to the postmark that arrived on \textit{Yosemite}, 
several old Spanish markings were found in Government House in Agana, and it is believed that they were 
used there temporarily by Assistant Postmaster Perez, a 
native Guamanian, while Hobby conducted the postal 
business on board \textit{Yosemite}.  The cds was inscribed  "Marianas" and did not have a year date.  It was usually accompanied by an oval killer filled with dots and 
a star in the center. Registered mail was designated by 
an additional strike of a rectangle inscribed "CERTIF."   These markings are recorded as used between August  17 and December 8, 1899.  The earliest registered letter 
from Guam is shown as Figure 5.

#### San Luis D' Apra, Guam Straight Line Canceller
Not all of the postal activity was at Agana during this 
period.  A second post office was opened at San Luis 
d'Apra, a bay south of Agana that provided a better anchorage.  Figure 1 shows a cover with the first San Luis 
postmark, a straight-line device recorded as being used 
from December 9, 1899 to July 11, 1900.
