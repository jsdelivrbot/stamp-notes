\ph[60%]{../guam/1001.jpg}{1001	1899, 10c Brown, Ty. II (9). Horizontal pair, unused (no gum), bright color
FINE. THIS IS THE LARGEST RECORDED MULTIPLE OF THE GUAM 10-CENT TYPE II ISSUE. A GREAT RARITY OF GUAM PHILATELY.
The plate used for the Guam 10c Special Printing, plate no. 932, is the only plate that contains both Type I and Type II stamps. Seven positions on the various panes are Type II, while the remainder are Type I. The multiple offered here must come from Positions 11, 12 or 13, the only Type II's on the plate forming a contiguous horizontal multiple. The fact that this pair has no gum indicates it is probably the Special Printing (see lots 1015, 1034-1035).
