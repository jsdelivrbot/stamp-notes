164  	 	FERNANDO PO - OFFICER'S 6d CONCESSION RATE COVER EX ANTI-SLAVERY SQUADRON AT LANDANA; Fine 11/12 Oct. 1863 env. (+ contents - interesting reading about life on ship, court martials and bemoaning the fact that "we have not taken any slavers yet...") written from "Landano[/a], 60 miles N[orth] of Congo" on board ship ("The Zebra is a very nice ship...") to Sussex franked by six GB 1d 'stars' (originally a Block of Six) tied/cancelled by v. fine Liverpool "466" numerals matching the fine red "PAID/LIVERPOOL/BR. PACKET" c.d.s. on the front. The arrival date at Liverpool (10 Dec. 1863) fits with the SS Retriever's arrival from Fernando Po (she left there 29 Oct. & reached Liverpool 10 Dec.); it reached Fernando Po on 24 Oct. on HMS Griffon which had taken the ship's bag from HMS Zebra en route. Landana was to become part of Angola in the 1880s, but at this time was a relatively unexplored part of the Congo basin; Richard Burton noted what a terrible place it was in the 1860s when it was still a destination for 'explorers', and 1863 was a particularly bad year for the 'white men' in Fernando Po - Burton notes that 78 of the 250 on the island were wiped out by yellow fever in that summer! Rare letter routed through Fernando Po at this early date soon after the first 
Consular PO had opened there. [Illustrated in NOL, p.11.] PHOTO

The letter talks of life on board ship and mentions a recent expedition to Jellah Coffee in a small boat to collect mail. Rare thus; an unusual stampless endorsement from an Anti-Slaver ship. Technically the 6d rate could have been doubled by the P.O., but the endorsement seems to have done the trick! Exhibition Item. PHOTO  	Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â£360

###History
Fernando Po is an island, 40 miles distant from the south-east coast of Nigeria.

The island was discovered by Fernando Po (1486) and named after him. The Portuguese found its development
difficult. Spain took over in 1778 and showed very little enterprise, although the baptists maintained mission
stations there.

###Abolition of Slavery

The importance of the island was raised with the abolition of slavery with the British anti-slavery squandron using it as a base.
A number of escaping slaves also made {{wi:Fernando_Po}} their refuge.

Until a firm foothold by the British was established in the Nigerias, the island was the center of British activity
in the area for many years.

###Postal History
Letters are known, without local handstruck stamps, from as early as 1840. From 1845 for a number of years the Baptist
Mission had a mail boat the 'dove' which plied between the island and Oil Rivers. 

The Baptist Mission and the sheltering slaves were expellled from the island in 1858 and sought refuge in
the Camerouns. the resident Consul was appointed British Post Office Agent in 1859, the year of the registration
of the first __PAID__ handstamp (see also Lagos).

From 1860 British adhesives could be used.

Prior to 1860, letters with British adhesives from the African naval stations, were cancelled on arrival in London. Between 1858 and 1870 the mail boat
marks (B12, B56) of the African run are found as cancellers on current 1d., 6d., and 10d. stamps. These numbers
were allotted elsewhere in 1870. Letters from the French Colony of gabon also passed through
the island office.

For a few years (1866-69) the Consulate at Lakoja came under that of Fernando Po. the latter was at Old Calabar from
1871 to 1873 and next year we find in use both the framed __PAID__ stamp and also the __247__ canceller. Covers showing the latter
on British adhesives are very rare. In 1877, the Post Office Agency on the island was closed, although the Consulate remained until 1882.
