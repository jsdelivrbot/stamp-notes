In 1918 Bosnia and Herzegovina was merged in the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians. Overprints (DRZAVA S.H.S. etc.) were first used in 1919.[2] The name of Kingdom of Yugoslavia appeared only in 1931. The region used Yugoslavian stamps until becoming (again) independent in 1992.
