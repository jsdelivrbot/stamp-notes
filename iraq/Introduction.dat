After long months of strenuous fighting, Baghdad was at last
entered by the British forces under General Maude on march 11th, 1917.
In the City of the Caliphs, with its teeming populace
and widespread commercial interests, the need for a public postal service was an absolute necessity. The then Civil Administration decided that the Indian postal agency should be
re-established for the handling of civilian mail. A supply of Indian postage
stamps was at the same time requisitioned.

Three operations appear to have been employed in the overprinting
of each and every stamp of the series, one for the vertical
overprint, a second for the word __BAGHADA__ and a third for the value. This afct combined
with the varying sizes of the stamps to be overprinted, which consisted for the most part of single
copies or small fragments of sheets only, and the entire absence of any up-to-date
printing plant, rendered the works of overprinting, slow and laborious,
and variations in type and setting, both major and minor. Certain of the stamps
also bore Arabic overprints applied by the postal authorities, notably
those impressed with the device of a Star and Cresent, on
which a native inscription indicating that they were
sold for the benefit of widows and orphans of fallen soldiers had first to be obliterated with a solid
Cresent in violet-brown ink, prior to the re-issue in teh British Occupation series.

Despite all these difficultie sthe stamps were duly placed on sale to officers and men
of the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force in the city of the Arabian Nights on September 1st, 1917, the sale being strictly
limited to eight specimens to each appliacant.

Th most notable varieties of these series are the 1 anna on paras red pictoraial with the word __occupation__ omitted,
the 1/2 anna on thegrey-green (War Relief)  10 paras with error __BAGHCAD__ for __BAGHDAD__.
Two varieties of the word __Occupation__, large and small , may likewise be differentiated, and minor varieties too numerous to mention
resulting from the primitive printing facilities.
