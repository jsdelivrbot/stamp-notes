###British Occupation Issue - Unissued Stamps
When the overprinting was carried out it was realised that some of the stamps existed in very small numbers and therefore it was decided not to issue them. Most of these stamps ended up in three major collections namely the Royal, the Marquis of Bute and the Major White collections. Copies of all unissued stamps are shown.

These found their way into the British Royal Collection and the Marquess of Bute collection. They were
offered for sale again in 2003 by Spink Shreves and remain now in private hands. They are exceedingly rare with only
a few copies known.

Freddy Khalastchy, a Fellow of the Royal Philatelic Society London, who has built up the world's finest collection of the stamps of Iraq, was born and brought up in Baghdad during the late 1950s and experienced at first-hand the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein. 
In March 2008 his collection was exhibited at the Royal Philatelic Society.

John Crichton-Stuart

4th Marquess Of Bute (1881 - 1947)

John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute, shared his father's enthusiasm for architecture. Amongst his restoration projects were Caerphilly Castle in Wales and Robert Adam's north side of Charlotte Square in Edinburgh. An avid collector, he built up important collections of art, silver, money, stamps and furniture. He developed a particular interest in the history and culture of Morocco, where he became the largest foreign landowner. At Tangier, he also established the famous El Minzah Hotel and became proprietor of the English language newspaper, The Tangier Gazette. In 1938 he presided over the sale of the bulk of his Cardiff properties in a deal which caused a sensation in the national press at the time}
