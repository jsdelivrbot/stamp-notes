1917 1/4a on 4pa Sepia Column of Constantine, an extremely rare unused example of an unissued value, which is not listed in either Stanley Gibbons or Scott, fresh with rich color and well centered, very faint horizontal crease, otherwise extremely fine; it is believed that this and other values which follow were not issued because too small a number were made, only a very few of each of these values (usually two blocks of four) were saved and the rest were mutilated so as to be neither usable or collectable, this is the 2nd stamp in a horizontal strip of four from the Bute collection, being the only four stamps in private hands, plus a horizontal pair in the Royal collection; a major rarity; signed Joe Saatchi and accompanied by clear 1961 BPA certificate; ex-Bute.
