\chapter{Namimbia}

Namibia, formerly known as [South-West Africa](../SWA/introduction) and German South-West Africa, has a rich history of postal services, starting from postal runners delivering messages among mission stations. The first stamps were printed during the German colonial period. Currently NamPost is responsible for running postal services, managing 135 postal offices in the country.



\section{Pre-colonial period}

The first postal services in Namibia (then known as South-West Africa) started in 1814 with the deployment of messengers facilitating communication between the early mission stations at Warmbad and Bethanie and later to Keetmanshoop and Gross Barmen. This service was expanded in 1846, connecting the South-West African mission stations to those in South Africa. [1]

Main article: Postage stamps and postal history of German South-West Africa
The first post office of South-West Africa was founded in Otjimbingwe in 1888, further offices were established in Windhoek (1891) and Swakopmund (1895).[1]

South African period






During World War II, small economy stamps were used in SWA.


Stamps of South Africa overprinted for use in SWA 1947. The stamps show Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret and commemorated the visit of the British royal family to Africa.
The story of the South African period starts with the South African Armed Forces' defeat of the Imperial German Army in the colony of German South West Africa in 1915. After the South African victory, South African stamps were used in SWA in a period that has been categorised as the forerunners period (1914-1923).

[edit]Overprints

In 1922, following a League of Nations mandate, South Africa was awarded the responsibility to administer the colony. Between 1923 and 1952 South African stamps were overprinted with South West Africa and Zuid West Africa or simply SWA. Stamps inscribed South West Africa and Suides-Afrika were also issued.[2]
After World War II the Mandate was supposed to become a United Nations Trust Territory, but South Africa objected to South West Africa coming under U.N. control. It refused to allow the territory's transition to independence, regarding it as a fifth province.[3]

[edit]Last stamps of South West Africa
In 1989 the last stamps of South West Africa were a set of 15 depicting minerals and mining. The stamps were unusual in that only a short while after their issue the illegal Republic of South West Africa was declared independent, becoming Namibia. As the stamps were new, most of the designs were kept with only the name changed (cuprite was dropped and willemite added for the Namibian issue). Another problem was that one of the stamps, for boltwoodite, had an error in its chemical equation. This was corrected in the Namibian issue.[4]


Independent Namibia

Namibia has issued regular definitive and commemorative stamps since independence.
NamPost is the company responsible for postal servicein Namibia. It currently has 743 employees in 135 post offices, and reserves of 2.51 million N. CEO of NamPost is Festus Hangula.[1]
