# Chile

LET us first consider Chile's record from the Postal History angle. The first mention of a
postal service of a kind is in April 1766 when a certain Don Francis Lopez made a claim
for 388 pesos which he said he had expended in the 'carriage of mail'.
In 1778, a book called Royal Ordinances and Regulations was published in Lima, (Peru)
dealing with the postal systems of Chile and Peru. Later we find instructions that letters
would be marked 'Franca' with the name of the town from which sent, with the amount to
be 'paid' or 'collected' written in manuscript.

As will be seen from my first exhibit, the sending of a letter was a very expensive businessin those days. This letter Santiago to London was 1/2 ozs. in weight, and charged at 8s. 8d. per ounce, cost 10s. l0d. It is dated 21st January, 1832, is stamped in red 'Franca' withSantiago in Oval in red.

Another cover shows 'Portsmouth Ship Letter' (1839), and also circular handstamps both
of Valparaiso 'Paid' and also Valparaiso 'Unpaid

\section{Adhesive Stamps}
###The Colon Issue

In 1852 Chile decided to issue postage stamps, of the value of 5 centavos and lOcentavos,
and selected the 1d. red and 2d. blue of Britain as its pattern. The order being duly despatched
to Messrs Perkins, Bacon and Fetch, with instructions to produce a similar pair
of stamps but using the head of Cristobal Colon (Christopher Columbus), incorporating
the words 'Colon' above and 'Chile' below, with 'Correos Porte Franco' at the extreme top,
and the value at the foot. These instructions were carried out to the Letter and as the British
stamps had 240 to the sheet so it was that the Chilean issue was also set out with the same
number (how a country on decimal coinage coped with 240 on a sheet in their financial
records we do not know). In addition, the format of the stamps being larger than the 1d.
red British it was necessary to place the Chilean Stamps so close together in the cliches that
it must have been a difficult task to get the blade of the scissors between impressions.
This was unlike their neighbours Brazil, whose famous 'Bull's Eyes' had comparatively
colossal margins - a fact which is sometimes overlooked when these issues are shown in
competition. The search for 'four margin copies' whilst difficult, is not impossible, and after fifty years of collecting these issues I am at least able to show about 90\percent with 'complete' margins.

The first issue of 299,760 of the 5 centavos, and 200,160 of the 10 centavos was duly
despatched to Chile together with 200 reams of water marked paper, and the plates. The
postal service became very popular right away and the five centavos stamps were soon in
short supply. This caused the authorities to send the plates, together with 'a quantity' of
paper to Senor N. Desmadryl who made a printing in January, 1854. He also made two
further printings believed to be in August and September - (in fact one cover shown proves
the third printing to have been in September), but some time between these dates the plates
were sent, (with a supply of paper) to a printer named Gillet. He produced a printing, or
more than one, in various shades in an endeavour to match the colour, but as he was dissatisfied
with his work, he being a lithographic printer too, decided on his own initiative
to transfer the design to the stone and lithographed a printing - here again are several
shades. That he had done this was not discovered until 1898 when a collector wrote to
a friend in New York saying he had found an 'impossible' variety in the 5 centavos Chile -
'the figure 5 is hopelessly squeezed up'.

Upon enquiry it was found that Gillet had really lithographed an issue and then the
'hunt was on' to find transfer varieties * First Edward Denny Bacon discovered about
twenty-four transfer flaws, followed by Stanley Philips who found about another twelve -
the total is now over eighty - (vide article by the author - Philatelic Journal of Great
Britain March-May, 1957), since writing this I have been able to add two more to the list.
About nine of these transfer varieties are shown in my display - three in a strip of three,
which is unfortunately badly cut into, but the other six showing 'Top of Porte cut off',
'Narrow O in porte' 'Inset corners' etc are from the collection of the late H. C. V. Adams,
F.R.P.S.L.
As the supply of the 5 centavos stamps was nearly always very low the Chilean Government
authorised the bisecting of the 10 centavos. These are nearly always found bisected
diagonally, but on occasion 'vertical' or 'horizontal'. The order was later rescinded but the
custom prevailed and was condoned to such an extent that almost all printings of the 10
centavos can be found bisected.

During this period a further plate had been ordered from London and a printing of the
5 centavos was sent out to Chile, again with a supply of watermarked paper, but this time
the watermark figure 5 had a straight neck instead of one sloping. The plate however had
been prepared in a hurry and the cliches were badly aligned. In addition the steel was much
softer and showed considerable early wear.

When the printings were eventually prepared by the Chilean Post Office, both plates
were used but Plate 2 was used first, hence the early printings sometimes show a greater
degree of wear than the later, when plate 1 was used.

It should be here mentioned that the 10 centavos plate had been sent to Senor Desmadryl
and his printing of this value was very fine workmanship indeed. Mint specimens are
extremely rare, and I am only able to show one (the deep blue). Pairs and strips are not
plentiful because in the early days, the postal clerks frequently cut the sheets of stamps into
singles to ensure greater speed of service. I am able to show a superb vertical strip of five,
which is unusual.

At one time it was thought that Gillet had also printed the 10 centavos but it has been
definitely established in recent years that he did not.

The 'Post Office Printings' made under the guidance and direction of the technicians of
Macdonald and Co. of London, who supplied the machinery, were quite good efforts.
There are, however, several shades dull reddish brown to carmine red, and one very fine
example of the item 'printed on both sides' is shown.

The 10 centavos also produced by the Chilean Post Office provided several shades ranging
from Indigo to Greenish Blue. The mint copies shown of the indigo, the deep blue and the
strip of five of the deep bright blue are all from the Adams collection. A cover showing
bisect dated 'Chilian, 28 January, I860' (the date is in manuscript), was exhibited by Mr
Robson Lowe, at the London International Exhibition, under the title of 'One hundred
years'.

The 1 centavo yellow is not an easy stamp to find in good condition, its colour militating
against it - many 1 centavos stamps are found fiscally cancelled with the ink marking
cleaned off and a postmark substituted.

In 1861 Perkins Bacon made a new 10 centavos plate and printed a supply and it is
in this issue that we find the rarest stamp of Chile. One sheet with the watermark '20' did
inadvertently get into the machine and was printed 10 centavos. This firm were so meticulously
careful, that it was doubted for some time if this item was genuine - of the four copies
known all have watermark 'inverted and reversed'. The one shown was in the R. B.
Yardley collection for many years and has a 'Royal' Certificate. Another item the 'Narrow
watermark 10' was in the collection of H. C. V. Adams. This plate had one or two stamps
re-touched under the word 'Correos' - the original lozenge design being expunged and a
series of dots inserted. This is shown on the 7th stamp of the block of nine, and there are a
few single copies.

'Combination covers' of the 5 and 10, or the 10 and 20 centavos are somewhat uncommon.
Some examples are shown.

The 20 centavos printed by Perkins, Bacon & Co. is one of the nicest looking of the
imperfs. There are several shades including the rare 'so called Emerald Green'. I say socalled
because whilst this shade is described as 'Emerald' it is frequently debated that it is
not a true emerald shade. However, the item shown came from the Baron Welczek Collection
and is one of the best examples known. There is also a beautiful vertical pair of the
deep green.

The Post Office Printings of 1865-66, watermarked 'Large figure 5' are in many cases
poorly produced. The British technicians having returned home and the Post Office left
to its own devices made the work leave a lot to be desired. There are several mint and used items shown, one being the unused copy of the 'double print' (ex the Albert Quast collection which was described by the auctioneers in their catalogue as an 'outstanding and extremely scarce item'. A copy of the 'printed both sides' is also shown and several with 'paper folds' as this issue was often printed on thin paper.

Some mention should be made here of the notorious Hugo Hahn reprints. A German of
this name by some means obtained the plate of the 20 centavos value and got permission
to print:

400 sheets in yellow, surcharged 1 peso in black
200 sheets in red „ 5 pesos in blue
40 sheets in blue „ 10 pesos in carmine
4 sheets in green „ 20 pesos in violet

The work was to be done in the presence of a treasury official who was to see that all proofs
and spoiled sheets were destroyed. The stamps were to be on issue commemorating the
Centenary of Independence of Chile, and Hahn was to bear the cost of production on
condition that he might retain two sheets of each value for himself and have the right of
purchasing 20,000 pesos worth over the Post Office counter. Fortunately the daily papers
raised such an outcry that the scheme was abandoned. Hahn did however have some
sheets printed in various colours by Helpmann, the Universal Printing Office, Valparaiso,
and some others were produced by lithography. They were produced on paper watermarked
with a 'star' and some were on unwatermarked paper. Both styles are shown in singles and
in blocks of four.

The first change in the Printers came about at the end of 1866, when a Mr A. G. Goodall,
of the American Bank Note Company came to the South American Continent. He must
have been a first class commercial traveller because he succeeded in obtaining orders from
most of the Ibero-American countries. His price to Chile was the equivalent of £7 per 100,000
stamps, and the order given to him was:

1 centavo 2,250,000 10 centavos 4,500,000

2 centavos 2,250,000 20 centavos 1,000,000

5 centavos 5,500,000

printed in sheets of 100 stamps (ten rows often). Cork type cancellers were supplied with the stamps, and that is why it is possible to find other countries with the same type of cancel as these were supplied by the A.B.N. Co. too. Plate proofs on paper and on card, as well as colour trials are shown, the latter being on China paper. The perforation gauged 12. The
5 centavos was re-issued during the Chile-Bolivia-Peru War and can only be distinguished
by the postmark. Two copies are here shown.

1877 saw perforations disappear once again and stamps were issued 'rouletted'. Apart
from the variety of shade the study of this issue is interesting, particularly in the discovery
of the 'Estafeta' marks. A law had been passed to include the date in the hand-stamp but
owing to the expense involved, this was only carried out in the larger offices. The smaller
offices were supplied with a stamp canceller with the name of the place at the top of the
circle and 'Chile' at the bottom with the letters 'EST' in the centre, an abbreviation of
'Estafeta' (Local Post Office). There are many different sizes and styles of the letters EST,
and it is sometimes possible to determine an indistinct postmark by knowing the style of the
fount of type showing the letters EST. Several examples are shown, in particular two covers
from San Antonio Puerto de las Bodegas, shown cancelled in red and the exact counterpart
cancelled in black.

Some years ago my friend Harry Porter of Australia wrote an article in THE LONDON
PHILATELIST Nos 762-763 on these issues and he said that in all his years of searching he had
only found about half of the known 'Estafeta' examples. I show about the same number
here, but I know that both of us had examples which the other did not have, but when his
collection was sold in London, the tracings were included but 1 was informed that the
stamps had not been received from Australia. Whether they are reposing in someone's collection in that continent or have been mislaid, no one seems to know, but no step can
be made towards a complete listing until these items turn up for comparison with my own.
In 1880 Chile joined the Postal Union and the issue of 1877 was re-designed and the 15,
20 and 30 centavos were added to the series. The value of 1 peso was added to the set in
1891. In 1894 the 1 centavo and the 2 centavos were re-engraved and the scrolls on each side
of the figures were removed.
In 1899 a new design was ordered from the American Bank Note Co. but the order was
later countermanded and the order given to Senor Carlos Rogers (Agent for Messrs
Waterlow & Sons, London). This firm prepared the issue 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 centavos.
There are few shades but in later printing the shading above the head of Columbus was
removed. There are however, many marked re-entries which exist in the 10, 20 and 50
centavos nearly all concerned with the word 'Chile'.

Owing to a shortage of the 5 centavos stamp in 1900, 11/2 millions of the 30 centavos stamp
were surcharged with a large figure '5' in black. The work was very hurried and 'inverted'
'double' 'double inverted' and 'sideways' are shown. Forgeries of the rarer varieties were
made but are easily detected - the figure 5 being smaller.

Tenders were requested for another new issue and that of the American Bank Note Co.,
being the lowest, was accepted and a smaller format stamp designed by H. C. Aries was
adopted, with the values 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 50 centavos. There are several shades but nothing
out of the ordinary in varieties. The perforation is 12.

The 10 centavos stamp of the Waterlow issue having become exhausted before a printing
could be received from the American Bank Note Co. it was necessary to surcharge the 30
centavos in words 'Diez Centavos'. This work was done by Barros and Barcello, of Santiago,
and the stone was built up from two types, easily distinguished by the shape of the letter
'C' and the 'Top of the T' in Centavos, one T having a straight top and the other a sloping
top.

In 1904 further provisionals were issued, mainly in order to use up the large stocks of
Telegraph Stamps which remained, as well as to fill a need for certain values. This work was
also done by the Barcelona Press of Barros and Barcello, and varieties are found with the
word 'Correos' with no centre bar to E (Stamps 16 and 59) also with the surcharge or overprint
'inverted' and misplaced, and in the 12 centavos on 5 centavos, with 'no star left of the
word centavos'.
The issue of 1905-9 marks the end of the struggle for the retention of the head of Columbus
on all stamps. This set was the last of such a series and shows the head of Columbus on
the 1, 2, 3 and 5 centavos taken from the 4 dollars 1892 issue of the U.S.A. The 10, 20, 15,
30 and 50 centavos show another type of head, whilst the 1 peso is obviously copied from the
5 dollars 1892, U.S.A.

In 1910 four stamps of this issue were overprinted or surcharged for Islas de Juan Fernandez
(Robinson Crusoe Island) but were authorised for use throughout Chile.

The Centenary of Independence Commemoration of 1910 stamps prepared by the
American Bank Note Co. are a fine example of Engraving and Printing. The first printing
was on White Paper whilst the subsequent printings were on Greyish (Safety) Paper. It is
interesting to note that Admiral Cochrane depicted on the 10 pesos was the great uncle of
William J. Cochrane, F.S.I., R.D.P., F.R.P.S.L., who was my philatelic guide and instructor in my younger days of stamp collecting.

Sheet number 84 shows several essays and three examples of the 'Dollard' essay. Wilfred
Haworth borrowed these examples to illustrate an article in the Philatelic Journal of Great
Britain, wherein he referred to an endeavour to trace the reason for these. He discovered
that the Chilean authorities never gave any permission for this design to be copied and I am
informed that Messrs Dollard had in all probability produced these proofs as a 'sample of
work which they were able to do' when endeavouring to obtain the contract for the Stamps
of Eire, and to show their skill and ability as stamp printers. Why the Valdivia design of
Chile was chosen with the name and value erased is not known.
The definitive issue of 1911 with variations in methods of printing, and a light variation
in design was in use for almost seventeen years. Some of these values, the 10, 15 and 20
centavos are known with head inverted. The 10 and the 20 are shown. Of the 15 centavos -
up to the present only three of this value are known thus.
The 1916-25 printing shows the 10 centavos (O'Higgins) with inverted head. This inverted
head is always very much off-centre as will be noticed in the example displayed. A scarce
variety shown is that with the frame printed on both sides. 1918 shows the 4 centavos with
inverted head and the frame only doubly printed. The 4 centavos (Balmaceda) was prepared
for use, but was never gummed and not issued, and this is shown with two copies of the
unissued M. de Salas also prepared but not issued. When examining the last item, this is not
surprising as a better reproduction of a totally inebriated person could scarcely be imagined.
The first air flight (not catalogued by Gibbons), that of Clodoimro Figueroa is shown as
well as the proof and the used set of the Luis Testart Air Service between Santiago and
Valparaiso, commenced on 3rd May, 1927, and ended March 1928. (This set has only in
recent years been included in Stanley Gibbons listing).
The Pan American Congress was commemorated by a set of eight stamps showing the
Congress Building and as Air Service was of vital importance to a country situated such as
Chile, we find the overprinting of the Postal Issue with 'Correo Aereo' and the 'Flying Condor'
used frequently. In some of the values the inscription at the head was changed from
'Chile Correos' to 'Correos de Chile'. All the varieties in these issues are shown including a
used pair of the 10 pesos printed in blue instead of black, and a mint copy of the same, as
well as the genuine and forged surcharges.
The Graf Zeppelin made a trip from Frederickshaven to Conception and back, and a
cover of this flight is shown together with another item on piece. The flight by the plane the
Manu-Tara (Bird of Good Luck) to Easter Island in an endeavour to plan a flight service
to Australia ended in disaster, as the plane crashed into the sea on the return journey. The
100 covers carried were salvaged by a Chilean gunboat and returned to the Chilean mainland.
Some covers survived in good condition - the copy shown is one of three known to
exist outside America.

The later issues, Air Mail, Postal, Commemoration stamps etc. need little comment
except that a great variety of shades, damaged letters in design and similar marks exist, - a
comprehensive list of these is given in the Catalogue Socopo published in Chile. Where
these varieties are found they have been noted and included in the display, as are some items
which are not catalogued, such as items found imperf. Proof sheets of all the latter issues are
included, some of which are signed by the engraver, Jose Moreno, and of which very few
exist. The forgery of the 50 centavos Air Stamp is shown in two shades, together with two
forged copies used on piece with genuine stamps. The main point of difference apart from
the fact that the forgery is lithographed is:

1. The imprint is closer to the design in the genuine.

2. There is a comma after Santiago in the genuine, but not in the forgery.

The Claude Gay 'Flora and Fauna' issue of 1948 wherein twenty-five designs appeared
on each pane, is represented by the proof showing '40 Centavos' (not issued in such a value), but complete mint panes, and re-constructed used panes are shown in each of the values

issued, 60 centavos, 3 pesos and 5 pesos. Many of the issues around this period are shown in
complete panes of twenty-five stamps, one of these (Vicuna McKenna, 1949) shows one of
the stamps out of alignment in the cliches.
Miniature sheets are shown in all cases where they have been issued - one of the scarcest
of these being the recent 'World Refugee Year' of 1960.
The issues of the past few years are acquired as they come to hand and anything of an
unusual nature is included. There is a collection of over 1,000 postmarks of various towns
and villages in Chile mainly around the period 1880 to 1890 showing the various sizes
and types of cancel. There is also a large collection ot mint and used postal stationery,
postage dues, Telegraph Stamps used for postage, Acknowledgement of receipt stamps,
Ministry of Marine and Official Stamps, in fact anything in any way connected with the
postal history of Chile has been included.

\section{British Stamps Used in Chile}

A representative selection of these items is shown - one cover being particularly interesting
in the C30 (Valparaiso) group. Gibbons commence their listing with the Id. Plate No. 85
but one is shown used on cover with the Plate Number 80. From the date of the cancel it
would appear that this copy of plate 80 must have been carried to Chile, probably in the
sender's pocket book, or acquired from some other source, and used on this letter, as plate
80 was never 'officially' sent to Chile.

A few examples used from CALDERA (C 37) are also shown, as well as a few items from
COQUIMBO (C 40). In this last there is a copy of the 5s. rose Plate 1 of which it is stated
that only three other copies have been recorded. That this item is so rare, one cannot believe
and I feel sure there must be other copies reposing in collections throughout the world.
THE CHILE-BOLIVIA-PERU WAR
This collection, consisting of over two volumes, is probably the most comprehensive existing
to date. It was commenced about twenty-five years ago and has had added to it, many items
from the George Herbert Dannatt collection, some from the collection of Wilfred Haworth;
the whole of the 'Bolivian' section from the Adams collection, and several items from the
Harry Porter collection.

The 'Fancy' type 'Franca' and the oval type 'Antofagasta' 'Cancellado', are shown, and
an attempt has been made to trace the progress of the Chileans through Bolivia right up to
the Islands of Lobos de Afuera just off the northern extremity of Peru. One of the 'Huacho'
items is that illustrated in Haworth's book on Chile, and the 1 centavos on piece 'Lobos de
Afuera' is illustrated both in Haworth's book and also in the Moll Catalogue of Peru.
The 10 centavos with the world 'Chile' in the centre is shown but it is only listed in Moll
Catalogue of Peru. The 10 centavos with the word 'Chile' in the centre is shown but it is
only listed in 'Moll' without the word.

Examples are shown of the various types of canceller in use at Iquique, Antofagasta, Lima,
Callao, Pisagua, La Noria, Poso del Monte, Tocopilla, Tacna, Mollendo, Yea, Eten,
Carmen Alto, Mejillones, Arica, Paita, together with soliders 'Free' letters and captured
Postal Stationery overprinted with the Chilean Arms. 'A' and 'F' and 'Mute' marks are
also included and where possible cancellations on Peru stamps have been acquired to assist
in the search for any Chilean items which may exist with the same cancel. See Article 'Stamp Collecting' 1963.
