{{dfn:7b 5c Deep Red Brown}}
<img src="http://localhost/egypt/chile/108.jpg" style="width:98%" />
<p style="font-size:smaller"> 
1854, 5c Deep Red Brown, Lithograph (7b). Unused (no gum), large margins, intense shade and impression on bright fresh paper

EXTREMELY FINE GEM. ONE OF THE FINEST UNUSED EXAMPLES OF THE 5-CENTAVOS LITHOGRAPH WE HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED, POSSESSING AN EXTRAORDINARY DEPTH OF COLOR AND IMPRESSION FOR A LITHOGRAPHED ISSUE.

Looking at this stamp, it is easy to understand how Gillet was able to use lithography without anyone noticing. The government objected to the use of lithography and never authorized it, but the stamps were so expertly printed, apparently no one noticed until nearly fifty years later when stamp collectors identified the lithographed stamps.

<p style="font-size:smaller"> 
1854, 5c Chocolate Brown, Lithograph (7d). Unused (no gum), ample margins to clear at bottom right, intense color in the true Chocolate Brown shade (arguably Deep Chocolate Brown), proof-like impression which gives every appearance of a recess-printed stamp

VERY FINE. THE ONLY RECORDED UNUSED EXAMPLE OF THE 5-CENTAVOS LITHOGRAPH IN THE CHOCOLATE BROWN SHADE. A TRULY SPECTACULAR EXAMPLE OF THIS RARE "COLON" ISSUE.
