\chapter{1937 Definitives (Third Definitives Set)}
The accepted design for this issue was submitted by Messrs Waterlow and Sons of London, and was according to Smith acclaimed in teh philatelic press of the day.

The original design submitted by the printers was accepted by the Postamster General, Mr. C.J. Swift, with the only comment to substitute the words `Postage and Revenue` at the base of teh stamp instead of `Postage Issue` and the Crown, which had been included, was eliminated. The columns on either side were broken in the centre to have teh value printed in the intervening space.
