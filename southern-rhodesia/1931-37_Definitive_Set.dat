\chapter{1931-37 Definitive Set}

The 'Admiral' set which remained in use since 1923 came to an end, when it was replaced by a definitive set consisting of 15 values on 1st April, 1931. All the stamps with the exception of the 2d. and 3d. values, depicted the effigy of King George V.

The 2d. and 3d. stamps were printed by typography and depicted a picture of the Victoria Falls. These two stamps received considerable criticism, and arrangements were made for them to be replaced by a larger design, similar to the 1905 issue, which had been extremely popular.
