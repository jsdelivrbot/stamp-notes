After the War, there were serious manpower shortages, and this resulted in the Colonial territories not having any commemorative issues released. In reply to a question in Parliament, the British Secretary for the Colonies, said the manpower and manufacturing position would not permit of the necessary diversion of labour and materials.

The planned date of the issue was the 1st January 1947, but the delivery of the stamps was delayed owing to the manufacturing difficulties in Britain. The stamps were finally released on the 8th May 1947, and were withdrawn on 8th November, 1947.


Plate proofs with security punch exist.
