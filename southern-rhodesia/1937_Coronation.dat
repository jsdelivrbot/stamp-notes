\chapter{1937 Coronation}

Southern Rhodesia joined the numerous {{wi:British Colonies}} to issue a set of four stamps bearing the effigies of King George VI and the Queen on either side of a central view of teh Victoria Falls, with a train passing over the Falls bridge in the foreground. The Rhodesiam design was typical of teh country and differed greatly from those issued by the Dominions and the Colonies. The stamps were issued on 12 May, 1937, and withdrawn on 31st August, 1937 according to a Post Office Notice (P.N. 17/1937).

The values approved were 1d., 2d., 3d., and 6d. The stamps were produced by Waterlow and Sons using the recess printing process. The artwork and the designs were produced by Waterlow as there was no time to have these done in Rhodesia.

The stamp order entailed the design and engraving of original dies, preparation of teh 4-value casement dies, five 60-set casement printing paltes and a set of Vignette Plates.

The proofs and essays were presented to the the King for the inclusion in the Royal Collection.

There was a great demand for the stamps with the 3d. value having been sold within a few days at the laregr offices. Smith write that the \textit{Rhodesia Herald} reported ques of up to a quarter mile long at the Salisbury Post Office. Stocks were recalled from the smaller post office but soon a black market developed in the 3d. stamps and they were offered up to \pound2 each. An attempt was also made to corner the 6d. stamp and a person in Bulawayo offered to buy the remaining stocks. 

The Postmaster-General took measures to limit sales of the 6d. stamp to 10 per person per day.
