It´s known columns seven (from the left) and nine were affected, but not if the columns came from the same sheet or two different ones. Columns six and ten show partial omission of the colour, but column eight hasn´t been seen making it impossible to know with certainty if one or two sheets were affected. What is known with certainty is that one other sheet was affected completely on columns six and seven and partially on the columns either side quantity: circa 24 mint Sold for £4,000.00.
