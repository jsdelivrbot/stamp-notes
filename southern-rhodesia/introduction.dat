\chapter{Southern Rhodesia}  

Southern Rhodesia was the name of the self-governing British colony north of the Limpopo River and the Union of South Africa. After its Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, it was known as simply Rhodesia until 1979, when it reconstituted itself under majority rule as the unrecognised state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia. It reverted to colonial status in December 1979, and it became the recognised state of Zimbabwe in April 1980.


The design of the stamps was substantially the same as the preceding issue, the words `Postage and Revenue' substituted for `British South Africa Company` and `Southern Rhodesia` for `Rhodesia`.
