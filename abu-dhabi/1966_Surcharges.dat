# 1966 Surcharges

When the then Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Shakhbut bin Zaid al Nuhayyan succeeded his uncle the expectation that he would last long was not there. His uncle whom he succeeded was assasinated as well as three others of his predecessors. Sheikh Shakhbut succeeded his uncle Sheikh Saqr I bin Zayed Al Nahyan in 1928, becoming the ruler of the emirate of Abu Dhabi. During his reign, he adopted an aggressively mercantilist strategy, keeping his reserves in gold. His reign lasted until 6 August 1966 when he was deposed in a bloodless coup by the British-led Trucial Oman Scouts to the benefit of his brother Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.

The discovery of oil in 1958, and the start of oil exports in 1962, led to frustration among members of the ruling family about the lack of progress under Sheikh Shakhbut’s rule.[13] On 6 August 1966, Shakhbut was deposed in a bloodless palace coup.[14] Although it is not entirely clear from the historical record, the coup appeared to have the full backing of the Al Nahyan family and the support of the British, with the Trucial Oman Scouts providing safe transport for Sheikh Shakbut out of Abu Dhabi.

Following the deposition of Sheikh bin Zaid al Nuhayyan, the 1964 definitives were withdrawn from sale and re-issued on October 1st, with Shaikh Shakhbut's portrait defaced by three or four horizontal bars. The opportunity was also taken to surcharge the stamps with the new currency which had been recently adopted in place of the Indian External Rupee. The overprinting and surcharging was carried out by the Arabian Printing and Publishing House and, considering as Donaldson put's it: "that this was a type of work in which they had no previous experience, they made quite a good job of it."

Despite the good printing some errors escaped and these are described and plated in Donaldson.

The quantities issued are also given in the above publication. The high value 1Dinar is especially elusive as only 3,000 were sold out of 30,000 issued. Thirty thousand Airogrammes were also issued.

All remainders when the new definitives were issued on April 1st, 1967, were held at the Philatelic Bureau until November and then destroyed.
