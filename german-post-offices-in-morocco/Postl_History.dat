1906-11 1p. on 80pf. black and carmine on rose, tied by "tanger (marocco) deutsche post" c.d.s. of 5 April 1911 to insured letter from the stamp dealer M.A. Levy in Tangier to August Katz in Wilmersdorf Berlin; a little roughly opened but with five intact seals on the reverse, fine. Dr. Karl Pauligk certificate (2003) in which he states that, although the cover is slightly over-franked, this is irrelevant in relation to the extreme rarity of this stamp on a commercial cover. S.G. 47, Michel 42. Photo
Estimate £ 2,000-2,500
