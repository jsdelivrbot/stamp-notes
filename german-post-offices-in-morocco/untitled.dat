#The Fifth Issue.


In 1911, some officious individual discovered
that the spelling "Marocco" on
these stamps was hardly correct, consequently,
an entirely new set had to be
issued with the surcharge Germanised
to "Marokko". With the exception of
this alteration of the two letters "c" to
"k", the type and arrangement on the
various values is the same as before.
All values are on the lozenge watermarked
paper.
