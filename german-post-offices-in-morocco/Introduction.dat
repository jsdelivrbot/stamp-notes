<p style="font-size:smaller"> 
Michel #VII, 1905 10c on 10pf Carmine rose, 
the unissued value with the gothic surcharge of 1905 
but on the earlier 10pf "Reichspost" stamp, rather than the later 
"Deutsches Reich" issue, a pristine gem example, being perfectly centered 
and possessing phenomenal freshness, with bright colors on brilliant white paper, 
flawless o.g., never hinged, extremely fine and remarkably choice; 
only one sheet of this stamp was printed, which was broken and auctioned 
by the Postal Administration in 1922; a great rarity of the 
German Offices in Morocco and even less are available in this 
terrific never hinged condition; 1983 Hans Bothe BPP certificate. (Image) 	€3,400

SOLD for $1,500.00

The German post offices abroad were a network of post offices in foreign countries established by Germany to provide mail service where the local services were deemed unsafe or unreliable. They were generally set up in cities with some sort of German commercial interest. They started appearing in the late 19th century and reached their heyday at the beginning of the 20th century; they closed down during or shortly after World War I.

It was not unusual for countries to maintain such offices in other countries; countries with similar offices abroad include Austria-Hungary, China, France, Greece, Italy, Romania, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the latter part of 19th century and into the 20th century, having extraterritorial post offices was one indication of a nation's international power.[1]

Stamps from German post offices abroad are popular with collectors and some are quite valuable. 
The highest price paid for a single stamp has been for the 40 
Pfennig Germania hand-stamped "China" (Tientsin issue) from 1900 
that realized 100,152 Euros at a 2006 auction.[2]


German post offices in Morocco (German: Deutsche Post in Marokko) started to operate in 1899. 
German definitive stamps were used with overprints; 
after the first issue the valuta was changed to pesetas and centimos. 
German post offices closed in French-controlled Morocco in 1914, and 
in Spanish-controlled Morocco on June 16, 1919.):[6]
