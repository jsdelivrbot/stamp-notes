# Stamps and Postal History of German Post Offices in Morocco

Until 1890 German postal business in Morocco was conducted through the French offices but from that year until German postal agencies were opened German subjects resident in the coast towns were permitted to forward letters to Germany by the Wormann Steamship Line. Writing on this subject in Gibbons' Stamp Weekly in 1908 Dr. Otto
Rommel stated:

\begin{blockquote}
Ordinary German stamps were used,
and were postmarked on the boats in
black ink with the inscription "Aus
Westafrika" (from West Africa).
By the side of this postmark the name
of the particular town, e. g. Mogador
was written in ink. In all specialized
collections of the stamps of German
Morocco, it is only right that
these should be included. Unless the
name of the town is written in, one
cannot be sure that the stamp was
really used m Morocco, as the same
postmark was used, at any rate up to
1897, on letters posted in German
South-west Africa and the Cameroons.
\end{blockquote}

The first German post-offices in Morocco
were opened on December 30th,
1899, at Tangier (the chief office), Casablanca,
Laraiche, Mazagan, Mogador,
Rabat, and Saffi. On July 11th, 1900', an
office was opened at Marakesh; on May
27th 1901 offices were established at Alcazar
(Ksar-el-Kebir), Fez, and Meknes
(Mequinez) ; and on December 19th,
1906, an office was opened at Tetuan.

The German offices in Morocco were under the direction of the Chief Postal
Administration (Ober Postdirection) of Hamburg, and they were
served by a generously subsidised mail service; the latter consisting of two
sailings per month between Bremen and Hamburg, Casablance and Tangier,
and, by arrangement with Austria, of a monthly service between Trieste and Moroccan ports.
