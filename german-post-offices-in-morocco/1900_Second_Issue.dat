# 1900 Second Issue

On October 20, 1900, stamps of the
"Germania" type were suitably overprinted
for use in the Moroccan offices.

On the pfennig values, the overprint was applied horizontally in two lines, the
upper one consisting of the name and the lower one of the new value. On the
1, 2 and 5 mark denominations, the word "Marocco" reads upwards at the left
and downwards at the right, while the new value is applied horizontally between
and level with the base of the vertical overprints. On the 3 mark stamp, "Marocco" is shown reading upwards on the left border, while the new
value reads downwards at the right side.

The overprint is in red on the 3 mark and in black on all the others. It will
be noted the overprints are all so arranged that they do not cover the word
"REICHSPOST". Both types of the German 5 mark stamp were surcharged.

There were several printings of the surcharges
and Dr. Rommel refers to some
minor varieties of considerable interest
to the specialist, viz. :

\begin{blockquote}
In the last printing of these stamps,
a minor variety may be found; it has
not been decided satisfactorily if it
exists on some, or on all of the values.
By means of printers' trials, we have
been able to determine that in any
case, on the 25 centimes black, on 20pf
blue, the last printing of the overprint
is much lower down than usual, so
low, in fact, that the upper half of
the word REICHSPOST is covered.

At first, the overprint on the 3 to 50
pfennig had the letter "t" square at
the top and the letter "s" was straight
up. Toward the end of 1903 the 5
centimos showed slight signs of variation
in the overprint : the letter "t"
was thicker, and went off into a point
at the top. Other characteristics of
this second type of the 5c are that the
letter "s" leans sideways, the "c" in
"Marocco" and the figure "5" are
somewhat thicker. It appears that the
5c is the only value in which there
are two types. There are also differences
of type in the values from 1 to
5 marks, in which the differences all
lie in the word "Marocco". In type
I, the bottom serifs are long, and form
.right angles to the vertical strokes of
the letter "M"; the "r" and "o" are
fairly wide apart ; the word "Marocco"
is fairly Kghtly printed. In type II,
the bottom serifs of the "M" are
shorter, and form curves with -the
vertical strokes of the letter; the "r"
and "o" are closer together ; the word
"Marocco" appears to be more heavily
printed.
In 1905, a used specimen of the 50
centimos on 4C>pf was reported to have
been found with inverted "e" in "Centimos"
and, though the variety was
chronicled in many journals at the time,
I have been unable to learn anything
more about it.
