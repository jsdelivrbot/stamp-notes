\section{1888 Bisected}

The Royal Philatelic Society's work on West Indies says :—

\begin{letter}
"As no stamp of one cent was provided, the two cents value was cut
in half for the Inland Newspaper rate. The number of these half stamps
has no doubt been multiplied for the benefit of collectors ; still, the fact
remains that one cent stamps were really required for the postal service.
All varieties of the two cents are found divided and even to the present time
of writing (October, 1890) no one cent stamp has been issued."
\end{letter}

I may point out, in addition, that the newspaper rate to Australia, Cape,
China, Natal, etc., was 5 cents. This value could, I know, be supplied by a
combination of the 3 cents and 2 cents value, but the surcharging on the 3d.,
brown, was a very restricted one, and no doubt many split 2 cents were used
on these and also to make up the 3 cents rate when that value ran short.
The observation as to their use for the benefit of collectors is also true—
I have myself seen a number of these used upon one cover quite early in January,
1888, of half 2 cents on 6d. in conjunction with other stamps to make up a 60
or 70 cent rate, I forget which.

All the early bisected stamps which I have seen of the 2 cents (no other
value was officially sanctioned)—I am now referring to the locally surcharged
series, including the bisected " TWO " in red on 50 cents on is., slate—have been
cut diagonally. They were, I believe, kept ready cut in the post office for sale,
whereas the London surcharged series are oftener, according to my experience,
cut vertically down the middle of the stamp, a much easier way, it seems to me,
of dividing the stamps when in an entire pane, and that, perhaps, is the reason
of it.A bisected 3 cents on 3d. is chronicled in The Philatelic Record for November 1888, " side by side with an entire stamp of the same value. It had evidently,
franked some printed matter and was without much doubt so treated try the
office where the packet was posted." It is not stated whether the local or London
print is referred to, but from the date, November, 1888, I expect it was the
London overprint. The matter is not of much moment, as no 4! cent was
possible under the Postal Tariff, and the piece is simply a philatelic freak.
