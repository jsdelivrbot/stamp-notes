\chapter{1902-04 King Edward VII}
When King Edward VII came to the throne, De La Rue were printing all British, Indian,
some 60 Colonial territories and also foreign countries’ postage stamps, over 3,500 million annually plus at least half as many again revenue and fiscal stamps. Their position as the leading stamp printer was built on their method of economical security surface printing, employing their fugitive inks. At this time doubly fugitive ink was available in purple, green and black. An impression printed in these colours would be defaced if removal of a pen or rubber cancellation was attempted.

Many other colours were printed in singly fugitive ink when a printed impression would be defaced before an oil based cancellation could be removed.
In 1904, after many experiments, they introduced as an additional security measure chalk
surfaced paper. Mill sheets were coated, the chalk dyed to match coloured papers, at about three reams a time on machinery designed and installed at Bunhill Row. Immersing a stamp in water quickly removed the surfacing leaving pale bleached doubly fugitive colours.

In 1905 examples of suspected manipulation were forwarded to De La Rue. Unfortunately,
the source or the examples are not recorded. In their words, “this has been so cleverly done that no one but an expert could discover fraud and even by examination of stamps detached from their envelopes.” This caused great consternation at Bunhill Row that the bedrock of their success was in question. Whilst their fugitive inks deterred the fraudulent re-use of stamps, it seems that they had not considered that a professional forger would replicate their stamps. Paradoxically, his task was made much simpler when impressions could easily be bleached out leaving him with genuine watermarked and perforated blank stamps to print onto.
