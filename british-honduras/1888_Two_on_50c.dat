\section{"Two" on 50 cents 1s., Slate Wmk. Crown CA.}

Due to a shortage occurring in the 2 cents value, and as Messrs. De La Rue
& Company's consignment, which was at this time (May, 1888) expected, had
not arrived, most of the sheets of the 50 cents on is., slate, on hand, for which
there was a very small demand, were converted into 2 cents stamps by overprinting
them with the word " TWO." This is found as a rule over the numerals
"50."

"two" in red on 50c. grey block of four, unused with large part original gum, the top left stamp small corner perf thin and the top right stamp with very light tone on reverse, fresh and fine appearance. S.G. 35, £240 
Estimate £150 to £180}


This overprint is said to have been done singly by means of a handstamp.
The overprint is known in black; possibly these were a trial, and the red ink
substituted with the object of making the additional overprint more easily
readable than black on black. Some of the trial sheets with " TWO " in black
received an additional " TWO " in red, evidently also a trial.

The black overprints and the double (black and red) overprints are very
rare. There were two of the black in the Ferrari sale, the last one realising,
with Auctioneer's commission, £85 : the Ferrari collection also contained one
specimen of the black "TWO," with additional " TWO " printed in red. The
50 cents on 1s. with "TWO" in red are fairly common.

A peculiar variety, which casts doubts as to the method of printing of the stamps is shown in Figure~\ref{varhalf}. The variety shows the "two" in red on 50c. grey showing the bottom half of "two" missing and it was sold at the Foxley sale as Lot 1632. Examining the variety one cannot but conclude that a piece of paper or perhaps another stamp took the other half of the strike.
