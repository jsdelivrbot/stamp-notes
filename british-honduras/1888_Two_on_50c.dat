\section{"Two" on 50 cents 1s., Slate Wmk. Crown CA.}

Due to a shortage occurring in the 2 cents value, and as Messrs. De La Rue
& Company's consignment, which was at this time (May, 1888) expected, had
not arrived, most of the sheets of the 50 cents on is., slate, on hand, for which
there was a very small demand, were converted into 2 cents stamps by overprinting
them with the word " TWO." This is found as a rule over the numerals
"50."

This overprint is said to have been done singly by means of a handstamp.
The overprint is known in black; possibly these were a trial, and the red ink
substituted with the object of making the additional overprint more easily
readable than black on black. Some of the trial sheets with " TWO " in black
received an additional " TWO " in red, evidently also a trial.

The black overprints and the double (black and red) overprints are very
rare. There were two of the black in the Ferrari sale, the last one realising,
with Auctioneer's commission, £85 : the Ferrari collection also contained one
specimen of the black "TWO," with additional " TWO " printed in red. The
50 cents on 1s. with "TWO" in red are fairly common.

In a follow up paper in the \textit{London Philatelist}  L. J. Gilbert-Lodge 
disagreed with Mr. Beckton's for the following reasons :—
\begin{letter}
For many years after the issue of this variety, no mention was made in the
Catalogue of it, the " TWO " in red only being listed. Mr. W. G. Aikman, who
had a business and resided in Belize, British Honduras, was a keen stamp collector
and always looking out for varieties. He was also apparently a persona grata
with the Postal officials. When he visited England, he called on an old friend of
his, Mr. W. H. Peckitt, and gave him the following information :—

There are thirty stamps to a sheet, in six vertical rows of 5 each, and a
certain number of sheets of the " 50 cent " on One shilling, grey, were handed to
the local printer to again surcharge with the word " TWO " over the figures " 50."
He had to account for all the sheets, this being a fairly high denomination. The
type was set in two vertical rows of 5, that is, ten to a printing. The first four
vertical rows were printed in black, i.e. 20 stamps, and as he saw this did not
show at all clearly over the " 50," he cleaned the type of black ink and overprinted
two rows again in red ink, and the remaining two rows and all the subsequent
sheets in red ink only. All the sheets were returned to the Post Office
and, as was the custom then, one stamp of each surcharge was put in the Post
Office Stamp Record Book as a specimen. Incidentally, the post office of Belize
was afterwards destroyed by fire and these two copies burnt. As to the remaining
eighteen copies, one was sold over the post office counter to a Mr. Wolfsohn, who
sent it to a large collector in Europe, doubtless Baron Von Ferrari. Mr. Aikman
happened to be in the post office and purchased the remaining seventeen copies :
on his visit to Mr. Peckitt, he sold him four of each—two or three he gave to
relatives, but afterwards reobtained possession of them. When Mr. Peckitt
retired from business, he was succeeded by Mr. R. Roberts, and Mr. Aikman
called on him about 1919. Mr. Aikman then had three black and four red and
black surcharges, which Mr. Roberts bought, and this accounts for nearly all of
them.
\end{letter}

It  therefore appeats taht Mr. Beckton's statement as to Trial sheets is not correct. Incidentally,
the confirmation of the very limited number, i.e. ten of each variety, is
borne out by the scarcity and high prices realised whenever one is dealt with.
Mr. Aikman also bought nearly all of the " 6 " in red and " 6 " in black inverted
surcharges, using many of them on correspondence addressed to himself. Many other 'Aikman' covers exist and philately owes him gratitude for helping to preserve these covers.

A peculiar variety, which casts doubts as to the method of printing of the stamps is shown in Figure~\ref{varhalf}. The variety shows the "two" in red on 50c. grey showing the bottom half of "two" missing and it was sold at the Foxley sale as Lot 1632. Examining the variety one cannot but conclude that a piece of paper or perhaps another stamp took the other half of the strike.
