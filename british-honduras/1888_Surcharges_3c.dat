\section{3 Cents on 3d. (Crown CC) Perforation 12 1/2}

The number of known specimens of this stamp is very limited and in an
unused state it commanded the high price of Â£102 in the Ferrari sale;
curiously, there is only one specimsn in the Tapling collection, and that one
happens to be unused.

As we have seen, the stamp perforated 12 1/2 was noticed at quite an early
date, being chronicled by The Philatelic Record in December, 1888, upon the
information of Mr. Usher, who very possibly had had the stamp a little time
before troubling to write in those days. With the limited number of used
specimens available, it seemed hopeless, at first, ever being able to say anything
very definite as to the setting, but more recently I have been able to
" plate " to my own satisfaction two or three specimens with my large block
illustrated on Plate B. It therefore follows that the stamps perf. 12 1/2 and
perf. 14 of the 3 cents on 3d. were surcharged at the same time.

The small quantity of the 3d. stamps, perforated 12 1/2, which were surcharged
is a factor in support of this deduction. Forgeries of the surcharge on the stamps
perf. 12 1/2 have been known for many years.
