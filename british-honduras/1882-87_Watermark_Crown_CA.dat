\chapter{1882-1887 Watermark Crown CA}

Early in June 1883 negotiations began between De La Rue and the Crown Agents for the stablishment of a generally accepted scheme for the colours of the Colonial postage stamps, bearing in mind that the colours for teh Halfpenny, One Penny and Two Pence halfpenny equivalents had been determined by the regulations of the International Postal Convention. The firm had agreed with the Crown Agents to supply them with a formal letter, accompanied by specimens where necessary, to submit to each individual Colonial Government.

The firm then proceeded to prepare a number of colour schemes, with a formal letter of explanation to teh Crown Agensts. Each letter mentioned the stamp which had been selected to illustrate the various colours prepared. The following letter for British Honduras, dated July 25th, is the first in the Correspondence Book.

Easton writes that the British Honduras authorities approved the De La Rue's colony's scheme on October 1, 1883; It involved changes in the One Penny, Sixpence and One Shilling. The first order thereafter, invoiced on September 11, 1884, included 48,000 One Penny stamps. An order for 6,000 Sixpence was invoiced on October 31st. The first supply of One Shilling (3,000 stamps) was invoiced on October 4th 1886; of this stamp 400 stamps, overprinted \textsc{specimen}, were supplied to the Postal Union.

With reference to our interview with you some time ago as to the colours (p.378)

On October 1st De La Rue received the following letter in reply from the Crown Agents:

The new scheme of colours for the British Honduras Postage stamps submitted with your letter of the 25th July last, having been approved by the Colonial Government, I have to acquaint you that as stocks of stamps of the existing colours become exhausted, fresh supplies are to be printed in the colours of the new scale.
