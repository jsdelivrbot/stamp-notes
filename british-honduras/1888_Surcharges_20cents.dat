For this value the lower four rows of the setting were applied to the top four
rows of the pane of the 6d., and then the whole setting of thirty-six was applied
to the remaining six lower rows of the pane, so that the margin at the top of the
panes always shows an impression (usually albino) of the second row of the
setting.*

VARIETIES AND ERRors.

Apart from the setting of the curly tail " z," of which probably only one
pane ever existed, and the setting of the pane shown on Plate C, which is unique,
these overprints were remarkably carefully done and entirely free from errors
with three exceptions :—

(a) 5 cents on is., slate.

(b) 2 cents on id., carmine, with surcharge inverted.

(c) 2 cents on id., carmine, surcharged twice.

As to (a) : This might be due to either of two causes—either the cipher was
never set up after the "5," so as to make it read "50," or the cipher was set
too low and failed to print. It occurred once on the sheet and is rare. There
would seem to be no doubt that the error was detected during printing, as it
is not known upon any of the stamps of the 50 cents on is., slate, value which
received the additional overprint " TWO " in red in May, 1888.

As to (b) : This is somewhat scarce and possibly only one or at most two
sheets were so printed, most of which were saved, as all the specimens
I have seen are unused, which is easily accounted for by a sheet being
included in the importations made at the time by one of the English
dealers. I am told by the dealers who imported the two trial sheets that they
paid simply face value, and possibly no distinction was drawn by the Post Office
at Belize between them and the normal surcharges with which they had evidently
got mixed up for sale. It is simply due to chance that they have come to be
preserved. This same firm, however, tells me that they never had among their
importations any 2 cents on id. with inverted or with double surcharge, but
another firm had a sheet or part sheet sent at face value in much the same
manner.

As to (c) : This variety is quite distinct—not merely a slipped overprint—
and is equally as scarce as (b).

Specimens of the 10 cents on 4d. are occasionally met with having an inverted
surcharge, but they all bear a forged overprint. I have had a used copy for years,
in which the figures " 10 " differ from the regular stamp. The " i " has a
thicker downstroke and the "o " is a different type. The " O " seems to be
the same type as that on a used copy I have of the 50 cents on is., the surcharge
of which is, also, forged. The " 5 " is, too, a different type on the latter. The
word " CENTS " is a little too short on both stamps. Mr. Bacon, who has been
very kind in making helpful suggestions for this paper, tells me that the Royal
collection has a used specimen of this 50 c. with the same forgery of the
surcharge.

Although I cannot say how many of the 2 cents on id. inverted surcharge
found their way to this country unused, probably the bulk of them did so ;
at all events, I do not remember ever having seen a used specimen. The fact
that none of the values, other than 2 cents on id., are found with a genuine
inverted surcharge is in itself a point in favour of these inverted surcharges
having been bona fide errors.
* What probably happened was that the sheets were surcharged from the bottom instead
of commencing with the top portion.
