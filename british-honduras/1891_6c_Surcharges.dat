##British Honduras

In an article in the London Philatelist Bernard D, Harmer, questioned the at the time prevalent opinion that the 'SIX' in red on the 10c on 4p is an essay and proposed that they might have been used for postage. He writes:

\begin{letter}
IN EXAMINING in depth the wonderful collection of British Honduras, partly exhibited
late last year at Aniphilex '71 by Sir Henry Tucker, KBE, I was intrigued by his
representation of the so-called essay of the 'SIX' in red on the lOc on 4p either with (usually)
or without (rarely) bar. Gibbons does not mention the essay at all. Scott refers to it as
'prepared but not regularly issued'. Lowe in his 1935 Encyclopaedia writes 'the provisional
was at first surcharged 'SIX', but these were not issued, although one copy passed through
the post'. Moens (1891) writes 'Ce sont des essais, peut-etre bien de carotte.' (Carotte is
translated among other words as trick or fraud!) Munk writes (translated): 'Only one
sheet of thirty was overprinted 'SIX' instead of '6'. Poole states that one stamp got to an
English officer who put it unnoticed by the authorities on his mail. This unique copy still
exists, the other twenty-nine stamps were destroyed.' The Royal Collection has two examples,
one with and one without bar.
\end{letter}

The 'Tucker' collection refutes everything written and leaves in considerable doubt
whether the stamp was or was not regularly issued. It contains:

'SIX' without bar

Three unused singles

Vertical strip of four on Registered cover, addressed to C. H. Mekeel, the Stamp and
Publishing Company in St Louis. Mailed 12 May 1891. (See Figure~\ref{fraud02}.)

'SIX' with bar
Four unused singles, block of fifteen, complete sheet of thirty.
Vertical strip of four on Registered cover, addressed to the Scott Stamp & Coin
Co, mailed 17 June 1891. (See illustration.)

Bernard Harmer found it reasonable to assume that the written comment on the album sheet with the sheet of thirty,
stating, in John Luff's handwriting 'These are from the original lot sent to the Scott Stamp
& Coin Co, probably in one of the envelopes on the next page'  It is reasonable to assume
that the Scott Stamp & Coin envelope mentioned above is 'one of the envelopes on the
next page' referred to by Mr Luff. The two envelopes described by Harmer, resurfaced in the Simon Richards sale and we illustrate them in Figures~\ref{fraud01} and \ref{fraud02}.

In the same collection is a Registered cover from the Post Office, British Honduras
addressed to Doming Becton (sic) bearing examples of the issued '6' with bar in red and
in black. It was Registered and mailed 2 May 1891. It is interesting to note that ten days
prior to the letter to Mekeel and six weeks prior to the letter to Scott, the normal stamps
were being officially used. One might assume than an 'essay', obviously produced in reasonably
limited quantities (even if more than one sheet), would be considered of greater
worth than the normal stamp which is comparatively common even today (15p catalogue).
The sender of the sheet or sheets (probably the latter) to Scott, would have some knowledge
of philately as a correspondent of Scott or would be a Post Office employee. For him to
send the 'SIX' stamp would seem therefore to be an oversight because the stamps were
mixed in with the regular '6'stamps.

Are these stamps therefore as much issued as the 'TWO' surcharge in black on the 50c on
Is gray issue (SG35b), which proved unsatisfactory, with the surcharge then applied in
red - even in a few instances on the already surcharged black 'TWO' (SG35c)?
It seems that the dismissal of the 'SIX' surcharge solely as an essay is too simple an
explanation. Additional information would be appreciated.
