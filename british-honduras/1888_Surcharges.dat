# 1888 Surcharges

A decree changing the currency from sterling to dollar came into force on 1 January, 1888. To meet the demand for stamps in the new currency, locally held stocks were surcharged with values expressed in cents, to the values 2 cents, 3 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents and 50 cents. The 1 cent stamp was made by cutting the 2 cents stamp diagonally across.

The Royal Philatelic Society's publication on West Indies gives
the date of issue as 1st January, 1888, based, no doubt, upon
the decree, which is therein set out in extenso, changing the
postal rates from sterling to a dollar and cent denomination.
This decree names January ist, 1888, as the day on which the
change should come into force.

Time did not permit of obtaining a new issue of stamps from London
(Messrs. De La Rue & Co. were then printing the postage stamps for use in the
Colony), so recourse was had to overprinting the stamps in the Colony with a
new value expressed in cents.

The whole series does not appear to have been issued at once, but that is not
very material, because the stamps did appear in quick succession to complete
the series which is now well known.

The stamps are chronicled in the \textit{American Journal of Philately} of February,
1888, as follows :—

2 c. on 6d., rose

3 c. on 3d., brown

10 c. on 4d., violet gauge of perf. not mentioned.

20 c. on 6d., yellow

50 c. on 1s., grey ,

The first mention of these stamps in the philatelic magazines published in
Europe was in the month of March, 1888, when \textit{Le Timbre-poste}, \textit{The Philatelic
Record} and Alfred Smith's \textit{Monthly Circular} all chronicle some of them. Further
notices are published in the same journals in the months of April and June.
Anyone reading these will be forced to the conclusion that so far as the two
English ones are concerned they are practically identical,\sidenote{This is probably due to the late Mr. W. A. Westoby editing the Philatelic-Record at
this time, and he was also editor of Alfred Smith's Monthly Circular from 1879 to his death in October, 1899. (Cat. of Crawford Library.)} the same mistakes
being repeated, and subsequently corrected.

The Philatelic Record of March, 1888,  states :—

\begin{letter}
"The pounds, shillings and pence have succumbed to the almighty dollar.
The alteration, so far as regards the postage stamps, has been effected by
surcharging the current type with ' CENTS ' and the numeral above (2, 10,
20 or 50). This is done on the one penny, carmine; the four pence, mauve;
the six-pence, orange-yellow; and the one shilling, slate-grey—all on paper
watermark Crown C A. Whether the threepence has been surcharged, we
are unable to say—but we think it has, and probably with 5 cents; but we
have not seen it and only chronicle those we have seen. It is almost superfluous
to add that the stamps are perforated 14."
\end{letter}

This information, based, doubtless, upon a consignment of these particular
stamps to the publishers of one of these journals, was somewhat belated, as
I have evidence before me as I write that these small surcharges, including
the 2 cents on 6d., rose, Crown C C, perf. 14, and the same stamp bisected, were
posted from Belize on January i6th, 1888, and reached a then well-known firm
of Stamp Importers in this country on February 4th, 1888.

The March number of Le Timbre-Poste chronicled the 2 c. on, 6d., rose (no
perforation mentioned), the 3 c. on 3d., brown (no perforation mentioned), and
the 10 c. on 4d., mauve, and the following month (April) chronicled as received
the following :—

2 c. on id., C A.

3 c. on 3d., CC.

10 c. on 4d., C A.

20 c. on 6d., C A.

50 c. on is., C A.

Adding: " We announced the 2 cents was on the sixpence (taken from other
journals) : this must be an error."

In May, however, upon the authority of M. Friedl, they reinstate the 2 cents
on 6d.

The \textit{Philatelic Record} and the \textit{Monthly Circular} in April mention the 2 cents on
6d., rose, Crown C C, and the 3 cents on 3d., brown, Crown CA!!

In the June number of each, this latter is corrected to Crown CC. Nothing
is mentioned in any of the Journals as to the perforation of the other two stamps
until the December, 1888, number of The Philatelic Record, which says :—

\begin{letter}
" Mr. Usher informs us that he has the 2 cents on sixpence, rose, and the
3 cents on threepence, brown, chronicled in our number for April, perforated
both 14 and 12 J. We did not mention the perforation at the time."
\end{letter}

The curious thing is that although having corrected the mistake in April,
they repeat the error by giving the watermark of the 3d. as C A instead of C C.
Such is the sum and substance of the published information upon these
stamps at the time of issue.

In the year 1910 a monograph, entitled: The Postage Stamps of British
Honduras, by Bertram W. H. Poole, was published.*

The chapter in this monograph dealing with the surcharged stamps, after
quoting in extenso a decree dated " The General Post Office, Belize, 1 December,
1887," says :—

\begin{letter}
"The surcharge consists of Arabic numerals of value 3 mm. high, with
the word 'CENTS' in Roman capitals below. This word is 15 mm. long and
the letters are 2j mm. high, while the space between the two lines of the
surcharge measures 2 mm. I must here state my indebtedness to Messrs.
Whitfield, King & Co., of Ipswich, for so kindly placing the whole of their
stock of British Honduras stamps at my disposal for the purpose of examination.
But for the opportunity thus afforded of closely examining so many
entire sheets and large blocks, it would have been impossible for me to give
much of the following information regarding the settings of the surcharges, etc.

" The 2 c. on id., the commonest of the locally surcharged stamps, was
surcharged in blocks of 36 (six horizontal rows of six), and as a pane consisted
of 60 stamps, the top six rows were first of all' surcharged and then the four
lower rows. A piece of paper was evidently placed over the two lower rows
of type to prevent them printing on the bottom margin, for ' blind' impressions
of the surcharge can often be traced.
\end{letter}

" The type used was not of the best nor was the workmanship of the
highest class., Smudged and imperfect letters are common, but the only
minor varieties that are ' permanent.' are the following :—

No. 2.—The ' N ' of ' CENTS ' is badly broken right across its centre.

No. 10.—There is no serif at the top of the left-hand stroke of the ' N '
of ' CENTS.'

No. 20.—The second upright stroke of the ' N ' of ' CENTS ' is broken in
the centre.

No. 23.—The ' c' of ' CENTS ' is broken at the top so that the letter
appears as a series of dots for the space of about i mm.

No. 25.—There is a small break in the fcentre of the second upright stroke
of the ' N ' of ' CENTS.'

No. 27.—The ' 2 ' is broken at the top and also in the centre.

" Some of the letters seem to vary slightly in size, the ' s' and ' N ' on some
. stamps being apparently a little narrower than on others; but these are,
at best, elusive varieties. Dropped letters also occur, but I have found
nothing to prove that any of these are ' constant.'

" The position of the ' 2 ' in relation to the word ' CENTS ' varies as
follows :—

(1) The extreme left of the base of the numeral is exactly in line with
the first upright stroke oi the ' N.'

(2) The left end of the base of the numeral is above the space between
the letters ' EN.'

(3) The left end of the base of the numeral is slightly to the right of the
first stroke of the ' N.'

" These varieties are arranged as follows in the setting :—


" Evidently the same type was used for all the values, but it was re-set—
probably for each. Thus I find in the 20 c. on 6d. the variety which occurs
on the second stamp in the case of the 2 c. now appears on stamp No. 26.
" The 20 c. on 6d. is the only other value of which I have seen a large
block, and in this I find there are two varieties differing in the position of the
numerals in relation to the word ' CENTS/ viz.:—

(1) The extreme left end of the base of the ' 2 ' is in line with the top
right end of the ' E.'

(2) The point of the ' 2 ' is almost above the centre of the ' E.' "
It is in the hope of being able to add something to our knowledge concerning

these local surcharges that I have decided to write these notes upon certain
entire panes and pieces in my collection.
The length of the word "CENTS " is usually 15 mm., but in some it extends
to 15^-15\ mm. The better measurement, I find, is to take the distance from
the top of the lower loop of the •" c " to outer curve of " s " which is usually
13 mm., but varies in some to I3j-i3i mm. These longer varieties are usually
in the fourth and fifth vertical rows of the pane.


\section{2 CENTS on one Penny, Carmine, WMK. Crown CA.}

Of this I have an entire pane with the right-hand margin; another pane
(deeper shade) with three stamps missing, namely, Nos. 6,12, and 26, showing
full top and bottom margins; also a part pane of forty-two with left-hand
margin, and two used large blocks of sixteen and nine each. These are all from
the same setting : in fact, I have never seen any surcharges on this value which
do not belong to this setting. The setting is a peculiar one, having regard to
the size of the sheets (the id. stamps were in sheets of one hundred and twenty,
in two panes of sixty, side by side). I consider that there is evidence to prove
that they were surcharged one pane at a time, the sheets having been cut in
two before receiving the overprint, so that what was originally a pane only of
the stamps when unsurcharged became an entire Post Office sheet in the surcharged
issue. The surcharge was set up in a block of thirty-six, six by six, so
it overprinted the top six horizontal rows of the pane, and the remaining four
horizontal rows were a repeat of the upper four rows of this block.
