10 CENTS ON 4d., MAUVE, WMK. CROWN C A.

Of this value my collection only contains two blocks, one of twenty and
the other of nine, both from the top of the sheet, showing top and side margins
(see Plate D).

of peculiar interest. They both show that the top horizontal row is the
row of the surcharge described above as horizontal row number two, and the
rows below follow in correct sequence; consequently, the same setting was
used for this as for the other two values already described.

On the top margin both blocks show a horizontal row of the surcharge of the
20-cents value, the types of which I have identified as Nos. i-6.f In one block
this is a faint- greyish black impression, and in the other an albino impression.
In considering these 10 cents on 4d., it is important to recall the circumstance
that the stamps of this 4d. value were printed by Messrs. De La Rue in sheets
of thirty stamps in five horizontal rows of six each, and in this respect the sheets
differed from all the other values of this series. The consequence was that the
setting, which comprised, as we have seen, six horizontal rows of six, contained
one row more than was required for overprinting these sheets. What happened
was that the numerals in the bottom five rows of the setting used for the overprint
of the 20 cents were alone altered from " 20 " to " 10," and the top or
first row of the setting was left reading rE? In the printing, this top row,
which fell upon the top margin of the sheets in the 4d. value, was intended to
be left uninked, but naturally got more or less besmeared with ink and showed
up either as a lightly inked impression of the 20 cents value, or as an albino
impression, upon the top margin of the sheets. It therefore follows that the
10 cents on 4d. were of the same setting as the last five horizontal rows of the
20 cents on 6d., orange, and that both of these again were, as to the word " CENTS,"
identical with the 2 cents on 1d. and 3 cents on 3d. already described.

Perhaps I ought to mention that this is the first occasion on which this
curious phenomenon has been described, and the information given in reference
to the settings of the surcharges for this value and for the 3 cents on 3d. or
the 20 cents on 6d., orange, is believed also to be new.

I entirely dissent from the suggestion made by Mr. Poole, already quoted,
that the type was re-set for each value. I take it that in using the word type
he refers to the word " CENTS " (obviously, the numerals were altered).
If I am correct, it shows that the " setting " would assuredly be type-set
and not a stereo : had a stereo been made, it would have almost certainly
involved making one for each value, but the 10 cents value shows that this was
clearly not the case, and what took place in the 2 cents on 6d., rose, mentioned
above, all points strongly to the same conclusion, namely, that the surcharges
were "type set."

J Since this article was written I have acquired an entire sheet with full margins of the
10 cents on 4d., mauve, it confirms what I have said.
The upper margin shows an albino impression of the 20 cents value, and the numeral
7 of 70 has a large break in it near the foot.
