\chapter{1888-91 London Provisionals}

The change of currency in British Honduras led to an urgent requisition for supplies of the existing stamps overprinted with new values. In an early article in the LP and in the Royal Philatelic Society's publication on West Indies the date of issue for these surcharges was given as 1st January, 1888. This was probably based as mentioned in the article on the changing of the postal rates from sterling to a dollar and cents denomination. This {{wi:decree}} names January 1st, 1888, as the day on which the change would come to force. As it can be deduced from the De La Rue archives this was incorrect and the stamps were issued much later.

The stamps were first chronicled in the American Journal of Philately of February, as follows:

Of interest was the announcing of the stamps in  \textit{The Philatelic Record}, The
March, 1888, number says :—

" The pounds, shillings and pence have succumbed to the almighty dollar.
The alteration, so far as regards the postage stamps, has been effected by
surcharging the current type with ' CENTS ' and the numeral above (2, 10,
20 or 50). This is done on the one penny, carmine; the four pence, mauve;
the six-pence, orange-yellow; and the one shilling, slate-grey—all on paper
watermark Crown CA. Whether the threepence has been surcharged, we
are unable to say—but we think it has, and probably with 5 cents ; but we
have not seen it and only chronicle those we have seen. It is almost superfluous
to add that the stamps are perforated 14."
