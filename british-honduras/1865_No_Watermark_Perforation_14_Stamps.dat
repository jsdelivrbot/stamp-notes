\index{1865 Issue! Issued stamps}
The sheet of this issue, from the first printing, were printed in an unusual format of four panes of sixty, the upper two being the 1d. value, the lower left the 1/- and the lower right the 6d. Subsequent orders for the 1d. were printed in sheets of 120. A proving block was in the Sir Henry Tucker Collection and appeared again in 2005, when Spinks auctioned the Simon Richards Collection of British Honduras. This block is one of the greatest rarity of British Honduras and fetched a price of \pounds 122,000. One can observe the "dropped perforation" on the left-hand pane, right stamps characteristic of the perforator at the time (See the same also in Figure~\ref{droppedperforation}).
