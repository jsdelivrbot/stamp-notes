These stamps predated De La Rue's Key Plate system so they had to be engraved separately.

The only dated die proof of the 6d. was in the collection of Brigadier F.M. Montresor (1966) and re-appeared again in the Foxley sale in 2014.  The 1/- can also be found on a die proof; this die proof is stamp sized and is printed in black on a glazed card and inset on a thick card (37x43mm). It was last seen in the Foxley sale.

Earlier we made a comment regarding the Perforation of  the stamps and the Construction of the Plate. I could not trace any stamps se-tenant, but perhaps they exist in the Royal collection. \index{Royal collection|se-tenant}
