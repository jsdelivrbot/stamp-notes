\chapter{1865 No Watermark, Perf. 14}

In 1866 the colony introduced its own stamps. The design was a profile of Queen Victoria typical of British stamps of the time, with an oval band reading "BRITISH HONDURAS" and the denomination, which in the first issue consisted of 1d, 6d, and 1sh values. The design continued in use until the Key Plate issue of 1891, with periodic changes of watermark and perforation.

These stamps predated De La Rue's Key Plate system so they had to be engraved separately.

The 1/- can also be found on a die proof; this die proof is stamp sized and is printed in black on a glazed card and inset on a thick card (37x43mm). It was last seen in the Foxley sale.

Earlier we made a comment regarding the Perforation of  the stamps and the Construction of the Plate. I could not trace any stamps se-tenant, but perhaps they exist in the Royal collection. \index{Royal collection|se-tenant}
