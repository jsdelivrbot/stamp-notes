<h2>Math box.js </h2>

I have a very strong suspicion that these routines were used by Google's engineers in their Chrome browser developers console. Have a look at the image below which is a snap of the console metrics tab.

<img src="/codeigniter/images/metrics.jpg" style="display:block;margin:0 auto" />

As is noted on the top of the file, these routines are quite useful for representing margins and padding! Voila! It is very re-assuring!

<div  class="code-block console-wrap">
<div class="code-block code">
<code>
//A box is specified as a top, right, bottom,
// * and left. A box is useful for representing margins and padding.

var p1 = new goog.math.Box(15,25, 0, 0 );


log(p1.toString());

<h3>An interesting sideline</h3>
The class Coordinate includes a method named __squaredDistance__, which returns the squared distance between two coordinates. 

Nothing spectacular about what it does, but normally if you were to compare distances of lines on a graph, you will need the square root. However, the observation made by the Google engineer was that if you only need to compare, you might as well use the square rather than the square root. There was a note in the file that this is faster and that in lower level languages one always strive to elminate square roots. He also noted that the speed difference in JavaScript is only a few percent. This got me curious and had it checked below. The speed difference actually is quite substantial (as a percentage).

{{bulb: I keep reminding myself of  my dictum if you take care of the microseconds, the seconds will take care of themselves! by ... me}}

<div  class="code-block console-wrap">
<div class="code-block code">
<code>
function square(a) {
  var y = a * a;
  return y;
}

function squareRoot(a) {
  var z = Math.sqrt(a);
  return z;
}

profiler.start();
for (var i = 0; i < 30000; i++) {
  var n1 = square(10);
}

profiler.stop();
profiler.timeDiff();

profiler.start();
for (var i = 0; i < 30000; i++) {
  var n2 = squareRoot(n1);
}

profiler.stop();
profiler.timeDiff();
