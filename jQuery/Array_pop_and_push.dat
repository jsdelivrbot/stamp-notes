## The array methods pop() and push()

The `pop()` method is used to remove the last element of the array, whereas the `push()` method is used to append elements to the array. They affect the arrays directly.


{{bulb: pop() and push()   change the original array.}}

Observe the following example to understand what is being returned from the methods, as mentioned above all these methods change the original array directly.

\begin{codeblock}
// pop and push example
// note pop and push change
// the original array
var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
b = a.pop();
log('results from pop () = ', b);
log('array after pop() = ', a);

c = a.push('new 1', 'new 2', 'new 3');
log('return value from push = ', c);
log('array after push = ', a);

\end{codeblock}
