Some Computer Scientists like <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ola/papers/bubble.pdf">Owen Astrachan</a> preach that the Bubble Sort should be removed from Computer Science books and his argument goes something like this:

<blockquote>
Although
examples used in first year courses must be simple
enough to be understandable and complex enough to
be useful in a variety of situations, they should also
exemplify best practices so that these practices endure
after many of the details of a course have been forgotten.
</blockquote>

But he is right in claiming that Bubble Sort is a term that most Computer Science graduates will remember from their Algo classes! Personally I wouldn't like to see it removed as it conjures happy memories of a time that just studying algorithms was new and a much happier time of my life. In support for it also, it is a good example to use while learning the _syntax_ of a new language, which for most Computer Science students will be about the same time that they are learning the concept.

In any case in  practical situations the best sort to use is the
one provided by the standard (e.g., Python, Java, C, or C++)
libraries. However, we study sorts because general sorts
do not work in all situations and because sorting is a
simple illustration of algorithmic techniques. JavaScript provides a built-in method for sorting arrays and you can find more about it in ['Sorting Arrays in Javascript'](../jquery/Array_sort).
