<h2>Cadaeic Cadenza, Javascript Regular Expressions and &pi;!</h2>
I have explored previously in this article how to find the value of &pi; by throwing needles on a floor! In this article I will show you how to determine &pi; to 3835 digits by parsing a poem!

<h2>Cadaeic Cadenza</h2>
The idea of writing a sentence (or longer piece of poetry or prose) in which the lengths of successive words represent the digits of the number &#960; (=3.14159265358979...) has been around since the early 1900's.  

One of the earliest and most well-known examples is the following sentence, believed to have been composed by the English physicist {{wi:Sir_James_Jeans}}:

{{example:
How I need a drink, alcoholic in nature, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics!
}}

The first word in this sentence has 3 letters, the next word 1 letter, the next word 4 letters, and so on, following the first fifteen digits of the number &#960;. 

You can check it by running the program below:

<div class="code-block console-wrap">
<div class="code-block code">
<code>
say('start');
 var re = /\w+?\b/gi;
 var   s = $('#aPI').text();
          s =s.match(re); 
 var   pi='';  var length='';
 for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
  if (i == 0) {
    pi += s[i].length + '.';
  } else {
    pi += s[i].length + '';
     };
   log('', s[i], s[i].length);
}
log('pi :', pi);
log('PI :', Math.PI);
say('end');
</code>

</div>
<p id="aPI" class="shaded"> How I need a drink, alcoholic in nature, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics! </p>
<p class= "msg" id="msg" style="white-space:pre"></p>
<p class="console"></p>
  <button class="eval">Button</button>
<ol class="results"></ol>
</div>





 A longer example is this poem with ABAB rhyme scheme from Joseph Shipley's 1960 book Playing With Words:
{{plain:
But a time I spent wandering in gloomy1 night;
Yon tower, tinkling chimewise, loftily opportune.
Out, up, and together came sudden to Sunday rite,
The one solemnly off to correct plenilune.
}}

A longer poem written by A. Poe {{wi: Cadaeic_Cadenza}}, calculates pi to 1000 decimal places!

One
   A Poem 


        A Raven 

Midnights so dreary, tired and weary, 
    Silently pondering volumes extolling all by-now obsolete lore. 
During my rather long nap - the weirdest tap! 
    An ominous vibrating sound disturbing my chamber's antedoor. 
        "This", I whispered quietly, "I ignore".
Perfectly, the intellect remembers: the ghostly fires, a glittering ember. 
    Inflamed by lightning's outbursts, windows cast penumbras upon this floor. 
Sorrowful, as one mistreated, unhappy thoughts I heeded: 
    That inimitable lesson in elegance - Lenore - 
        Is delighting, exciting...nevermore.

Ominously, curtains parted (my serenity outsmarted), 
    And fear overcame my being - the fear of "forevermore". 
Fearful foreboding abided, selfish sentiment confided, 
    As I said, "Methinks mysterious traveler knocks afore. 
        A man is visiting, of age threescore."

Taking little time, briskly addressing something: "Sir," (robustly) 
    "Tell what source originates clamorous noise afore? 
Disturbing sleep unkindly, is it you a-tapping, so slyly? 
    Why, devil incarnate!--" Here completely unveiled I my antedoor-- 
        Just darkness, I ascertained - nothing more.

While surrounded by darkness then, I persevered to clearly comprehend. 
    I perceived the weirdest dream...of everlasting "nevermores". 
Quite, quite, quick nocturnal doubts fled - such relief! - as my intellect said, 
    (Desiring, imagining still) that perchance the apparition was uttering a whispered "Lenore". 
        This only, as evermore.

Silently, I reinforced, remaining anxious, quite scared, afraid, 
    While intrusive tap did then come thrice - O, so stronger than sounded afore. 
"Surely" (said silently) "it was the banging, clanging window lattice." 
    Glancing out, I quaked, upset by horrors hereinbefore, 
        Perceiving: a "nevermore".

Completely disturbed, I said, "Utter, please, what prevails ahead. 
    Repose, relief, cessation, or but more dreary 'nevermores'?" 
The bird intruded thence - O, irritation ever since! - 
    Then sat on Pallas' pallid bust, watching me (I sat not, therefore), 
        And stated "nevermores".

Bemused by raven's dissonance, my soul exclaimed, "I seek intelligence; 
    Explain thy purpose, or soon cease intoning forlorn 'nevermores'!" 
"Nevermores", winged corvus proclaimed - thusly was a raven named? 
    Actually maintain a surname, upon Pluvious seashore? 
        I heard an oppressive "nevermore".

My sentiments extremely pained, to perceive an utterance so plain, 
    Most interested, mystified, a meaning I hoped for. 
"Surely," said the raven's watcher, "separate discourse is wiser. 
    Therefore, liberation I'll obtain, retreating heretofore - 
        Eliminating all the 'nevermores' ".

Still, the detestable raven just remained, unmoving, on sculptured bust. 
    Always saying "never" (by a red chamber's door). 
A poor, tender heartache maven - a sorrowful bird - a raven! 
    O, I wished thoroughly, forthwith, that he'd fly heretofore. 
        Still sitting, he recited "nevermores".

The raven's dirge induced alarm - "nevermore" quite wearisome. 
    I meditated: "Might its utterances summarize of a calamity before?" 
O, a sadness was manifest - a sorrowful cry of unrest; 
    "O," I thought sincerely, "it's a melancholy great - furthermore, 
        Removing doubt, this explains 'nevermores' ".

Seizing just that moment to sit - closely, carefully, advancing beside it, 
    Sinking down, intrigued, where velvet cushion lay afore. 
A creature, midnight-black, watched there - it studied my soul, unawares. 
    Wherefore, explanations my insight entreated for. 
        Silently, I pondered the "nevermores".

"Disentangle, nefarious bird! Disengage - I am disturbed!" 
    Intently its eye burned, raising the cry within my core. 
"That delectable Lenore - whose velvet pillow this was, heretofore, 
    Departed thence, unsettling my consciousness therefore. 
        She's returning - that maiden - aye, nevermore."

Since, to me, that thought was madness, I renounced continuing sadness. 
    Continuing on, I soundly, adamantly forswore: 
"Wretch," (addressing blackbird only) "fly swiftly - emancipate me!" 
    "Respite, respite, detestable raven - and discharge me, I implore!" 
        A ghostly answer of: "nevermore".

" 'Tis a prophet? Wraith? Strange devil? Or the ultimate evil?" 
    "Answer, tempter-sent creature!", I inquired, like before. 
"Forlorn, though firmly undaunted, with 'nevermores' quite indoctrinated, 
    Is everything depressing, generating great sorrow evermore? 
        I am subdued!", I then swore.

In answer, the raven turned - relentless distress it spurned. 
    "Comfort, surcease, quiet, silence!" - pleaded I for. 
"Will my (abusive raven!) sorrows persist unabated? 
    Nevermore Lenore respondeth?", adamantly I encored. 
        The appeal was ignored.

"O, satanic inferno's denizen -- go!", I said boldly, standing then. 
    "Take henceforth loathsome "nevermores" - O, to an ugly Plutonian shore! 
Let nary one expression, O bird, remain still here, replacing mirth. 
    Promptly leave and retreat!", I resolutely swore. 
        Blackbird's riposte: "nevermore".

So he sitteth, observing always, perching ominously on these doorways. 
    Squatting on the stony bust so untroubled, O therefore. 
Suffering stark raven's conversings, so I am condemned, subserving, 
    To a nightmare cursed, containing miseries galore. 
        Thus henceforth, I'll rise (from a darkness, a grave) -- nevermore!

                        -- Allanpoe, E.

This is not exactly right as we Poe had considered some punctuation symbols as 'counting', whereas our regex did not.
