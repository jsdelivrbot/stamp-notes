##User Interface Design

My opinion is that the most critical factor for an application to succeed is to have a simple User Interface. As users move from application to application and from place to place on the web, attention spans are very small. Gone are the days that people had the patience and the will to master an application completely.

Here are my targets:

- Two click navigation (everything must be reachable within two clicks).
- Use both icons and words.
- A portion of the navigation (toolbar) must be accessible in the same form from anywhere.
- There should be no need to read a manual. If anything is complicated, it should be changed to a wizard to guide the user through.

Essentially it is quest for the golden fleece or the making of a better mousetrap.
