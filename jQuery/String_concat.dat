## String concat method 

Two or more strings can be joined by using the <strong>concat()</strong> method. When the concat method is called with zero or more arguments string1, string2, etc., it returns a
string consisting of the characters of this object (converted to a string) followed by the characters of
each of string1, string2, etc. (where each argument is converted to a string). The result is a string
value, not a String object. 

\begin{codeblock}

var s1='abcd';
var s2='efg';
var s3=s1+s2;
var s4 = s1.concat(s2);
log('concatenated strings', s4);
log('concatenated strings length', s4.length);
log(s3.length);

\end{codeblock}

ECMA specifies that the concat function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a String
object. Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method, as for example calling String.prototype.concat

{{bulb: the concat() method has a performance penalty do not use, but rather use the concatenation operator (+)}}
