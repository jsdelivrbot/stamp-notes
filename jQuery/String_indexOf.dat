<h3>String.prototype.indexOf()  method</h3>

If searchString appears as a substring of the result of converting this object to a string, at one or more positions that are greater than or equal to position, then the index of the smallest such position is returned; otherwise, -1 is returned. If position is undefined, 0 is assumed, so as to search all of the string.

{{bulb:This is a method of the String.prototype. If you need to transfer the property to another object you need to transfer  from String.prototype}}

See both the examples below for further information.

\begin{codeblock}
var s = 'testing';
var index = s.indexOf('inge');
(index>-1)?log("index of 'ing' = ", index): log('not found');
\end{codeblock}

The ECMA specification (15.5.3.2) does not specify that the fromCharAt() function is  generic; However, you can test it in your browser with the example below. As you  can observe it can be transferred to other kinds of objects to use as you may wish.

\begin{codeblock}
var text = {
  name: 'text'
};
text.fromCharCode = function () {
  return String.fromCharCode.apply(this.name, arguments);
};

log(text.fromCharCode(112, 113));
\end{codeblock}
