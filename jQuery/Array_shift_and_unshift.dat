## The array methods `shift()` and `unshift()`

The standard JavaScript functions shift() and unshift()  either delete elements from the __front__ of the array or insert elements at the __front__ of the array. The unshift method can take more than one arguments. A datastructure implemented only with arrays and shift() and unshift(), will represent a LIFO (last in first out) operation. 

{{bulb: shift() and unshift()   change the original array.}}

Observe the following example to understand what is being returned from the methods. This ambiguity can be resolved by writing your own methods prepend() etc..

\begin{code}
var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
b = a.shift();
log('results from shift () = ', b);
log('array after shift() = ', a);

c = a.unshift(1);
log('return value from unshift = ', c);
log('array after unshift = ', a);

\end{code}
