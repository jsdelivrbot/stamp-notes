<h2>Sometime in December 2009</h2>

I have been hacking day and night and reading a lot. I have almost reached to where I was earlier in my life _in the forefront of programming_. Lot's happened in the in-between. _Python_ appeared and seems to be moving fast. In any case my focus should be the web. The web is where everything is happening, the desktop is on its way out.

For the first time in my life - and I have been very lucky in this respect - I feel very very tired!
 
<h2>Late Sunday sometimes December 2009</h2>

Close to Christmas, Juliette invited me for coffee and at least had the chance to talk to a human being, took Athena's 'To Dad Scrapbook' for her to look! I have wonderful kids and need to keep walking for them. My body is telling me to stop!

Spend the whole day on web development looked at the SDK, sounds cloudy but good. It is all Python, why? Looks simple, must try it out. Tried it out, need confirmation via phone, number must be accredited agent, MTN is not, oh! well need to get a CYTA number. I had another gmail registered just for this it all takes time!
