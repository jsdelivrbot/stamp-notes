\section{Random Numbers and Javascript}


Before we start let me be absolutely clear. Only nature can produce truly random events! Any computer would produce random numbers, based on algorithms and it will come pretty close, so wherever you read in this article the word random, I actually mean pseudo-random. We will start with refreshing your memory about the Math.random() and we will end calculating the value of \\(\pi\\) using a {{wi:Monte Carlo}} simulation and a bunch of needles!

\end{document}

{{example:
<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>A plane is ruled with parallel lines 1 cm apart. A needle of length 1 cm is dropped randomly on the plane. What is the probability that the needle will be lying across one of the lines?</p>

<p><strong>Answer </strong>: 2/Pi.</p>

<p>This gives an interesting way to calculate Pi! If you throw down a large number of needles, the fraction of needles which lie across a line will get closer to 2/Pi the more needles that you throw. So, you can just throw down needles and count them to get an estimate for Pi!</p>

Buffon's Needle is a problem first posed by the French naturalist and mathematician, the {{wi:Comte_de_Buffon}} (1707-1788) and you have probably come along it during your high school maths class. 

Buffon was an interesting character that was a 'naturalist'. He was a contemporary of Linnaeus who had a very low opinion of him and is reputed to have name the from <em>bufo bufo</em> after Buffon.

Besides his many insights, he also propounded a theory that nature in the New World was inferior to that of Eurasia. He argued that the Americas were lacking in large and powerful creatures, and that even the people were far less virile than their European counterparts. He ascribed this to the marsh odours and dense forests of the continent. These remarks so incensed Thomas Jefferson that he immediately dispatched twenty soldiers to the New Hampshire woods to find a bull moose for Buffon as proof of the "stature and majesty of American quadrapeds." 10 It took over two weeks and when shot, the moose lacked imposing horns. Before being shipped back to France, a rack of antlers from a different stag was attached.10

Consider a plane, ruled with equidistant parallel lines, where the distance between the lines is D. A needle of length L is tossed onto the plane. What is the probability that the needle intersects one or more lines. The original problem had the condition that L < D, but in this version, we will also consider the probability where D  L.

With no more information than this, we have no way of knowing which part of the plane the needle is most likely to fall on. We do not know if the orientation of the needle is affected by the orientation of the lines, or by the needle&#8217;s location. Since we do not have this information, we can only assume that there are no such predictable relationships. Next, we must define appropriate random variables.

Orient the plane so that the parallel lines run horizontally. Now consider the lower end of the needle. If the needle is horizontal, it will not have a lower end. In that event (which has a probability of zero), choose the right end. Let Y be the distance from the lower end to the nearest line above it. We need not consider its horizontal position because a change in that direction would have no effect on the problem. And since the lines are equally spaced, it does not matter which lines the needle falls near. Now let the needle&#8217;s orientation angle, Q, be defined as shown in the diagram. It may have a value ranging from zero (right) counterclockwise to p (left). Q cannot be greater than p, because then the vertex of the angle would no longer be the lower end of the needle.

{{plain:
0 < Y < D

0 < Q < p
}}

When plotted on the q-y plane, the pair (Q,Y) is distributed over a rectangle with width p, and height D. We are assuming that the random variables, Q and Y, are independent and uniformly distributed. Both of these conditions are important. If they are met, then the variables&#8217; joint distribution is uniform. All subregions of equal area have equal probability of containing the point (Q,Y). We now must define the region representing successes. The probability is the ratio of the area of the success region to the area of the region of distribution.

<h2>Ants and Buffon's Needles</h2>

<em>Leptothorax albipennis</em><a href="http://eol.org/pages/37745">Encyclopedia of Life</a>}


Although you might struggle to find a practical application of Buffon's needles, some biologists think that ants use it!  S. T. Mugford, E. B. Mallon, and N. R. Franks
of the Centre for Mathematical Biology and Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, published a [paper](http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/12/6/655.pdf) [pdf] about how 
colonies of the ant <em>Leptothorax albipennis</em> naturally inhabit flat rock crevices. Scouts can determine, before initiating an emigration,
if a nest has sufficient area to house their colony. They think that they achieve this using Buffon's needle's method. So here you go, while you have to program this ants instinctively have it in their genes!
