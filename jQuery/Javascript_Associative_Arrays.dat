<h2>Associative Arrays</h2>
Let's get this straight. There are no associative arrays in Javascript! If you familiar with PHP, you must have been looking have to declare associative
arrays in vain. 

{{bulb: There are no associative arrays in JavaScript}}

Consider the following code (which works) and appears
to set values in an associative array. try it first.

<pre style="background:url(http://localhost/codeigniter/images/code-bg.gif)">
<div id="ex7">
   var sColors = new Array();
    sColors["Passion"] = "Red";
    sColors["Peace"] = "Green";
    sColors["Calm"] = "Blue";
 
  for(description in sColors) {  // print out the bands with descriptions
  alert(sColors[description] + " == " + description);
}
</div>
<button>Run</button>
</pre>

Now try to get the length of the array!

<pre style="background:url(http://localhost/codeigniter/images/code-bg.gif)">
<div id="ex7">
   var mColors = new Array();
    mColors["Passion"] = "Red";
    mColors["Peace"] = "Green";
    mColors["Calm"] = "Blue";
 
 
  alert(mColors.length);

</div>
<button>Run</button>
</pre>

So, what is happening here? essentially we have created an object and we have set the Object's properties.
