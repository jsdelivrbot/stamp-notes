<h2>Associative Arrays</h2>

Let's get this straight. There are no associative arrays in Javascript! If you familiar with PHP, you must have been looking have to declare associative
arrays in vain. 

{{bulb: There are no associative arrays in JavaScript}}

Consider the following code (which works) and appears
to set values in an associative array. try it first.

\begin{codeblock}
   var sColors = new Array();
    sColors["Passion"] = "Red";
    sColors["Peace"] = "Green";
    sColors["Calm"] = "Blue";
 
  for(description in sColors) {  // print out the bands with descriptions
  log(sColors[description] + " == " + description);
}
\end{codeblock}

Now try to get the length of the array!

\begin{codeblock}
   var mColors = new Array();
    mColors["Passion"] = "Red";
    mColors["Peace"] = "Green";
    mColors["Calm"] = "Blue";
 
 
   log(mColors.length);
\end{codeblock}


So, what is happening here? essentially we have created an object and we have set the Object's properties.
