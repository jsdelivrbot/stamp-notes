##Basic Statistics - Mean, Average and Mode

To get the \\(\sum n\\) for our formula, we multiply the number of people in each salary category by the salary for that category (e.g., \\(1 \times 20, 2 \times 25\\), etc.), and then total those numbers.  Thus we have:

    
$$ \bar x = \frac{\sum x}{n}$$


<h3>Preparing the Dataset</h3>

$$\(\(X\)\)$$

\begin{codeblock}
var DATA_LABELS = ['Salary (X)', 'Frequency (f)'],
DATA = [[20,1],[25,2],[30,3],[35,4],[40,5],[45,6],[50,5],[55,4],
                   [60,3],[65,2],[70,1] ],
length = DATA.length,
i = 0,
sum = 0,
temp = 0;
for (i = 0; i < length; i++) {
  sum = DATA[i][1] + sum;
  temp = DATA[i][1]*DATA[i][0] + temp;
}
var mean = temp/sum;
log(sum);
log(temp);
log(mean);
\end{codeblock}




<h3>Producing some tables and Graphs</h3>


<div  class="code-block console-wrap"><div class="code code-block"><code>
var element = goog.dom.getElement;
var i=0;
for (i = 0; i < DATA.length; i++) {
   DATA[i]=DATA[i][1];
} 
// Line Chart
    chart = new goog.ui.ServerChart(goog.ui.ServerChart.ChartType.LINE, 600,380);
    chart.addDataSet(DATA, '0000ff');
    chart.setXLabels(['1','7','14','21','28','35','42','49','56','63','70','77','84','100']);
    chart.setLeftLabels([0,250,500,750,1000]);
    //chart.setRightLabels([0,50,100]);
    //chart.setMinValue(-50);
    chart.decorate(element('line_chart'));
//log(DATA);
</code>
</div>

<h3>Transparency</h3>

Geoffrey Heywood notes the interesting fact that the premium rates used by the Amicable Society in its prospectus published in 1790 were based on the Breslau table and in the prospectus it _was produced in full_. Try phoning your Insurance Company and asking them if they can give you the basis of calculating your life insurance or annuity.

What I like by digging historical facts like this one, is that it first gives someone a chance to glimpse of the past, but also to compare it with to-day's practices. Besides of course that it give us a chance to reinforce programming skills in a rather more interesting way. 


<h3>Why all these?</h3>
