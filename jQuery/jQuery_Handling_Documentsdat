Most people new to jQuery are also actually new to Javascript. If you do not understand the basics of Javascript you can learn a bit of jQuery manipulation but you will not understand it! This series of articles would try and help you bridge the gap.

Another common mistake, is for developers to get to know jQuery, more than CSS. CSS has come a long way and it is possible to achieve with it a great lot. Enhance your presentation but always be aware of the potential CSS solution.
