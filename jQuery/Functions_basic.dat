There  numerous ways to create a function in JavaScript the simplest way, and the method which has been supported since its inception is as follows:

{{example:
function functionName(argname1, rgname2, ..., argname)
&#123;
   statement;
&#125;

}}

This is the most common type of function and sometimes is referred to as the _declarative/static_ format. 

The curly braces around the function's statements are a requirement, even if the function body consists of only one statement. Such developers do not like this approach and use Coffeescript or other variants, where a more simpler syntax can be used.

Functions are first class objects in JavaScript. What this means is that they behave like normal objects. You can assign methods to them or you can pass them around as arguments in other functions.

\begin{codeblock}
function returnValue() {
  var num = 10;
  return num;
}
anum=returnValue();
log(anum); // "10"
\end{codeblock}

## Arguments

A function can have zero or any number of \textit{arguments} or as they are sometimes called \textit{parameters}. Arguments can be of any type including other functions. One interesting way arguments are handled in JavaScript, is that if you omit an argument when you call a function, JavaScript will not generate an error, but assign a value of undefined to the function:

\begin{codeblock}
function testValues(numValue) {
    if (isNaN(numValue)) {
        return "error -- not a number";
    }
    numValue = numValue + 42;
    return numValue;
}

log(testValues(0/0));
log(testValues(13));
\end{codeblock}



##Return Values

All functions return a value. You can deliberately control what value is returned using the return statement. If you do no specify a  _return_ statement, an automatic value of
_undefined_ is turned instead. Note that whenever you call return, the function execution stops immediately, even if there is more code to be executed in the function. The following function returns a simple number value:

\begin{codeblock}
function returnValue() {
  var num = 10;
  return num;
}
anum=returnValue();
log(anum); // "10"
\end{codeblock}

What we have here is a function that we named {{field:returnValue()}}. When we invoke the function we assign the return value to anum and then we print it in the console. Comment out the
return num, in the example above and see that the return value logged will be shown as _undefined_.


#### Statements after the return statement

Anything declared after a return statement will not be executed and is ignored by the interpreter.

\begin{codeblock}
function returnValue() {
  var num = 10;
  return num;
  log('I am not executed!');
}
anum=returnValue();
log(anum); // "10"
\end{codeblock}

One reason you might have more than one return statement is if you want to terminate
and exit the function when a condition is met. In the following snippet of code, if a
condition isnâ€™t met in the function, the function terminates immediately; otherwise,
processing continues:

\begin{codeblock}
function testValues(numValue) {
if (isNaN(numValue)) {
   return "error -- not a number";
}
numValue = numValue + 42;
return numValue;
}

log(testValues(0/0));

log(testValues(13));
\end{codeblock}


###Passing Arguments by Value versus Reference

Values can be passed either _by value_ or _by reference_. This depends on if the variable is a _primitive_ or _reference type_. When you pass primitive data you cannot alter the value outside of the function; when you do the same with composite or reference data types, you can modify their original values, as shown in the example that follows:


\begin{codeblock}
var myNum = 10;
var myObj = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 12
};
function changeVals(num, obj) {
  num = 0;
  obj.name = "Changed";
}
changeVals(myNum, myObj);
log(myNum); // "10"
log(myObj.name); // "Changed"
\end{codeblock}

If the behavior of all data types were the same, you would expect the result to be one of 0 and Changed
or 10 and John . Because _Number_ is a primitive type and _Object_ is a reference type, they behave differently in this regard. To summarize, the primitive data types that are by value are:

<ul>
<li>Number</li>
<li>String</li>
<li>Boolean</li>
<li>null</li>
<li>undefined</li>
</ul>

and the reference types which are passed by _reference only_ are:

<ul>
<li>Object</li>
<li>Array</li>
<li>Function</li>
<li>Date</li>
<li>RegExp</li>
<li>Error</li>
</ul>




JavaScript functions can return more complex values such as objects. In the following example we return a more complex object. Study it a bit more carefully.

\begin{codeblock}
// Returning a complex object
function addTwoNumbers(x,y) {
   return {result:(x+y), originalX: x, originalY: y};
}
var sumResult = addTwoNumbers(9,3);
log("Sum: " + sumResult.result + "(comes from adding" + sumResult.
originalX + "and " + sumResult.originalY + ")");
// "Sum: 12 (comes from adding 9 and 3)
\end{codeblock}


### The function name

So far we have used functions with names. Consider a function specified as 
_function test () {....}_. JavaScript allows functions to be assigned to variables as follows:

\begin{codeblock}
var y = function (x1, x2, x3) {
    return (x1 * x2 * x3) ;
}

log(y(1,2,3));
log(y);
\end{codeblock}

If you obeserve closely, when we assigned the function to the variable _y_ we omitted the function name. This is called an _anonymous function_. Nothing stopping you from having a name, but once the function has been assigned, it cannot be be called on its own.

Now, what would happen, if we write it as follows?

\begin{codeblock}
var y = cubed;

log(y(1,2,3));
log(cubed(1,2,3));

function cubed(x1, x2, x3) {
    return (x1 * x2 * x3) ;
}
\end{codeblock}

What JavaScript does, it  _hoists_ all variables on the top of the code, before it executes, so in effect the function cubed is seen by the variable y. It also does the same with variables. In effect when a function with a name is created, JavaScript creates a variable with the function name and assigns the function definition as an anonymous function. 


### Function invocation

On all the examples above, we invoked i.e. called the function by using its name, for example _cubed(1, 2, 3)_. There are other ways to call a function. One way is by using the _()_. Another one is by using _call_ or _apply_.


<pre><code>
(function(){})();
</code>
</pre>

\begin{codeblock}
var y1 = cubed.call(this, 1,2,3);
var y2 = cubed.apply(null,[1,2,3]);

log(y1, y2);
\end{codeblock}



### Summary

So far we have examined how to define a function, pass it arguments and how to invoke functions. In the [next section](http://127.0.0.1/CodeIgniter/index.php/Blogs/tutorials/jQuery/Functions_102) we will discuss the _arguments_ object in a bit more detail.
