There are days that I itch to write, to express myself to tell the world my story, and yet I have never put this compulsion into action.

I am leaving Qatar and indirectly the protected security that it has provided me. The Company is gone bust. No other words for it. It is a miracle we managed to sustain it for three years and after pumping all these money the end of the end is here.

What's up next? No-one knows for sure, probably a job somewhere. No-one has guessed the graveness of the situation. They say people with a higher IQ get depressed more easily because they can grasp the gravity of the situation. I am depressed.

The first indications appeared in may, when Dr. Vasiliou was visiting Qatar. He made it very clear that he has no further money to invest.  True of false is immaterial.

Now, when the end comes people do look for scapegoats and I think I will be the one. Never mind, I will take what it takes, I feel strong and my children are made of the same genes am made and they should be strong too.

I have made arrangements to get a business visa to enter Qatar again.


Busy packing my goods, while Obama won his Nobel Prize! The man has done nothing yet, although I think he is a very good man, but he will end up pulling America down from a super-power to something like France or Germany. The real remaining super-power in the world now is China and truly intends to stay so.

Why Yiannis and Akis want me out of Qatar is a mystery yet to be unvailed. Surely is not their love for me. If I will be leaving on Tuesday it remains to be see.!

There is actually very little to pack in our home. My stamps or what remains, they can be sold in an emergency - and possibly lose a lot of money on the way for sustenance. Truly I have become a minimalist!
