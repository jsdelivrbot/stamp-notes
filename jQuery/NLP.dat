##NLP   

This is based on [Mark Watson's](http://www.markwatson.com/) pos tagger and using JavaScript. The JavaScript library can be downloaded at [jspos](http://code.google.com/p/jspos/). This includes a compressed lexicon provided by  Toby Rahilly.

Bonaparte has been as profuse in his disposal of the Imperial
diadem of Germany, as in his promises of the papal tiara of Rome.  The
Houses of Austria and Brandenburgh, the Electors of Bavaria and Baden,
have by turns been cajoled into a belief of his exclusive support towards
obtaining it at the first vacancy.  Those, however, who have paid
attention to his machinations, and studied his actions; who remember his
pedantic affectation of being considered a modern, or rather a second
Charlemagne; and who have traced his steps through the labyrinth of folly
and wickedness, of meanness and greatness, of art, corruption, and
policy, which have seated him on the present throne, can entertain little
doubt but that he is seriously bent on seizing and adding the sceptre of
Germany to the crowns of France and Italy.

By assigning this function to a variable, we effectively name-space our module, limiting the name to only one Object. this pattern is used extensively by all the JavaScript Libraries.

We can use two different methods to assign the properties to the Object and they both result to almost identical results:

The information shown in the box below maybe able to kill you. I believe that down the line the web will morph into an automated talking web, where distributed computing will become a reality by just pointing your browser to a URL. Is it possible with Javascript to perform genomics?
