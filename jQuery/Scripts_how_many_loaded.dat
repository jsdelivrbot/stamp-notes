<h2>Finding out how many scripts a page has loaded</h2>

Now and then you may need to find out how many scripts, your page has loaded. This is important especially when you dynamically add scripts onto a page. You can do this by capturing all the elements on a page that have the tag name __script__. You must then iterate through the array and capture only the scripts that have an src attribute (otherwise you will also capture nodes that are in-line scripts). However, before doing that let us explore the properties of a __script__ tag. To do that you simply capture the elements using __getElementsByTagName('scripts')__ and then iterate through the properties. Run this first in Chrome or FF before doing so in IE, as IE will also return a bunch of other non-standard properties.

<div  class="code-block console-wrap">
<div class="code-block code">
<pre style="background-image:none;border:none">
var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName('scripts');
for (var prop in document.scripts[0]) {
  log(prop + ': ' + document.scripts[0][prop]);
}
</pre>

</div>
<div  id ="msg" class="msg">
</div>
<div class="console"></div>
<button class="eval">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>


Now that we have seen the properties available at the instance of a script tag, we can now go back to our original aim and find out how many script tags we have loaded. We could if we wanted check if a particular script has loaded by checking through the return array of elements and splitting the __src__ string.


<div  class="code-block console-wrap">
<div class="code-block code">
<pre>
countNumFilesLoaded = function() {
  var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName('script');
  var count = 0;
  for (var i = 0, n = scripts.length; i < n; i++) {
    if (scripts[i].src) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
};

log('number of files loaded :  ' + countNumFilesLoaded());
</pre>
</div>
<div  id ="msg" class="msg">
</div>
<div class="console"></div>
<button class="eval">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>
