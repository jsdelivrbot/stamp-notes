<h2>Bubble Sort Part II - Performance</h2>
How are we going to time our estimates and would this produce any meaningful results? One way is to use big O notation when we derive some theoretical explanation of the problem.


We can place an upper-bound on the execution time of algorithms using O (big-oh) notation. An algorithm that runs in O(n2) time indicates that execution time increases with the square of the dataset size. For example, if we increase dataset size by a factor of ten, execution time will increase by a factor of 100. A more precise explanation of big-oh follows.

Assume that execution time is some function t(n), where n is the dataset size. The statement
t(n) = O(g(n))

implies that there exists positive constants c and n0 such that

t(n) <= c&middot;g(n)

function populateArrayRandom(n) {
  var newArray = new Array(n);
  for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    var x = Math.floor(Math.random() * n + 1);
    newArray[i] = x;
  }
  return newArray;

Some Computer Scientists like <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ola/papers/bubble.pdf">Owen Astrachan</a> preach that the Bubble Sort should be removed from Computer Science books and his argument goes something like this:

<blockquote>
Although
examples used in first year courses must be simple
enough to be understandable and complex enough to
be useful in a variety of situations, they should also
exemplify best practices so that these practices endure
after many of the details of a course have been forgotten.
</blockquote>

But he is right in claiming that Bubble Sort is a term that most Computer Science graduates will remember from their Algo classes! Personally I wouldn't like to see it removed as it conjures happy memories of a time that just studying algorithms was new and a much happier time of my life. In support for it also, it is a good example to use while learning the _syntax_ of a new language, which for most Computer Science students will be about the same time that they are learning the concept.

In any case in  practical situations the best sort to use is the
one provided by the standard (e.g., Python, Java, C, or C++)
libraries. However, we study sorts because general sorts
do not work in all situations and because sorting is a
simple illustration of algorithmic techniques. JavaScript provides a built-in method for sorting arrays and you can find more about it in ['Sorting Arrays in Javascript'](http://127.0.0.1/CodeIgniter/index.php/Blogs/tutorials/jQuery/Array_sort).
