\section{Spanish Sahara}

In June 1920, Spain issued postage stamps of its existing colony R\'io de Oro overprinted "LA AGUERA", and followed those up in 1922 with a series portraying King Alfonso XIII and inscribed "SAHARA OCCIDENTAL / LA AGUERA".

These were superseded in 1924 by stamps of Spanish Sahara. The stamps of La AgUera are not rare, typically costing about one US$ either used or unused, but because of the small population (probably less than 1,000 persons) and short period of validity, non-philatelic uses on cover are likely to be hard to find.
