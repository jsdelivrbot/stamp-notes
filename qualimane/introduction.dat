\chapter{Introduction}

Quelimane was a district of the Portuguese colony of Mozambique in eastern Africa. The Portuguese had since the 16th century established themselves in Mozambique. When Mozambique was awarded to Portugal at the 1885 Berlin conference where the colonial powers divided their respective spheres of influence in Africa it was a prerequisite for continued recognition of territorial claims that effective colonial rule would be established. The Portuguese had little resources available to actually do so and thus large parts of Mozambique were  transferred to chartered companies for further development – the Mozambique Company and the Nyassa Company. In parallel the colonial administration was modernized. In 1894 districts were formed each with a governor, reporting to a high commissioner who in turn reported to the Cortes – the Portuguese parliament in Lisbon. With the formation of these districts elements of the colonial administration and judiciary system came to be organized on district level – the postal administration being one of them.

In 1894 the district of Zambezia was formed. At the time only parts of Zambezia were under effective control of the Portuguese. When in 1902 most of Zambesia was ‘pacified’ the Zambesia district was split into the districts of Quelimane and Tete. Quelimane is the most densely populated district of Mozambique. Due to the quality of the soil, the suitable climate and the availability of irrigation from the tributaries of the Zambezi River Quelimane has become an agricultural district with a variety of crops. Quelimane is the district were in colonial times the ‘prazo’ system was most extensively used: land was leased to Portuguese settlers for a number of years giving the settlers exclusive right over the land. A system that led to the development of large plantations – and to forced labor and expropriation of the indigenous farmers. Economic development was furthermore put in the hands of private companies such as the Zambesia Company. The capital of Quelimane is also called Quelimane – a port founded in the times of the Arab trade in Mozambique before the arrival of the Portuguese and taken over by the Portuguese in the 16th century.

Currently the district of Quelimane is the Zambezia province of Mozambique.

Quelimane has issued stamps in 1914. The first set are overprints issued for the new currency that was introduced in Mozambique in 1912. It is interesting to note that for this overprint stamps of the 1898 Vasco da Gama issue for all of Portuguese Africa and stamps of Macau and Timor have been used. Later in 1914 a set of definitives was issued of the Ceres type common to Portugal and the Portuguese colonies.

The stamps of Quelimane have been used until 1920 when they were superseded by the general issues for Mozambique.
