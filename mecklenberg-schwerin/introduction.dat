# The Stamps and Postal History of Mecklenberg-Schwerin


The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was a territory in Northern Germany held by the House of Mecklenburg residing at Schwerin. It was a sovereign member state of the German Confederation and became a federated state of the North German Confederation and finally of the German Empire in 1871.

It bordered to the North on the Baltic Sea to the east on the Prussion province of
Pomerania, to the south-east on Mecklenburg-Strelitz, to the south on the Prussian province of Brandenburg, to the south-west on Hanover---with the Elbe Rier forming the approximate boundary---and to the west on the dutchies of Lauenbrg and Ratzeburg, belonging to Denmark and Mecklenburg-Strelitz respectively. Mecklelnburg-Schwerin
had small enclavess on foreign territories, namely Ahrensberg in Mecklcenburg-Strelitz
and Netzeband-Schneberf in the Prussian province of Brandenburg. In 1865 Lauenburg, in 1866 Hanover became Prussian provinces, so that from then on Mecklenburg-Schwerein was almost surrounded by Prussia.

With only eight types printed the postage stamps of Mecklenberg Schwerin, can easily be collected. More specialized collections will need patience and a bit of funds. A postal history collection can also be put together fairly quickly, now that almost every auction is on the web. There is sufficient Literature available
about the stamps and envelopes of Mecklenberg-Schwerin,
but it is all in German. The
stanard books are still those of H. Kl\"ojtzsch
about the adhesives and postmarks (1894)
and of C. Lindcnberg about the envelopes
(1892). Nwwer research, mainly scattered in
articles and notes in German philatelic
magazines, providing hardly any important
new facts. The collcetor who wants to study
Mecklenbergg-Schwerin needs to be able to
read German, although some specialized
catalogs, such as that of the Old German
States b.v n. Grobe (l959), will to a large
extent also be understandable to those who
do not know German.

## Introduction of Postage Stamps

Mecklenburg-Schwerin introduced Postage
Stamps and Postal Envelopes on July 1,
1856. No other kinds of adhesives or stationery
were in use.

The Postal Rates which were in force at the time of introduction of postage stamps depended on weight and partly on distance.

\begin{description}

\item [Domestic Mail] In the domestic service, letters paid for each loth 1s up to 3 mi., 1 1/2s above 3 to 6mi, and 3s above 6mi.

\item [Printed matter and samples]  were 1/2s up to 1 loth and one quarter of the letter rate above 1 loth and up to 4 loth, they had to be sent by parcel post.

\item[Registration] The registration fee was 2s, and for return receipts the single letter fee had to be paid. Delivery fee was 1/2s. 

\end{description}

On July 1, 1863 a new rate schedule came into force. Now letters paid for the frist loth 1s up to 5mi., 2s above 5 mi to 10mi and 3s above 10 mi.; heavier letters up to 15 loth paid double these rates. City mail paid a reduced fee, 1/2s up to 1 loth and 1s over 1 to 15 loth.

For rather curious reason that the administration wanted to keep the colour of the stamps to those of the Dutchy flag,   the postal administration
had to keep the number of denominations of the postage stamps down to three.
This constraint led, to serious difficulties, as the main rates would have made at least eight denominations necessary, 1/2s, 1s, 1 1.2s, 1 3/4s, 2s, 3s, 3 1.4s and 5s.

Actually only three denominations were issued 1s, 3s and 5s. The problem was solved by an ingenious idea: the lowest denomination, 1s, was printed in such a way that it actually consisted of four parts each 1/4s worth, so that it was really a 4/4s stamp.

The use of stamps was not obligatory and letters could be mailed at the same rates
paid as wel1 as unpaid, to be paid by the addressee. This explains that between October
1, 1864 and December 31, 1867, only about one third of all letters and printed matter, was franked with postage stamps or sent in postal enveloes, while for two thirds postage was paid in cash, either by, the sender or by the addressee. The delivery fee had to be paid in cash. Incidentally, as in Mecklenburg-Schwerin, more letters were sent in postal envelopes than franked with adhesive stamps.


## Design of the Postage Stamps

The design of the stamps of MEcklenberg-Schwerin were simple but attractive. The main design was a shield of arms, showing a bull's head, with a crown resting at the top of the shield. For the 3s and 5s postage stamps, this was enclosed in a square frame, consisting of simple lines with FREIMARKE at top, MECKLENBB, at left, SCHWERIn at right and SCHILLINGE at bottom; the figure of value was in the four corners. The design of the lowest denomination, 1s actually consisted of four identical 1/4s stamps which due to their small size showed only the bull's head in the center. The inscriptions were the same, but the value indication at bottom read SCHILLING in the singular.

In 1864, it was decided to remove the dotted background on the 1.4s stamp, as it interfered with the legibility of the cancellation. The changed design shows the bull's head on a colourless ground.

Apparently the idea f the dividable 1s stamp originated with the postal inspector Fl\"ugge of Schwerin, who probably also proposed the designs of teh stamps. The envelope stamps were fashioned after the nevelope stamps of Prussia, but the head was replaced by the shield of arms--crown aboe a shield with bull's head---simialr to that of the adhesives, with the legend GROSSH. MECKLENB:SCHWERIN at top.

## Dies and Printing

All dies and printing material for the adhesives and envelope stamps were made by the Prussian State Printing Works at Berlin which also took care of the complete manufacturing process of stamps and envelopes. Typography was used for the adhesives and typography combined with embossing for the envelope stamps.

## Paper

The paper of all issues, adhesives as well as enveloped was wove and machine-made. Frequently the texture of the paper is apparent through a more or less distinct mesh.
