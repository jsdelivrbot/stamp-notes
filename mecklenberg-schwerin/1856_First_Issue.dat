# 1856 First Postage Stamp Issue

The first stamps, as we have already
stated, were issued on July 1st, 1856.
They were printed at the Prussian State
Printing Office, in Berlin, on white wove
paper and were issued imperforate. The
design of the 1 schilling consisted of
four small stamps of Y\ schilling each
in two rows of two, the combined four
being about 21 mm. square. The design
on each of these four quarters shows a
bull's head (or that of a buffalo according
to some writers) the Arms of Mecklenburg,
on a dotted ground, heraldically
representing a field d'or. This was enclosed
by a square frame inscribed
"SCHILLING" at the base and "MECKLENB.
SCHWERIN FRIEMARKE"
on the other three sides, the numerals
of value being in the angles. The 3 and
5 schillinge are alike in design and
show a bull's head on a dotted ground
within a shield, surmounted by a grand
ducal coronet on an uncolored ground.
Around this centerpiece is a square
frame being inscriptions similar to those
on the lowest denomination except that
the word at base is "SCHILLINGE."
The numerals in the angles are, of
course, "3" and "5" respectively.

The sheets consisted of 120 stamps
arranged in twelve rows of ten. According
to the late Mr. W. A. S. Westoby
"the 480 electrotypes for the J4 schilling
were arranged in groups of four in
two rows of two, 1}4 mm. distance from
each other, and 1^4 mm. between each
group." Other writers state that the
small electrotypes were placed an equal
distance apart horizontally and vertically
so that each was virtually a separate
54 schilling stamp. The electrotypes for
the 3 and 5 schillinge values were spaced
about 2 mm. apart. The rows were
numbered in the margins at each side
from 1 to 12 respectively. Three deliveries
of these stamps were made by
the Prussian State Printing Office viz.
