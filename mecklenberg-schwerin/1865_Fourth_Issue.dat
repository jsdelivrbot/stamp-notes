# 1865 Fourth Issue


In September, 1865, the 3 schillinge appeared
rouletted ll 1/? like the other
values. The original plate of 1856 was
used so that the stamps have smaller
margins than those of the 5sch of the
last issue which were printed in sheets
of 100. A supply consisting of 800
sheets, or 96,000 stamps was delivered
on August 16th. There was little room
for the roulette lines, the size of the completed stamps being 23mm. square.
When a new supply was required in 1867
the plate was reconstructed so that it
contained 100 stamps like that of the
4/4sch and 5sch. These were so spaced
that the stamps now measure a trifle
more than 24 mm. square. Two printings,
each of 20,000 stamps, were made
and these were delivered on July llth
and August 24th, 1867, respectively.
