# The Third Issue

A notice issued by the Post Office under
date September 30th, 1864, informed
the public that as soon as the stock of
5sch blue was exhausted a new issue
would be made printed in brown, and
that the dotted ground in the 4/4 schilling
stamps had been suppressed. The
actual date of issue of these two new
varieties does not seem to be known for,
though the official circular referred to
above is dated Sept. 30th, a delivery of
the osch bistre was made on July 15th,
1864, while the first lot of the 4/4sch was
delivered on August 10th. These stamps
were printed in sheets of 100 in ten
rows of ten instead of 120 as formerly.
The dates and quantities of the postage were given by Poole as:
\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Date             &Sheets  &Value  &Stamps\\
July 15,  1864.  &100     &5sch &10,000\\
Aug. 10,  1864.  &4,000   &4/4sch &400,000\\
March 20, 1865.  &150     &5sch &15,000\\
Oct. 20,  1865.  &150     &5sch &15,000\\
Jan. 9,   1866.  &5,000   &4/4sch &500,000\\
Jan. 26,  1867.  &60      &5sch &6,000\\
Feb. 23,  1867.  &2,000   &4/4sch &200,000\\
June 11,  1867.  &100     &5sch &10,000\\
Aug. 24,  1867.  &1,200   &4/4sch &120,000\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

It will thus be seen that altogether
1,220,000 4/4sch stamps were printed and
56,000 of the 5sch.

The 5sch is known on a distinctly
thick paper and as this is little rarer than
the normal variety it would seem that
more than one of the supplies mentioned
above were on this paper. Both values
may be found in quite a number of
shades.

The specialist can sub-divide
the ordinary paper into two varieties
one having a close texture like that used
in 1856 and the other having a coarse
web like that used for the issue of the
rouletted 4/4sch original type, made in
1864.
