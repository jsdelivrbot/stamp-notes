# Remainders

In 1866, the German States stamps for the Kingdom of Hannover were replaced by those of the Kingdom of Prussia, and later by those of the North German Postal Union.
Mecklenburg-Schwerin having joined the North German Confederation its
special stamps were superseded on January 1st, 1868, by the general issue for the
Confederation. Late in the same year or early in 1869 the remainders were
purchased from the Post Office by Mr.G. Schnelle, of Schwerin. These consisted
of the following:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
2sch lilac,   &15,000 stamps\\
3sch yellow,  &18,800 stamps\\
5sch bistre,  &3,000 stamps\\
4/4sch red,   &36,500 stamps\\
\end{tabular}


The price paid for the lot was $75.00
and the purchaser offered them wholesale
at the following rates :

\begin{tabular}{ll}
1sch (4/4) red, &$2.40 per 100.\\
2sch lilac,     &$2.40 per 100.\\
3sch yellow,    &$2.40 per 100.\\
\end{tabular}
