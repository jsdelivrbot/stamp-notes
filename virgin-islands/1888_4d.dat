\chapter{1888 4d. Issue} 

In July 1888 the only provisional stamp of the Virgin Islands made its appearance, when 2000 copies of the 1/- stamp of 1868, with the coloured border, were sent to Antigua to be hand-stamped in violet. The hand-stamp was applied separately to each stamp, and occassionally the surcharge appears doubled.

The issue appears to have been necessary owing to the supply of the 4d. stamps, sent out the year previously, becoming low, the consignment of the regular stamps probably having been a small one.

In 1890, the Leeward Islands General Stamp Act of that year, provided the introduction of uniform postage stamps for the Leeward Islands generally, including the Virgin Islands, and, from that date, Leeward Islands stamps were used in the Virgin islands concurrently with the distinctive local stamps, which remained valid if postage originated in the Virgin Islands. The Leeward Islands stamps were used were the issues of 1890, the Jubilee issue of 1897, and the surcharges of 1902, and although the Virgin Islands resumed the issue of their special stamps in 1899, the general Leeward Islands were still valid and available at the Virgin islands Post Offices. Virgin islands postmarks are therefore often found on the Leeward Islands stamps.
