\chapter{1866 The One Penny Value} 

On November 26, 1866, a consignment consisting of 22,000 1d. stamps, in separate parcels of 20,000 and 2,000 was despatched from London, and the stamps were issued in the Virgin Islands in December of that year. The parcel containing 2,000 stamps was sent to Sir
Arthur Rumbold, the then President Administrator of the Virgin islands, and the larger
quantity direct to St. Thomas for distribution to the Islands. St. Thomas was a kind of G.P.O. for the West Indies at that time, where a British Postal Agency was established
which dealt with incoming and local mails. It is possible that the packet sent to Rumbold was to be used for official use. Brown noted that he was unable to trace the exact reason, but I am of the opinion being the President and Administrator could have use for these for official mail that required postage stamps.


The stamps were printed in shades of dark green in sheets of 25 subjects, five rows of five, and were perforated 12 by a single line machine. The paper is mostly stout white, without watermark, and they also exist on a yellowish or so-called toned paper, these being much the scarcer. 

A scarce variety of this stamp exists perforated 15 x 12, and its origins remain unknown.

The perforation 15 machine was not used until the next consignment of 1d. stamps was
sent out from London in July 1868, and it is possible that the printers, Messrs. Waterlow
and Sons Ltd., had on hand a few sheets of the first issue, which were only perforated
12 vertically, and in order not to waste these, it may have been convenient to complete the
perforation horizontally with the 15 machine, and include them in the second consignment.
The standard catalogue states that the Id. perf. 15 stamps were all printed in small sheets
of 12 stamps, but this is incorrect, as I possess a nearly complete sheet of 18 stamps, with
top and side margins, part of a presumed sheet of 20, numbers 11 and 16 only being missing,
and to which I shall refer presently.

It is possible that the compound perforated stamps, in sheets of 2-5, were included in the
first consignment of the 1d. perf 15 stamps. Postally used copies are known, and in
Stanley Gibbons Monthly Journal, Vol. XXII, page 200, the publishers, referring to the sale
of the "Pelham" collection in 1914, and the Id. compound perforation say:â€”
"In this collection we have this real rarity with a genuine postmark A13, between bars.
This is the first copy we have ever heard of in a used condition, and proves that at least one
sheet with the compound perforation was sent to the Islands."
I show an unused copy of this stamp, No. 23 on the sheet of the first issue, in the green
shade, and Mr. Yardley had another copy, No. 16 on the sheet, of which I show a photograph,
which, however, is imperforate at the left side, with a wide left margin.

I also show a postally used copy, being No. 1 on the sheet, with A13 postmark between
bars, similar to the copy recorded above, but which is also imperforate at left, Jike Mr.
Yardley's unused copy, but without the wide margin, and which points to the probability
that the whole of the left margin of this particular sheet was imperforate.
All three of these stamps have been expertised by the Expert Committee of the Royal
Philatelic Society,
I do not overlook the fact that the AI3 cancellation was in use in the Virgin Islands
certainly until 1887-89, as I have copies of the Jd. yellow and Id. carmine of 1883-84,
and the 4d. chestnut and I/- brown of 1887-89 with this cancellation, but as the first used
copy of the compound perforation with the A13 postmark was not recorded until 1914,
it seems most unlikely that a copy of this stamp, which has always been scarce, was "postmarked
to oblige," seeing that the cancellation A13 had then been out of use for nearly
30 years, and was probably destroyed.

The consignment sent out from London on June 6, 1868, consisted of 1,000 stamps of
each of the 1d., 4d., and 6d. values, and 2,000, in two packets of 1,000 stamps each of the 1/- value. All were perforated 15. As already stated, I am able to show a mint block of 18 of the Id. value, which I believe
to be a complete sheet less two stamps, and I also possess a complete mint sheet, less one
stamp, No. 16, of the 6d. value of this consignment, with full margins, and I find that the
measurements of these two sheets are practically identical, viz. 109 mm. horizontally,
and 98 mm. vertically, which rather suggests that they were printed and perforated at the
same time, a further point being that the perforating pins of the 15 machine have failed to
perforate in many instances, not only on these two sheets, but also on sheets of the 4d.
and I/- values, which were issued at the same time. The probability exists that this defective
machine was discarded after 1868, and all subsequent printings of the Id. value were
perforated by a new machine on the well-known small sheets or panes of 12 stamps.
This Id. perf 15 stamp is a different transfer from the first issue, and is also in a larger
setting, measuring 3 mm. more horizontally, and vertically in proportion.
I do not overlook the fact that my block of 18, having no bottom margin, discloses the
possibility that the sheet may have been one of 25 subjects, but I am inclined to the view
that fresh transfers of the Id. and 6d. values, in sheets of 20 each were made, and that the
stamps were printed and perforated at the same time.
There must have been a proof sheet of the Id. value in this setting, as I possess an imperforate
proof, which is number 15 on the sheet.
A period of well over two years passed before any further consignment of the Id. value
was sent out, viz. on October 25, 1870, and it seems probable that these and all subsequent
sendings were all printed in the small sheets or panes of 12 stamps, these being despatched
in nine different consignments, the last being in September 1876, and it is certain that
several different transfers were made.
I have identified at least six different transfers in these small sheets or panes, in addition
to the first perf 15 issue already mentioned, in sheets of 20, and which I have labelled
A, B, C, D, E, and F.

I also have many other single copies, showing lithographic flaws which I cannot yet place,
so there are certainly more, although, as there were four separate sendings from October
1870 to September 1871, possibly some of these were from the same transfer.
I am showing several pages of the unplaced Id. perf 15 transfer varieties, with written
description of the lithographic flaws of each stamp, in the wall frames, and you will notice
that, in some cases, two copies are shown which confirm the constant nature of the varieties,
and it will only be possible to definitely fix the position of these transfer varieties on their
respective sheets or panes when pairs or blocks are available, and in view of the scarcity
of these items, it is likely to prove^ a long and difficult job before anything approaching
completion is reached.
Whether these settings of 12 stamps constitute a sheet, or whether they represent panes,
being part of a sheet of two or more settings has not yet been discovered.
It should be noted, however, that the stamps of Nevis, printed about the same time, and
by the same printers, exist in proof sheets of four horizontal panes of 12 stamps each, and
it is possible that a similar method was adopted for certain printings of these Virgin Islands
Id. stamps.

I have been unable to trace whether any imperforate proofs of these small sheets or panes
exist. The stamps were printed in shades of blue-green and yellow-green, on white wove
and toned papers, and there are wide and close settings, the wide setting measuring 62 mm.
horizontally, and 97 vertically, and the close setting 60 mm. horizontally and 93 mm.
vertically.
