\chapter{1866 The One Penny Value} 

On November 26, 1866, a consignment consisting of 22,000 1d. stamps, in separate parcels of 20,000 and 2,000 was despatched from London, and the stamps were issued in the Virgin Islands in December of that year. The parcel containing 2,000 stamps was sent to Sir
Arthur Rumbold, the then President Administrator of the Virgin islands, and the larger
quantity direct to St. Thomas for distribution to the Islands. St. Thomas was a kind of G.P.O. for the West Indies at that time, where a British Postal Agency was established
which dealt with incoming and local mails. It is possible that the packet sent to Rumbold was to be used for official use. Brown noted that he was unable to trace the exact reason, but I am of the opinion being the President and Administrator could have use for these for official mail that required postage stamps.


The stamps were printed in shades of dark green in sheets of 25 subjects, five rows of five, and were perforated 12 by a single line machine. The paper is mostly stout white, without watermark, and they also exist on a yellowish or so-called toned paper, these being much the scarcer. 

A scarce variety of this stamp exists perforated 15 x 12, and its origins remain unknown.
