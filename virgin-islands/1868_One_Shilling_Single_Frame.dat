The use of the 1s. stamps must have been slight, as the supplies of 1867 and 1868 lasted till 1888, as 2500 1s. stamps were used for the 4d.surcharge. (Philatelic Record August, 1888). There was no further supply of the 1s. until in 1889 when stamps of the same design, but printed by Messrs. De La Rue \& Co. from one plate in shades of brown or chocolate and watermarked  Crown CA were put in circulation.
