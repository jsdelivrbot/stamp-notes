\subsection{The Missing Virgin}

In the English language press the first record of the variety was reported in
the \textit{Philatelic Record}


Virgin Islands. 

Our Gallic friends have a well-known and
of late rather hackneyed saying, that "in cases of mystery it is advisable to seek for the cause among the fairer sex;" but the
expression has such a direct bearing upon a particular stamp which
has caused us much mystified astonishment that, as it really does concern a vanishing lady, we are constrained to cry, " Cherchez la femme /" We were shown recently the one shilling stamp of the 1867 issue of Virgin Islands with single outer
line of colour, but, alas ! without the lady
herself. As is well known, this stamp is printed with frame and background in a crimson shade, and has an upright female
figure in the centre, printed in black, emblematic of the name of the Islands, sur- rounded by a white halo of glory. In the unused specimen that we saw there is absolutely no trace of the Virgin, and a vacant spot remains revealed, leaving a white
patch in the centre of the design, broken at the edges with rays branching into the crimson-lined background, and, alas ! wasting
their sweetness on the desert air. The solution of the mystery is, without doubt, that as a result of considerable carelessness the
overprinting in the second colour has been forgotten, but so
different is the appearance of the stamp that it seems hardly
credible such an oversight could have escaped the attention of the most casual of printers, unless perchance two sheets adhered
to each other after the first printing, the upper one alone receiving the second impression. Even this supposition would, however, admit great carelessness in counting the sheets. The paper and
perforation, as far as we could see, in a cursory examination, corresponded with the ordinary specimens ; and judging from the
fact of its appearance in a small collection, there seems every
reason to believe that the "surcharge" has been inadvertently
omitted, and that it is one of a sheet that has never been smiled upon by its better half!

Is., crimson, issue of 1867, with the overprint of central figure of the Virgin omitted.
