(Whom God Preserve), who recently had arrived from St. Eustatius (a small island northwest of St. Kitts), to Colonial America and addressed to "Messrs.

3	1776 Ship Letter from Tortola, an interesting personal letter written by a person who had just arrived there from Europe about the voyage, sent to a "Writer to the Signet" in Edinburgh, Scotland, carried by Captain Pacock of the ship "Aurora", two-line "Bristol/Ship Lre" handstamp applied on reaching port, London Bishop mark transit and ms. rate "in all 11" including 1p master's gratuity and 10p inland rate to Edinburgh, small piece of flap missing in opening, otherwise very fine; the sender writes more like a tourist than a businessman describing a terrible storm west of the coast of Africa including six hours of hurricane, and a description of various islands that he saw including Grand Canary, Antigua, St. Kitts and Nevis, as well as Tortola; a rare letter being the earliest recorded cover from the Virgin Islands that was carried within the postal system.

SOLD for $525.00.} 

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/4.jpg}{
4	1787 "Tortola" straight line handstamp, Type 1, the first large size handstamp with star ornamentation at sides, applied to the reverse of folded letter datelined "Tortola, 21st June, 1787", posted to London "pr Packet" and forwarded within the city, rated "1/-" with no extra inland rate being to London, backstamped, a personal letter by a resident of Tortola speaking of deaths in the family, some separation along folds in the letter which can be reinforced to maintain its very fine appearance. This is one of the most important covers in the Peter McCann collection of Virgin Islands Postal History and a key item in the postal history of this country. 1787 is the first year that a post office was established on Tortola. The monthly packet boat service that carried this cover was instituted at the same time. This cover is the earliest cover from the Tortola Post Office and the only known example with this first large "Tortola" straight line handstamp.  Est. 7,500-10,000 
SOLD for $7,250.00.} 

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/5.jpg}{
5	1798 "Tortola" straight line handstamp, Type 2, on front of folded letter to Ireland, originally rated "1/8", which would have been correct to London, but re-rated "2/2" to include the additional inland 6p to Ireland, datelined "Decem. 23rd, 1798", long personal family letter that relates the interesting postal fact that the packet that served Tortola left England on the first Monday of the month, cover is fresh and attractive, very fine; a very scarce marking of which only five examples are known.  Est. 2,000-3,000 
SOLD for $2,000.00.} 

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/6.jpg}{
6	"Tortola/Oct 7 1800" straight line datestamp, Type 3C, well struck example with date changed by hand from the 7th to the 23rd, applied in transit to front of folded merchant's letter datelined "St. Kitts, Octbr. 17th, 1800", sent "Per Packet" to London, rated "1/8" and backstamped on November 26th, portion of backflap missing in opening and marking is over a normal file fold, otherwise very fine; this is a scarce type of marking with larger "Tortola" than is usually seen, in this early period it is very rare being only recorded in the months of September and October of 1800 (a similar, but not identical, marking was used in 1839-48, also scarce), this is the only example in the McCann collection and there was no example in the J.L. Fredrick collection.  Est. 1,000-1,500 
SOLD for $1,450.00.} 

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/7.jpg}{
7	"Tortola/19 Sep 1802" straight line datestamp, Type 3A, a well struck example applied in transit on front of folded merchant's letter to Amsterdam, Netherlands, datelined "St. Thomas, 18 July 1803", and rated "Post paid 5/11" in light manuscript for a double-rate letter per British packet, red London "Paid" date stamp on the front and Foreign Office transit on the reverse, docketing indicated it was not received until November 18th, clean and attractive though left flap of letter was separated and re-attached with wax seals for filing by the recipient, otherwise very fine; a very rare letter illustrating the great length of time required for correspondence during this period; this is the earliest known cover through the Virgin Islands to a foreign country other than the United States.  Est. 1,000-1,500 
SOLD for $675.00.}

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/8.jpg}{
8	"Tortola/Jun 26 1804" straight line datestamp, Type 3A, an unusually well struck example of this early marking, on front of folded cover to London, rated "1/10" per packet and the new 1801 inland rate of 10p to London, mended tear to cover not affecting the marking, very fine appearance; while this marking is the more common size listed under the broad category of Type 3A, it is the very scarce early variety with month before day (day usually comes before month), it is only recorded between 1801-04 and this is the only example in the McCann collection, there also was no example in the Fredrick collection.  Est. 500-750 
SOLD for $1,150.00.}


\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/9.jpg}{
9	1805 Ship letter, folded cover sent on October 12th per docketing, which places the sender, Robert Longhurst, with Captain Hegenbottom in Tortola, to the British island of Guernsey, "Ship Letter/Deal" double oval handstamp, London transit of February 1806, double rate letter re-rated "2/-" from "1/6" as the inland rate from London to Guernsey had increased from 4p to 7p in 1805, very fine; nice usage of a private ship rather than the usual mail packet to a scarcer destination.  Est. 500-750 
SOLD for $400.00.} 

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/10.jpg}{
10	"Tortola/1 Jan 1806" straight line datestamp, Type 3A, an excellent strike on front of folded letter from Antigua, strangely datelined "Antigua, 30 Decbr. 1804", a year early (this is probably in error and should be 1805 as the writer first speaks of the ending of hostilities between the British and the French and the "loss of Dear Nelson", referring to Admiral Horatio Nelson, who was killed in the battle of Trafalgar in October 1805), carried to Tortola for the packet to England and endorsed "by the Leewd Isld Packet", rated "2/-" and backstamped London on February 7th, a fresh and very fine early letter showing the use of Tortola as the departure point for mail from the Leeward Islands.  Est. 750-1,000 
SOLD for $1,400.00.} 

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/11.jpg}{
11	1807 Inbound interisland folded letter, attractive letter written at Antigua on February 23, 1807 and endorsed "By the Packet", receiving a lovely strike of the scarce "St. Kitts/Feb 28, 1807" large fleuron c.d.s., manuscript "Tortola Received March 6th 1807" on the reverse, rated "3 bits", double rate letter "8d", minor stain at top, otherwise very fine; an exceptionally scarce cover as very little inbound mail of this period has survived.

SOLD for $550.00.} 

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/12.jpg}{
12	"Tortola/11 Apr 1808" straight line datestamp, Type 3A, quite clear strike on front of folded letter from British occupied St. Croix, datelined "St. Croix, 16 January 1808" and carried to Tortola for passage to Scotland by the monthly packet, rated "2/4" for 1/1 packet rate to England plus 1/3 inland rate to Scotland, London transit on reverse, edgewear and light soiling but very fine for the period and usage; this is one of two letters known from this British occupation period, since this is very shortly after the occupation began, in his letter to his sons he relates the events of the occupation and notes that he is responsible for some of the provisions of the occupying forces (particularly drink), he also is concerned about what his children write in letters as the mail is censored, a rare and desirable letter reflecting important historical events.  Est. 1,000-1,500 
SOLD for $600.00.} 

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/13.jpg}{
13	"Tortola/26 May 1808" straight line datestamp, Type 3A, clear strike on folded disinfected cover (right flap missing) to London, this cover shows the typical monthly packet passage with ms. "2/-" rate that would have come through Falmouth to London, this makes the disinfection all that more unusual as the mail packet would not have been a ship normally subject to quarantine and disinfection, very fine and attractive cover; not a great deal is known about disinfection in England, but it was normal for the mail through Falmouth to be disinfected at the St. Just Pool station, this cover shows scorching on the reverse with a distinct silhouette of the tongs used to hold it over the fire where disinfection substances, such as sulfur, were burned, this is a much less common form of disinfection as sprinkling with vinegar which was the usual method, a very rare disinfected cover from the Caribbean as most disinfected mail originated in Europe or the Mediterranean.  Est. 3,000-4,000 
SOLD for $2,000.00.}

14	1809 Inbound folded letter, from Liverpool with rimless mileage c.d.s. of that city on the reverse, endorsed "p Pact. Pd." for service on the Falmouth packet prepaid, manuscript rate "P2/1" and "1 bit" due for local assessment on arrival, manuscript "Tortola Recd. 6th March 1809", fresh and attractive letter, very fine.

15	1812 Inbound folded letter from England datelined "Liverpool, Nov 21st, 1812", carried by favor on the ship "Booth" per instructions on the front as well as note inside "per Ship 'Booth'/for Barbadoes", put in the post at Antigua receiving scarce "Antigua/Feb 21" large fleuron c.d.s., manuscript "Recd. Tortola Feby 24th 1813" on the reverse, rated "2 bits" and marked "4d" for the inter-colonial rate, fresh and attractive with only minor stains at top edge, very fine; a rare inbound cover with very scarce early marking of Antigua.  Est. 500-750 
SOLD for $900.00.}

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/16.jpg}{
16	1812 Inbound folded letter, exceptionally fresh letter sent by Falmouth packet to Road Town, Tortola, light Liverpool mileage c.d.s. on the reverse, endorsed "p Paqt. Pd." for prepaid service, manuscript "P 2/3" reflecting the rate change of July 1812 for this service, plus "1 bit" due for local assessment, manuscript "Recd. Tortola Feby 24th 1813", extremely fine and a lovely example of this packet service to the Virgin Islands.  Est. 200-300 
SOLD for $90.00.} 

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/17.jpg}{
17	1815 "Packet-Letter" straight line handstamp, a wonderfully clear strike of this unusual marking, applied to the front of folded letter, backstamped London and datelined "Tortola 13th July 1815", manuscript "p packet" at bottom left indicates this letter was intended to go by the the normal Falmouth monthly packet, but not receiving the normal Tortola date marking that was usually applied to such letters, this packet marking, apparently applied at London, was put on to indicate what type of mail this was and how it should be rated, usual "2/2" manuscript designation, very minor staining to cover, which otherwise is quite fresh and very fine; a rare usage that is clearly out of the ordinary for transatlantic covers of this period.  Est. 500-750 
SOLD for $425.00.} 

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/18.jpg}{
18	"Tortola/21 Aug 15" straight line datestamp, Type 3A var., an incredibly clear strike of this postmark showing the variety of only two numerals in the year date, applied to the front of a folded disinfected cover, cover carried by the monthly packet and rated "2/2" to London where backstamped, disinfection was probably done at the station at St. Just Pool where mail through Falmouth was believed to have been disinfected, cover has two large parallel disinfection slits and light stains where sprinkled with vinegar, an extremely fine cover; incredibly rare as very few covers from the West Indies are known disinfected, particularly in this premium condition.

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/19.jpg}{
19	"Tortola/4 Nov 1815" straight line datestamp, Type 3A, a clear and well struck example of a decidedly scarce multiple rate cover for a heavy enclosure, posted to London with manuscript "p Packet" endorsement, believed to have originated in St. Kitts but no contemporaneous notations to confirm this, rate marked in manuscript "2 Oz. 17/4", backstamped London on December 18th, very minor edge wrinkles which is entirely normal for such a large missive, very fine; this high rate represents an eight times rate of the 1sh/2p packet fee plus eight times the 1/- inland rate from Falmouth to London, such highly rated covers are extremely scarce as this is just slightly less than \pound1, a very substantial sum at this time.  Est. 1,000-1,500 
SOLD for $725.00.} 

\ph[80%]{../virgin-islands/20.jpg}{
20	1816 Ulverstone ship letter from Tortola, this folded letter with enclosure is from the well-known correspondence to Thomas Watters at Kendal, Westmoreland in England, usually his letters were sent by packet via Falmouth in the south of England, but this was sent by private ship which made port at the rarely used, but closer, port of Ulverstone in the north of England, this port had no ship-letter handstamp so it was written in red and the "Ulverstone/261" mileage handstamp was applied at bottom left, manuscript "1 Oz" because of heavy enclosure, "2/4" rate crossed out, and re-rated "2/8" and initialed "R.T." by Robert Town, the postmaster, the packet rate would have been 2/4 times four or 9/4, which may explain the use of a private ship rather than the packet service, normal folds and wear for a letter of this size, otherwise very fine; an interesting addition is that this was a letter requesting insurance on the writer's ship, "Harriet", which unknown to the writer, had foundered two days previously in route to the United States, this is the only known ship letter of this port, and especially interesting being from the Virgin Islands.

21	"Tortola/15 Sep 16" straight line datestamp, Type 3A, variety with only two numerals for the year date, exceptionally clear strike applied to folded letter written to England from Tortola on September 14th, consisting largely of a merchant's copy of an August 19th letter and an additional enclosure (not present), all causing this packet letter to be rated "7/-", three times the 1sh/2p packet rate and three times the 1sh/2p inland rate from Falmouth to Kendal, Westmoreland, manuscript receiving endorsement on October 30th, normal file folds, one barely touching the marking, otherwise very fine and an attractive multiple rate letter.

23	1827 "Lancaster/Ship Letter" boxed handstamp on reverse of folded letter datelined "Tortola 20th April 1827", to Kendal in Westmoreland, England, manuscript "1/2", fresh and extremely fine; this illustrates the fastest and most economical way to reach this destination in northern England.

24	"Tortola/5 Aug 34" straight line datestamp, Type 3A, variety with only two numerals in the year date, in black on the reverse of a prepaid folded cover from Tortola, endorsed "(single)" and "p Packet" in manuscript, plus red manuscript "2/2 PP" and red "Paid" tombstone handstamp on front, both establishing prepayment, this is probably a cover for a missionary letter being addressed to a member of the clergy, the docketing also notes "Happy termination of slavery" (slavery was abolished in Tortola on August 1, 1834), occasionally prepaid inbound letters from England are found, but prepaid letters are very rare from Tortola, this is the only example in the McCann collection and there were none in the Fredrick collection.

27	1840 Inbound folded letter to Tortola posted on January 1, 1841 from London, manuscript rate "1/-" for packet service to Tortola and "3 bits" local assessment, marked in manuscript at left "Dead" as explanation for the return of this letter undelivered, also accompanied by the printed folded letter from the Dead-Letter Office in London with "1/5" to be paid by the sender, both letters are very fine; a scarce and very interesting documentation of how such matters were handled, certainly this was not welcome news by the original sender in this case, as the deceased had been sent power of attorney to settle the affairs of an estate on Tortola and the proceeds were being requested.

29	"Tortola/20 Oct 1842" straight line datestamp, Type 3D, quite well struck example applied across the letterjoin on the reverse of a folded packet letter to London, rated "1/-" in manuscript, backstamped, very fine; this is an extremely scarce type of the Tortola datestamp despite the relative late date of usage, being distinguished by the letters being spaced out to give "Tortola" a much longer length (38mm), amazingly elusive as this is the only example in the McCann collection and there was no example in the Fredrick collection.
