\section{1867 4d}

This value, which appeared in 1867 (see references above), was also printed
from a lithographic stone of 25 subjects, and so far as I am aware there was not
more than one transfer employed for the two consignments of 12,000 of i2th July,.
1867, and the 1000 of 6th June, 1868. This, as I have already said, apparently
conflicts with Mr. Haycock's statement that the stone was cleaned after the
requisite number of stamps had been printed. Possibly, however, there was only
one printing, and Messrs. Nissen and Parker or their sub-contractors struck off
a number in excess of their original instructions—in anticipation of further
orders. (Yardley)

The design is the same as that of the essay already displayed, except that the
lamps and the horizontal shading of the large circular medallion and the rainbow
were removed, the latter apparently being replaced by terra firma.

The stamps were all perforated 15 by a single-line machine and exist in shades
of lake and purple-brown on buff, flesh-colour, and pale rose papers. The
impressions on the latter are the scarcest. Besides die proofs in lilac, green, or
vermilion, on card, plate proofs exist in orange-red and rich brown, or blood-red,
on hard white paper and in lake on deep rose papers.

It should be remembered that in the rejected essay as well as in the approved
die and, necessarily, in every stamp, dots will be found in the "u" and "c" of
the value and other letters.

A few permanent minor varieties exist of which the most striking are as
follows :—

4. The outer frame-line is broken at the top over " LA."
ii. The inner frame-line is broken on the right near the top, west of " s."
15. There is a white stroke like an accent to the north-east of the " o " of
" FOUR."
16. There is'a small flaw in the lower left spandrel.

Although there were two consignments, all the stamps so far 
appear to come from one transfer. Complete sheets on the buff or flesh-coloured
papers are well known. I show two in different shades. Mr. Griebert had a
complete sheet on the pale rose paper. It is noteworthy that although there
was a considerable remainder of Nissen and Parker's 4d. stamps, entire sheets of
that value on the buff having been on the market a few years ago, it was
apparently found necessary to overprint 125 sheets of the is. in 1888 with the
value " 4d."
