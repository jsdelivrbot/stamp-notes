\section{1866 Issue}    

The Governor of the Virgin Islands had been authorised in 1863 to make arrangements for the supply of postage stamps, but it was not until 1866 that action was taken, when the London firm of Messrs Nilsen and Parker was instructed to prepare and provide postage stamps for the Islands. The printing of the stamps was contracted to Messrs Waterlow and Sons of London. The stamps were prepared from dies made of steel, and the design was then transferred to stones for printing the stamps by lithography. Four values were printed and there was a succession of printings and deliveries. Brown provides a listing (Brown, 1949) of the printings and which we have adapted in Table~1. 

The stamps were all printed on unwatermarked paper, with the exception of the paper maker's name "A. Cowan and Sons, Extra Superfine". The paper was of good quality, stout and fairly hard varying in colour from white to yellowish, and occassionally blued. The stamps were first studied by Yardley and then by Brown.

\subsection{Colour Trials}

The next step in the production process of the postage stamps is to selct the inks and the colours for the various values and this is done by means of "colour trials".
