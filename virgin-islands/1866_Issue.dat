\section{1866 Issue}    

The Governor of the Virgin Islands had been authorised in 1863 to make arrangements for the supply of postage stamps, but it was not until 1866 that action was taken, when the London firm of Messrs Nilsen and Parker was instructed to prepare and provide postage stamps for the Islands. The printing of the stamps was contracted to Messrs Waterlow and Sons of London. The stamps were prepared from dies made of steel, and the design was then transferred to stones for printing the stamps by lithography. Four values were printed and there was a succession of printings and deliveries. Brown provides a listing (Brown, 1949) of the printings and which we have adapted in Table~1.

From the table it can be observed that in the ten year period between 1866 and 1876 consumption was so low that the 4d., 6d., and 1s. was not printed after 1868.

Yardley writes that a Mr. Rapkin engraved the dies of the four values.  Rapkin appears to have worked for Messrs Waterlow and Sons. Mr Bacon also writing in the RPS states that in fact Messrs Waterlow and Sons produced the Virgin Islands stamps for Messrs Nissen and Parker.


The stamps were all printed on unwatermarked paper, with the exception of the paper maker's name "A. Cowan and Sons, Extra Superfine". The paper was of good quality, stout and fairly hard varying in colour from white to yellowish, and occassionally blued. The stamps were first studied by Yardley and then by Brown. 

\section{Design}
Whatever may have been the true history of the designs—the central parts
of the 1d. and 6d. are almost, if not absolutely, identical—a female figure tripping
in the air to the left with a nimbus or aureole, holding a lamp in her right hand
and a lily in the left, with five lamps on the left and six on the right. In the 1d.
the background is made up of straight horizontal lines while in the 6d. it is of
waved lines.

In the 4d. and is. the Virgin is drawn differently. The figures are not exact
replicas as the shading differs, but they closely resemble one another. The Virgin
stands on ground—has a nimbus of eight stars—with arms folded and hands
crossed on her breast in an attitude of adoration or ecstasy.f In the actual stamps
there are no clouds and no lily. But I show an essayj of the 4d. struck from a die
engraved in taille-douce in which a similar figure stands on clouds and a rainbow
—on a background of lightly engraved horizontal lines with six lamps on each
side. The rest of the design is the same as in the actual 4d. stamps, but this
die was retouched by removing the lamps and background, also the rainbow,
while the clouds were converted into terra firma. Of the identity of the die
there can be no doubt because two little accidental dots which occur in the letters
" u " and " c " of the value in every stamp will be observed in the same letters in
the essay, and in the proofs of the approved die.

The British Museum contains an interesting essay presented to the National
Collection by our President. This, like the issued stamps, was printed from two
plates—the background, which is in rose, closely resembles that of the issued
stamps but it has a coloured border on which is drawn a series of small arches in
white. Over this background is printed in black a figure of the Virgin with
aureole of stars and standing on a rainbow and clouds and with twelve lamps,
six on each side, as in the essay of the 4d. which I show to-night ; but in addition
there are lily plants in bloom, one on each side beyond the lamps ; further, a thin
double-lined rectangular frame encloses the rest of the black design---fitting inside
the rose-coloured border of arches above described. No doubt, as in the case of the
4d. essay, the accessories were considered too elaborate, and the design was
simplified by omitting the black frame, lamps, and lily plants, converting the
clouds and rainbow into firm ground and substituting a thin rose-coloured outline
double-lined frame on white for the heavy border with arches

\subsection{Colour Trials}

The next step in the production process of the postage stamps is to selct the inks and the colours for the various values and this is done by means of "colour trials".
