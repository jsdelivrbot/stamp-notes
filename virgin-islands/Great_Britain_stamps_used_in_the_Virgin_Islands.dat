They are rare and seldom seen the reason being in that in the nineteenth century most of the inhabitants of the Islands were improverished. The Reverend C.S. Martin reported that the official expenditure of the postmaster of Tortola for 1847 amounted 
to 33/- and when British postage stamps were authorised for use in 1858, eight years before regular stamps were issued, the contribution of the Islands to the cost of the Mail Packet Service was only \pound10 annually.

In Figures 1 and 2, we show the two lots from the Wm. Frazer Exhibition Collection. The first one realized three times the high estimate of the auctioneer at full Stanly Gibbons catalogue price. The second one sold higher than the estimate but within a reasonable margin over the estimate. Another barred oval cancellation which is associated with the British Virgin Islands is the "A 91". Early authors casted doubt on it having really been used in the Islands and perhaps this reflected on the price for the lot below.
