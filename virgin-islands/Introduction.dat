\section{Virgin Islands}
The British colony of the British Virgin Islands has produced its own stamps since 1866. Before that it used un-overprinted British stamps which may be identified by the cancel A13 for the main city Tortola.[1]


First stamps

The \ilink[first issue]{/virgin-islands/1866_Issue} were produced in 1866 and included a depiction of St. Ursula[2] who, according to legend, had 11,000 virginal handmaidens, and after whom the islands had been named.

Leeward Islands stamps

Main article: Postage stamps and postal history of the Leeward Islands
In 1890 stamps for the islands were replaced with the general issue for the Leeward Islands until 1903 when separate issues for the Virgin Islands were resumed. Between 1903 and 1956 Virgin Islands and Leeward Islands stamps were used concurrently.[1]
[edit]Change of name

Since 1968 the stamps have been inscribed British Virgin Islands rather than just Virgin Islands as they had been before. This was to avoid confusion with the American Virgin Islands which are administratively separate and use United States stamps.[1]
