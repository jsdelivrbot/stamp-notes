\chapter{1899 Virgin of the Lilies Issue}

A notice in the \textit{Philatelic Record} of March? 1899 stated:

\begin{quotation}
Contrary to our expectations, which were based on semi-official information, a new set of stamps has appeared here, so that the Islands have
apparently seceded from the Leeward Islands
federation. A figure of the Virgin is still the
central design, but the stamps are not nearly
as pretty or artistic as the former issues. They are watermarked Crown CC. and
perf. 14. 

Adhesives.

\begin{verbatim}
1/2 d. yellow green.
1d. brick red.
2 1/2d. blue.
4d. brown.
6d. purple.
7d. deep green.
1s. yellow brown.
5s. indigo.
\end{verbatim}

\end{quotation}

Early in 1899 a fresh issue of stamps was produced with an entirely different design. They were engraved in \textit{taille douce}, by Messrs. De La Rue and Co., there being eight different values, form 1/2d to 5/-, printed in various colours, but all of uniform design.

The stamps were in sheets or panes of 60 subject, arranged in ten horizontal rows of six, and were printed on Crown CA paper, and perforated 14.

There were no flaws as in the previous lithographic issues, but rather unusually, the plates showed certain defects which have attained catalogue rank, as varieties, although they are mechanical flaws in reproduction from the dies.

There are two errors in the 1/2d. value, one on the first stamp in the tenth row, and the other on the second stamp in the eighth row, in the sheet of 60 stamps, and the error in the 4d. value, the last letter of the word "PENCE" reading "F" instead of "E", is the third stamp in the bottom row. The error on the 4d. value is much scarcer than that on the 1/2d. values. It was probably quickly discovered and removed from the sheets.
