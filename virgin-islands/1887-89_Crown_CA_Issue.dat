\chapter{1887-89 Crown CA Issue}    

The last value supplied by Messrs. De La Rue and Co., the 1s is recorded in the 
Philatelic Record of March 1889. Although it is obvious it was based on the same design as the Nissen-Parker dies of this value, a new die embracing the whole of the design was presumably constructed as the new stamps were printed in one colour. Further the Nissen-Parker die was retouched as the glory is much larger in the De La Rue stamps than in the earlier stamps.
