\chapter{1929-30 Puffins Issue}   


On encountering the stamps as a young boy, I had visions that in order to buy them one had to catch a puffin or two! Mr. Harman chose the puffin as his unit of currency, because more than a century since the stamps were issued there was a brisk trade in the feathers of seabirds, particularly puffins, with the mainland. Gade\cite{Gade} tells the story in more detail: Twelve birds would make produce 1 lb. of feathers, and a system of barter grew up, so that for so many puffins were regarded as the price of 1 lb of sugar, or some other commodity which could not be produced on the island. Literally tens of thousands {{wi:puffins}}, {{wi: guillemots}}, {{wi: razorbills}} and {{wi:kittiwake}} gulls annually visited Lundy to nest, and the killing of so many birds for their feathers seemed to make little or no impression on their numbers.
