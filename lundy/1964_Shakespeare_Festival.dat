According to Mr. Gade, the 400th anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare "induced Mr Harman to agree to a commemorative stamp issue". The stamps were issued on July 29th 1964. The design portrays a bust of Shakespeare and a stooping peregrine falcon, with the quotation: "A falcon towering in her pride of place", and below "William Shakespeare 1564-1964."
