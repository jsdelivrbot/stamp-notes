\chapter{Introduction}

With a current population of 28 one has to be very careful to consider collecting 
the stamps of Lundy as they were obviously produced and marketed for the philatelic
market.
In 1955 The Standing Joint Committee of the British Philatelic Association and the Philatelic Trader's
Society issued an announcement regading the issues of Lundy and Herm Local stamps \cite{LP0747}
in which it wass pointed that there was no law against the use of these labels so long as they were
not passed off as Government issued postage stamps. The statement was very strong regarding their
origin and issue:-

\begin{quotation}
  The recent Herm Island lot in beautiful colours is the complete prostitution of the title
  "Local Stamp."  Devised and produced by a speculative stamp dealer, they are sold for
  a fraction of "face" to dealers willing to market them, here and in the United States, and
  elsewhere. For example, on the day the set was issued (face 4/6\half) they were on sale in
  Paris at 125fr. (2/6).
\end{quotation}

The Committee also pointed out that: "genuine early private 'Locals' had an honoured place
in the album together with the Post Office issues of the particular country," but it strongly
advised discriminating collectors to eschew--"the elaborate series of money-making labels
of Lundy and Herm which have been and are being issued. The B.P.A./P.T.S. Standing Joint
Committee appeals to the common sense of collectors and dealers not to be misled or indeed
to mislead."

Lundy is the largest island in the Bristol Channel, lying 12 miles (19 km) off the coast of Devon, 
England, approximately one third of the distance across the channel between England and Wales. 
Lundy gives its name to a British sea area and is one of the islands of England.[3]

As of 2007, there was a resident population of 28 people, including volunteers. These include a 
warden, ranger, island manager, and farmer, as well as bar and house-keeping staff. Most live in 
and around the village at the south of the island. Most visitors are day-trippers, although there 
are 23 holiday properties and a camp site for staying visitors, mostly also around the south of 
the island.

In a 2005 opinion poll of Radio Times readers, Lundy was named as Britain's tenth greatest 
natural wonder. The entire island has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific 
Interest[4] and it was England's first statutory Marine Nature Reserve, and the first 
Marine Conservation Zone,[5] because of its unique flora and fauna.[6] It is managed 
by the Landmark Trust on behalf of the National Trust.

Owing to a decline in population and lack of interest in the mail contract, the GPO ended 
its presence on Lundy at the end of 1927.[78] For the next couple of years Harman handled 
the mail to and from the island without charge. On 1 November 1929, he decided to offset 
the expense by issuing two postage stamps (1/2 puffin in pink and 1 puffin in blue). One 
puffin is equivalent to one English penny. The printing of Puffin stamps continues to this 
day and are available at face value from the Lundy Post Office, located inside the 
Lundy shop at the south end of the island. Historically there was a requirement that 
Lundy stamps be placed on the reverse of the envelope; however, Royal Mail now allows 
their use on the front of the envelope, but placed on the left side, with the right side 
reserved for the Royal Mail postage stamp or stamps. Lundy stamps are cancelled by a 
circular Lundy handstamp. The face value of the Lundy Island stamps covers the cost of 
postage of letters and postcards from the island to the Bideford Post Office on the 
mainland and for onward delivery to their final destination anywhere in the world. 
A meter cancel is applied in Bideford. The Lundy Post Office gets a bulk rate discount 
for mailing letters and postcards from Bideford. Lundy Island stamps (sometimes called Puffins) 
are a type of postage stamp known to philatelists as "local carriage labels" or "local stamps". 
Issues of increasing value were made over the years, including air mail, featuring a variety 
of people. Many are now highly sought-after by collectors.[79] with the value of the early 
issues rising substantially over the years. For the many thousands of annual visitors 
Lundy stamps have become part of the collection of the many British Local Posts 
collectors. The first catalogues of these stamps included Gerald Rosen's 1970 Catalogue 
of British Local Stamps. Later specialist catalogues include Stamps of Lundy Island by 
Stanley Newman, first published in 1984, Phillips Modern British Locals CD Catalogue, 
published since 2003, and Labbe's Specialized Guide to Lundy Island Stamps. There is a 
comprehensive collection of these stamps in the Chinchen Collection, donated by Barry Chinchen[80] 
to the British Library Philatelic Collections in 1977 and located at the British Library. 
This is also the home of the Landmark Trust Lundy Island Philatelic Archive which includes 
artwork, texts and essays as well as postmarking devices and issued stamps.[81]
