\ph[85%]{../lundy/549.jpg}{Lot: 1433		Sale: 15 1649 Civil War naval letter from William Robinson 'from aboard the Triumph neare the Isle of Lundee, June 6th 1649' to his wife in Westminster. In 'England's Postal History' R.M. Willcocks refers to this correspondence and this letter in particular on page 12 - 'Two days later he follows this [referring to an earlier letter] with another which is one of the most important, and certainly the greatest enigma, 'I sent thee a pacquett of letters yesterday dated from Milford Haven, but this going by the Post I hope may come as soone to thee as that: if it doe, prithee send away those enclosed with speed' but this is written 'from aboard the Triumph neare the Isle of Lundee, June 6th 1649'. Later he says 'A lettr now would be dearely wellcome to mee from thee, for meethinkes it is an age since I receiv'd one'. The remainder is a charming example of a love letter showing the pious trust in God of the puritans, and emphasizes Robinson's position of friendship with Col. Fleetwood (who became Commander-in-Chief of the Parliamentary forces and married Cromwell's daughter) and Mr Speaker, and that his cousin Luke Robinson was a member of the Council of State. He speaks as if this letter was a 'first day cover' of the new post, which he expected would arrive before his letter of 4th June, yet he wrote it when out at sea. If the post ran from Milford, had they a supply ship just going in there ? The address leaf has no charge, endorsement, or other clue.' The address leaf is soiled and crumpled but a most important and historic item, probably a first day cover in a very restricted post, the first since 1642 (not until 1653 was there a normal post), and certainly the earliest known letter from Lundy Island.

Photo.This letter was the subject of an article in 'Postal History' no. 321 by Tony Wiseman, in which he concludes 

'There can be no doubt that the 6th June 1649 letter signed by William Robinson is the earliest certifiable letter of the New Post set up by the Commonwealth in the aftermath of the First Civil War.The Triumph (1623–1687) was a 70 gun 2nd rate battleship later present at many battles with the Dutch. In 1649 she was part of the main Commonwealth Fleet despatched to the Irish Sea to assist Cromwell move his Army about Ireland. The Fleet not only supplied victuals but also carried his siege train to Wexford to assist at its siege. Sea General Robert Blake started his blockade of Prince Rupert in Kinsale from May 21st. He raised his flag in the Triumph and he will now be called ''Admiral''. Price Realised £200.}
