\chapter{1941 'V' and 'Plane' Overprints}    

During the War years several overprints of the existing Lumdy stamps were made to commemorate special events. The overprinting being nessecary as the materials for special sets of stamps were not available. 

On the 1 November 1939 was the tenth anniversary of the first issue of the Lundy stamps, and Mr Harman felt it was a fitting occassion for some commemoration. 5400 of each of the existing Lundy stamps were overprinted with the dates 1929/1939 in red. In April 1940 it was suggested that quantities of the eight Lundy stamps should be overprinted with the Geneva Cross, and in the middle of the stamps, red cross surtax. the proceeds were donated to the Brirish Red Cross Society. This therefore became the first charity issue of LUndy stamps.
