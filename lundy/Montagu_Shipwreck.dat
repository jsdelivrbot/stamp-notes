A naval footnote in the history of Lundy was the wreck of the Royal Navy 
battleship HMS Montagu. Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard aground 
near Shutter Rock on the island's southwest corner at about 2:00 a.m. 
on 30 May 1906.[38] Thinking they were aground at Hartland Point on 
the English mainland, a landing party went ashore for help, only finding 
out where they were after encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island's north light.

HMS Montagu during the failed salvage attempts of the summer of 1906

Strenuous efforts by the Royal Navy to salvage the badly damaged battleship during the summer of 1906 failed, and in 1907 it was decided to give up and sell her for scrap. Montagu was scrapped at the scene over the next fifteen years. Diving clubs still visit the site, where armour plate and live 12-inch (305-millimetre) shells remain on the seabed.
