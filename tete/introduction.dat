\section{Tete}

Tete is a province of Mozambique. It has an area of 100,724 km2 and a population of approximately 1.551.949 (2006).[1]
Tete is the capital of the province. The Cahora Bassa Dam is situated in this province.

In 1913 and 1914, Portugal issued postage stamps specifically for the province. The 1913 stamps were those of the Vasco da Gama issue of 1898, overprinted "REPUBLICA / TETE" and a new denomination in centavos.

Each of the eight values from Macau, Portuguese Africa, and Timor were overprinted, yielding a total of 24 stamps.

In 1914, the omnibus Ceres issue of Portugal included 16 values for Tete, ranging from 1/4 centavo to one escudo. Subsequently Tete reverted to using the stamps of Mozambique.

Although these stamps are not rare, none costing the collector over about US$10, genuinely-used examples are harder to find, and command a premium of about 50-100% over unused.
