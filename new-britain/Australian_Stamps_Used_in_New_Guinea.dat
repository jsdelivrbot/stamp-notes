At the end of October Australian stamps 
with the kangaroo symbol were also put into service. See Fig. 11 for an example of these stamps. ...

Following the withdrawal of the military police, an Australian military post office was opened in the postal building. The administration was turned over to Sergeant Moore, who was [later] named Chief Postmaster. The Australian mail arrived in Rabaul without any franking. There were no cancels, official seals, books, packing material, mail sacks or postage stamps available, since it was believed that the postal establishment of German New Guinea would be found in complete order.

Fieldpost letters sent by the soldiers were not exempt from charges. 
As a result of the lack of stamps, however, these letters were at first 
sent unfranked when marked no stamps available.

According to newspaper reports, a storm of indignation arose in Sydney, since the so-designated letters were delivered there only after payment of the high international mail charge. See Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 for examples of such "On Active Service" mail, treated as I d postage due in Australia. The lack of postmarks was noticed with displeasure. Rubber stamp cancels from Rabaul were used at times; one was a totally different cancel with the designation Simpsonhafen and even an old canceler from Stephansort without day and date, but with the fixed year 13 was used. In 1915 a rubber oval postmark with the designation 
Rabaul (New-Britain) was introduced from Sydney. See Fig. 7, Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 for examples of these cancels.

NEW GUINEA - Australian Stamps Used in New Guinea
	
1914 (late) blue cover to Sydney with �d & 2d - correctly paying the civilian rate - 
tied by two superb strikes of the straight-line 'Herbertsh�he' handstamp (Powell #11) in violet, 
'Engelhardt & Co/Kokosplantage KABAKON/...' (= coconut plantation) 
imprint at upper-left, attractively endorsed "Censored/StuartWCameron/ Lieut RANR" 
in red at left, readdressed on arrival to a GPO Box, horizontal & vertical folds and 
some minor blemishes. An eye-catching cover. 

Ex "Bismarck": sold for $2352.

Kabakon is in the Neu Lauenberg ({{wi:Duke_of_York_Islands}} in the channel 
between New Britain & New Ireland (Solomons). 

In 1902, one August Engelhardt moved from Germany with some 30 followers and established a nudist colony on Kabakon. Strict vegetarians, their staple dietary item was the venerable coconut. They also operated a coconut plantation, presumably specialising in the raw product (pun intended). Engelhardt was interned early in 1915 but his nudist tendencies probably hastened his release back to Kabakon, where he died in May 1919. [See also Lot 101]
