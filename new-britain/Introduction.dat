"New Britain" was the title conferred by the Australian Commonwealth authorities upon the former German territories
on the mainland of New Guinea and the adjacent islands of the Bismark Archipelago, which were occupied
on September 11th, 1914, by a combined naval and military expedition and after, some severe fighting transferred to the temporary 
administration of the Australian Government. The name is that of one of the chief islands of the Bismarck group, on which stands 
Herbertshole, the former capital settlement.

At Herbertshole, the entire stock of postage stamps appears to have been destroyed by the German Colonial officials on the advent of the British expedition, and it was
not until the seizure of Rabaul, the new administrative headquarters of German New Guinea across the bay, that a small supply
was accidentally discovered hidden away amongst the personal effects of the ex-German postmaster.

These were promptly commandeered by the provisional government to serve as a temporary isuue for the use
of members of the naval military forces. They were of the ususal German Colonial type of 1900 incribed "Deutch
Neu Guinea".

On October 15th the following announcement was published in the local gazette:-

<blockquote>
The postage stamps of the late German administration seized at the Post office, rabaul, after British military occupation, have been endorsed with the Royal 
initials "G.R.I.", and their respective value altered as found necessary. In future all letters
posted from the garrisons of Rabaul and Herbertshole will require, before being accepted
for tranmission by mail, to have affixed to same the necessary stamps, which may be obtained
on application to the postmaster at each of these places.

</blockquote>

For the purpose of overprinting these stamps a temporary printing office was set up in the Mission
school-room, where a small handpress was installed. As in Samoa, the local shortage of type was overcome by setting
up a single (this time horizontal) row of ten overprints so that each complete sheet of 100
stamps had to be inserted ten times in the press before it was completely
overprinted. The value surcharge was altered so soon as the available supply of each denomination had been
impressed with the overprint, the space between the Royal cypher and the figures of value measuring
in the first printing 6 mm. The letters "G.R.I", however, remained unchanged.

These provisional occupation stamps of the australian administration were first placed on sale on October 17th, 1914, and so great was the demand for them as souvenirs by members of the 
expeditionary force, that it was soon found necessary to restrict
the sale to not more than 10s. worth of any value per man.

A further find of old german New Guinea postage stamps
at {{wi: Kawieng}} later in the year enabled a second printing
of the "G.R.I." series to be made, distinguished
by the fact that the letters and figures are now only 5 mm. apart. It is in the second
printing that most of the well known varieties of New Britain occur.

Othe rprintings are believed to have  been made from time to time to a total face value
of £505. The following are the approximate quantities of each value comprising of all printings on
authority of the first Postmaster of New britain, Sergt. G.W.Moore, under whose control
the initial issue took place:--


Of the highest two values, it seems doubtful if any copies were actually on sale to the public,
but they were included in complimentary sets presented to H.M. the King, various high officials of the Australian
Government, Museums, etc.

There are a number of prominent errors and varieties of the overpint, as well as innumerable
minor varieties, some of which are interesting in so far as they help to determine the arrangements of the different settings.

##Marshall Islands Series

A contingent of the Australian expeditionary Force dispatched to take over, on behalf of the
Commonwealth Government, the island of nauru in the Marshall Group (which has been seized by a Japanese naval detachment),
at the request of the Imperial authorities, brought with them
on the return journey to rabaul, the stock of ex-German
Colonial postage stamps, inscribed "Marshall Inseln", found
in the post office there, of a total face value amounting to about
£290. These were adapted for
use under the new regime by overprinting them from the 
second setting of the "G.R.I." and value, and since the
necessity for postage stamps in the island of their origin was small, were used
in New Britain itself concurrently with those of German New Guinea.

In the 1d. on 3 pfg. and 5 pfg. stamps, two very distinct
types of numerals were employed, the first (a) with a slanting serif to the figure '1', and the
second (b) with a flat-topped "1".



In explanation of the existence of certain Marshall island stamps
overprinted from the first setting, it is stated that a large number
of odd stamps were found in New Britain, amongst them being a few values of the Marshall islands
series. these were mounted on sheets of paper in strips of ten
before overprinting, no account being taken of the inscriptions,
Marshall and New Guinea stamps being included in the same strip.
