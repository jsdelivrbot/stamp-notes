Part of the samll find of 3, 5, 10, and 20pfg. stamps of
the German Administration, unearthed in febrauary or March, 1915, was reserved for official use,
the two lowest values receiving the usual overprint
reading "G.R.I.--1d.", with the addition of the letters
"O.S." at the top signifying "On Service"), for use on departmental
correspondence. To admit to the inclusion  of the extra line
the type was closed up, reducing the space between the
initials "G.R.I." and the value to 3 1/2 mm.
