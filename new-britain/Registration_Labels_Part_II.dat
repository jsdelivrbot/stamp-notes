Name of the Town in Serif Letters: 'Kawieng/(Deutsch Neuguinea)' SG 42 vertical pair with Two Additional Diagonal Impressions of the Town Name, a few short perfs at the base, large-part o.g., Cat £340++. Ex Leven (and not part of the "Ello" Collection). RPSofL Certificate (1983) absurdly states "with part offset on the face": if it was an "offset" it would be in reverse on the reverse. [Gibbs at p94 states "...vague misaligned doubling of the town name...are most often seen on the various labels of Kawieng"]
