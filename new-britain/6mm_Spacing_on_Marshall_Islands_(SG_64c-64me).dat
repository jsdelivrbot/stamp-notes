'G.R.I.' OVERPRINTS
	

'1d.' on 3pf brown as SG 64c but [Stg 1B] 'G.R.1.' (Defective 'I'), Cat £2000+. A highly important stamp, which is believed to be the only example of [Stg 1B] on any surcharged Marshall Island stamp. Holcombe Opinion (1990) states "Setting 1B has only been recorded to date on New Guinea stamps...this is the only copy [on Marshall Islands] found to date". [Tim Rybak had no example of SG 64c. His mint example of the 6mm '1d.' on 5pf SG 64d - also Cat £2000 - sold for $3910]ÞÞGibbs at pages 40-41 states "[Positions 1A 1B & 1C] appear to be related and probably form part of a rare intermediate setting...somewhere between the first and the fifth settings. The spacing is 6mm. These overprints are found only on stamps of DNG...Position 1B...'I' has no serif at upper-right, resembling the letter in [Stg 5 Pos 9]..."

6mm Spacing on Marshall Islands (SG 64c-64me)
	
'3d.' on 30pf black & orange/buff as SG 64j but 5½mm Spacing [Stg 6 Pos 3], well centred, unmounted. Superb! Holcombe Certificate (1998) states "The 5½mm spacing exists on both DNG & Marshalls stamps but are very rare, probably rarer than the [irregular] 6mm spacings. I have recorded less than 10 stamps [of either] SG 55 or 64j, one of which [- this stamp -] also has the Broken 'R' peculiar to this setting." ÞÞThis is obviously quite an enigma. Gibbs doesn't list this particular variety in either the First or Second Issue and Holcombe hedges his bets as to the issue to which it belongs (but he is unequivocal that it is "in my opinion genuine"). Our vendor considers that it belongs to the Second Issue SG 64j (Cat £3750). Clearly, it is a rare stamp. However, prospective bidders must make a personal assessment of its status, and we have adopted what we believe is a necessarily conservative estimate.

In explanation of the existence of certain Marshall island stamps
overprinted from the first setting, it is stated that a large number
of odd stamps were found in New Britain, amongst them being a few values of the Marshall islands
series. these were mounted on sheets of paper in strips of ten
before overprinting, no account being taken of the inscriptions,
Marshall and New Guinea stamps being included in the same strip.

Lot 158, Prestige "Ello" Collection March 2009
	
'G.R.I.' OVERPRINTS
	
6mm Spacing on Marshall Islands (SG 64c-64me)
	
'1d.' on 5pf green SG 64d [Stg 1 Pos 2] being the second unit on the second row each of 10 single stamps - of which all the others are German New Guinea 6mm Setting SG 2 - all "tacked" (and subsequently affixed) to a piece of paper "blanket" for the purpose of overprinting, the last position having been left blank causing 'G.R.I./1d.' to be printed on the blanket, a few very minor blemishes not affecting the critical stamp and in no way detracting from the importance and appeal of this amazing item, Cat £60 x18 = £1080 + £2000. Ex Bute (Lot 252). RPSofL Certificate (1962).ÞÞFrom a technical perspective, this is one of the most important pieces of the entire GRI Series. 1) It comprises two full rows of the setting; 2) it demonstrates the method of tacking individual stamps to a paper backing to allow them to be overprinted; 3) it proves that any stamps to hand were utilised in this manner; 4) and it strongly hints at the manner in which many of the inverted overprints were produced, as a result of single stamps being accidentally tacked upside-down onto the blanket. ÞÞFor an explanation of the printing process, see Gibbs at pages 5-6. For similar instances of se-tenant German New Guinea & Marshall Islands stamps see Lot 160 and Gibbs at page 128.

'3d.' on 30pf black & orange/buff SG 64j [Stg 7 Pos 3] being the central unit of 3 single stamps - the others being DNG 6mm Setting SG 8 - all "tacked" (and subsequently affixed) to a small piece of paper "blanket" for the purpose of overprinting, Cat £300 x2 = £600 + £3750. Another technically important item. Ex Bute (Lot 254). ÞÞHolcombe Certificate (1990) states "Only very few pieces are known where New Guinea & Marshall Islands [stamps] are mixed together [sic] when being overprinted...A rarity & possibly unique". [Tim Rybak's mint single of SG 64j sold for $8050]
