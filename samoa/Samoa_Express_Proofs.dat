### Samoa Express Cover

In 1870, G. L. Griffiths, an enterprising pioneer printer and publisher of The Fiji Times, saw the need for a postal service in the local islands and to overseas countries. At this time, Fiji was a most important trading center of the South Seas. Griffiths opened his 'non-government' post office, "The Fiji Times Express", on October 15, 1870. The project was financially quite successful.


The success of Griffiths' enterprise appears to have influenced him to spread his wings. He selected Samoa as his next conquest, but failed to appreciate the differences in the situations of the two island groups. Fiji had about 80 inhabited islands where there were about 2,000 European traders and missionaries. Samoa on the other hand in 1877 had only 130 Europeans, the majority of whom lived in Apia. As Griffiths was the publisher of the newspaper Samoa Times, the formation of his second "non-government" post office was also a means of expediting delivery of his own publication.


The Samoa Times Express stamps are legendary. During the period from 1877 to 1881 there were seven different values issued  1d, 3d, 6d, 9d, 1s, 2s, and 5s. These stamps have been reprinted and forged. The Samoan Express postal venture closed during September 1881.

The most comprehensive census of the Samoa Express covers is in Robert Odenweller's book The Stamps and Postal History of Nineteenth Century Samoa. He records a total of eleven covers, including five with the 1sh. Destinations include three to Germany and one to Italy. The rate was one shilling per half-ounce. One other bears this same combination of stamps, which is illustrated on the front cover of the Odenweller book.
