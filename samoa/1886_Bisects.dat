### 1886 Bisects
On the first day of  April 1895 a fire in the Apia Post Office destroyed all stocks of stamps except these perf 12 1/2, 1/- pink. The Post Office bisected them to use for the much used 2\halfd rate for overseas letters, between April and May. All genuine cancels were in this blue ink, as the fire destroyed the black cancel pad. SG 25a, Cat \pound 325 on cover. 

\ph[99%]{../samoa/2288.jpg}{Samoa, 1886, 1sh Rose Carmine, Perf 12 1/2, Bisected Diagonally. Lower left half tied by neat blue "Apia, Samoa, Apr 18, 96" cds on registered merchant parcel front to Chemsford, England, manuscript "Per R.M.S. Mariposa" endorsement and mostly complete purple "London, 24 My, 95" registry date stamp; minor perf toning, otherwise Very Fine, this being the first and only Provisional 1sh bisect usage recorded on April 18, 1895 in the first mail sent after the fire of April 1 which destroyed the Apia Post Office and is likely to be the only commercial usage of the Provisional 1sh bisect known (Odenweller 496).

Later on, the newly arrived perf 11 1/- stocks were bisected (mostly vertically not diagonally) and sold to collectors. All those cancels were in black - as a new black stamp pad arrived - along with the perf 11s.

Comparing the two covers shown above, one can easily see that the second one lacks any character or taste and hence the huge gap in price between them. When buying postal history items, seek to get genuine postally used covers.
