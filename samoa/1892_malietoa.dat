### 1892 Malietoa

Clippings.
Samoa Islands. In the event of his most gracious majesty Malietoa,
king of the Samoa Islands, bestowing postal facilities on his people,
we may know what to expect in the way of stamps from the following
description of his seal : " It is about twice the circumference of a
twenty-dollar gold-piece, bordered with a crown on top, surmounted by
cross, by the side of which two cocoanut trees shake their stately
branches. Below the crown is something in the shape of a Freemason's
apron, with a star representing the islands, and a Bible open beneath the
star. In a serpentine form below these are the words, lau afioga o lou
Malamalama lea (0 Lord, thy word is my light). Finally, within the
border, beneath all, is inscribed, " Malietoa I." The national seal is
the size of the King's seal. Within the upper double border are the
native words, Paimua ma le malo o Samoa (the Parliament and
people of Samoa(. A crown is beneath, surmounted by a cross, which
is just above a sort of parallelogram containing a bird hatching its
young, a cross, an anchor, and a palm tree. On the sides of the parallelogram are two natives, one robed in his nakedness, except the lavalava, signifying the past, and the other dressed in American costume,
as if delivering a stump speech, signifying the future. Below these,
in serpentine form, is the Latin quotation, Omnia ad Dei gloria (all
praise to God). The figures 1873, with stars on either side, finish the
work. The seals are imposing in appearance, and are reputed to have
tickled immensely the native fancy."
