In 1899 the colour of the Palm Tree Â£d. stamp was changed from purple to green and that
of the Id. value from green to red-brown, paper and perforation remaining the same. The
regulations of the U.P.U. may have been the reason for this change.
It was in that year that civil war between rival chieftains was finally brought to an end
by abolition of the Samoan monarchy and the setting up of a Provisional Government, with
powers vested in the Consuls of Great Britain, the United States and Germany.33
Eight of the contemporary stamps (\half d. to 2s. 6d.) were overprinted 'PROVISIONAL
GOVT.' and, although in philatelic circles the issue was dubbed speculative, it was subsequently stated by John Davis that these provisional were authorised by the Chief Justice in Apia.34

This comment appeared at the time:

'There seems good reason to hope that with the final settlement of the political position
of these islands a stop may be put to the production of provisional stamps, varieties of
surcharge, etc., and a real Government Post Office established, in the place of the private
business which has no doubt been very profitable to the "concessionaire" who has run
it so long.

The stamps surcharged "Provisional Govt." are, we gather from The Australian Ph.,
purely speculative, as the Government has nothing to do with the business.'

A shortage of two values was met by overprinting from stereos on the 2d. (P. 11) a
'Surcharged l \half d.' in bright ultramarine and a freshly-designed 'R.3d.' surcharged in green. A 'R.3d.' surcharged in black has been recorded and as the orange-red shade of the 2d. value is only known in a surcharged state, its genuineness seems undoubted but it could be an essay or proof.35

Several different types of postmarks were used during the Palm Tree issue period.

As the century came to a close, new international treaties were concluded, whereby
Great Britain, in exchange for concessions elsewhere, renounced all its rights in Samoa.
Western Samoa became a German Protectorate36 and the United States assumed sovereignty
over Eastern Samoa.

The postal service, which John Davis had operated for fifteen years, closed for good on
28th February, 1900."
