## Samoa Express (1877-81)

The Samoa express stamps were printed in blocks of five by five. Large surviving blocks are rare and plating is mostly done via small positional differences.

Plating of the Samoa Express issues was first carried out half a century ago by that knowledgeable and competent philatelist - Robert Blake Yardley, a Past President of the
Royal Philatelic Society.7

Fortunately for the Society it counts amongst its present members H. G. Leslie Fletcher
who, as is well known, has made a life study of 'locals' (for such are the Samoa Express
stamps) as well as forgeries. For some years past he has been working on the plating of the
four different states of the genuine Samoa Express stamps and on all values of the reprints,
so that the status and position of any stamp can easily be ascertained.

In that task he has been greatly assisted by the excellent monograph of Jack R. Hughes,
Oakland, California, with whom he is in close touch.8 Until now each has been working
individually but apparently their conclusions coincide closely. H. G. Leslie Fletcher says
that some discrepancies still have to be straightened out but he hopes soon to be able to
suggest additions and corrections to the monograph of Jack R. Hughes. The outcome of
their research will be keenly awaited.

Meanwhile, through the kind co-operation of H. G. Leslie Fletcher, Jack R. Hughes,9
J. H. Powell of East Roseville, N.S.W. and A. R. Burge of Wellington, N.Z., details are
given in Appendix A of twelve Samoa Express combination covers that have been traced.
Of these twelve covers, thanks to the owners and by examining auction catalogues, photographs
of nine of them are on display, so that the various combinations of stamps used as
well as the postal markings may be studied.

Between 1881 and 1886 Samoa had no public postal facilities.10 Some of the consuls,
however, acted as postmasters by providing their own nationals with appropriate facilities.11

Envelopes posted in Samoa in 1884 with New Zealand stamps on them are mentioned
in the philatelic literature.12

After 1892, however, the New Zealand Authorities sent out a circular inviting members
of the Postal Union to accept letters from Samoa by way of Auckland or San Francisco
and found in the New Zealand mails for other countries, without charging extra postage on
delivery. They were, in fact, to be treated in all respects as if originating in New Zealand and franked with the stamps of that island.13

Evidence certainly exists of the postal facilities provided in those early days by the consuls
of Germany and the United States for homeward-bound mail despatched by their own
nationals and detailed particulars will be found in Sections IV and V.
But there is singular silence about letters sent home by British subjects in Samoa, on
British boats, franked with British postage stamps. Some such letters may even have
Samoan cancellations but in other cases the British stamps would have been affixed by the
ship's officer on arrival at a British port.
Seeing that Great Britain was the first country in Samoa to appoint a consul, letters sent
from there in the early eighteen-eighties, bearing the stamps of Great Britain, may well exist
and any contemporary data found by collectors of G.B. stamps used abroad will be welcome.
