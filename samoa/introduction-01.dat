The type finally adopted had, through a shortage of characters
to be set up to overprint a single row of ten stamps only at one impression, with the result
that the work had to be carried out by a laborious and lengthy process of running every complete sheet of 100 stamps
ten times through the press. Nevertheless, the overprinted stamps
were ready for issue to the public on September 3rd, 1914, the 
total quantity surcharged amounting to about &pound 830 face value. Only intact sheets were
printed, all single and odd stamps being officially destroyed.

__In all, there were two printings of the pence values and three of the shilling
denominations of the Samoan occupation issue stamps.__

###Errors and Varieties
The poor production method resulted in a great number of varieties, both major and minor. The most notable being
the __Shillings__ for __Shilling__ on 1 mark, found on all stamps of the first printing, but subsequently corrected.
Thus it happened than the stamp with the normal overprint is scarcer than the error! Evidently the same setting of type had been
employed for the 2s, 3s and 5s., with
merely the alteration of the numeral, and the discrepancy was not at first observed.

A number of double and inverted overprints exist and they are all rare albeit their value does not sometimes refelect their scarcity.
Genuinely used covers are very few and are difficult to find. They occassionally appear in Stamp Auctions.

__A number of varieties were produced, and this is a rich collecting area.__
