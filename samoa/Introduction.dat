\section{Historical}

THE Samoan group of islands, sentimentally called 'the pearls of the South Pacific', lie
some 130 miles north of Tonga and between 400 and 500 miles north-east of Fiji.
In Western Samoa, there are two main islands, namely Upolu and Savai'i, together with
seven smaller ones. Apia, on Upolu, is the chief town and only port for overseas shipping.
The largest island in American (or Eastern) Samoa1 is Tutuila, with its administrative
centre and fine harbour at Pago Pago.

There are about 100,000 Samoans and some 6,000 persons of European status in Western
Samoa. Eastern Samoa (20,000) consists almost wholly of Samoans.

The indigenous inhabitants are Polynesians whom Robert Louis Stevenson called
"God's best, at least God's sweetest work."2

The first European to sight Samoa was Jacob Roggeveen, a Dutchman who, after battling
his way round Cape Horn, was heading for Java (1722). Forty-six years later Samoa was
visited by Bougainville, the famous French explorer, who entered it on his chart as the
'ile des Navigateurs', because of the countless native canoes.3

\section{Missionaries' Letters}

The London Missionary Society's vessel, the Duff, was the first Christian Missionary ship
to sail the Pacific (1797) but she never called at Samoa.

It was not until 18304 that two of the Society's Missionaries, John Williams and Charles
Barff of Tahiti, first visited the group, landing at Sapapalii in Savai'i and returning two years later. Other London Missionary Society Missionaries, fresh from England, settled in Samoa in 1836. Having been privileged to peruse the extensive archives of that Society,
to whom I would like to express my cordial thanks, the postal history is as follows.

The earliest letter concerning Samoa is a copy of one dated 11th January, 1836 from the
Rev. George Platt to the Rev. Thomas, Superintendent of the Wesleyan South Seas Mission,
saying that he "would rejoice in the entire evangelisation of the Samoas and all Polynesia".

Then follow two letters, both originals, from the Rev. George Platt despatched from
Sapapalii in Savai'i. The one is dated 15th February, 1836 and reached London on 2nd
November, 1836. The other, dated 19th May, 1836, arrived in London on 17th June, 1837.
Presumably both letters were brought by hand, as neither has any 'Ship Letter' or other
marking.

Next come two letters from Apia, both bearing 'SHIPLETTER GRAVESEND' within
a rectangle.

From these photostats of them, kindly made available through the courtesy of the Society,
it will be seen that the first was written on 13th June, 1836 and has a London c.d.s. of
15th June, 1837. The second letter left on 14th June 1836 and has a London c.d.s. of 13th
June, 1837.

From that time onwards, the Society has a continuous sequence of correspondence from
Samoa right down to the present day and, apart from their absorbing interest to the postal
historian, the letters portray a vivid panorama of life in the islands of the Southern Seas.5

Some years ago the Society sanctioned the sale from its archives of a small number of
letters that lacked historic importance.6 These are naturally prized by collectors, and some specimens, starting in 1836, are here for you to study. (Fig. 1).


#New Zealand Occupation

On August 29th, 1914, a combined naval and expeditionary force, organized by the Government of New Zealand
at the request of the British Imperial authorities, dropped anchor off Apia, the chief settlement
and seat of government of Samoa, the heart of the South Seas, administered by Germany under the provisions of the Samoan Convention of 1899.





In anticipation of the hostilities between the two Empires, the bulk of the reserve stamps
of German Samoan postage stamps in the familiar key-plate design showing the Imperial yacht __Hohenzollern__
under full steam, had been dispatched to the care of the German Consulate in a neutral oprt.
The remaining quantities on hand, were conveyed by the New zealand military authorities to the 
printing office of the local gazette, the _Samoanische Zeitung_, where they were converted (under Government control) by means of an 
overrprint consisting of the British Royal Cypher, __G.R.I.__ and a new value in English currency, into
a temporary issue under the new regime. Pending the preparation of these provisionals, an official notice
regarding postal matters was issued on August 29th as under:

<blockquote>
The German stamps in mark and pfenning values are from this date out of issue. Letters with the mark <strong>no stamps available</strong> are accepted
until the issue of intermediate stamps.
</blockquote>

A trial sheet of the 1d. on the 10 pfg. stamp was run off at the printing office,
but was rejected owing to the type used being too small a font, and
was destroyed without being placed on issue.
