In the interim, the consuls of Great Britain, Germany and the United States invited
a photographer in Samoa, John Davis, to establish a proper postal service to all countries.14

An order for a supply of stamps, in six denominations, was thereupon placed with the
New Zealand Printing Office in Wellington.15

The coconut palm being the principal wealth producer in the Pacific, a palm tree design,
engraved on a matrix die by A. E. Cousins, was adopted. The sheets were printed from
electrotype plates on paper, perforated Yl\, having the single-line 'NZ and Star' watermark.

In 1886, John Davis received his formal appointment as 'Postmaster for the Kingdom of
Samoa' from King Malietoa Laupepa and the palm tree issue was given official recognition.
16 Supplies were first put on sale in February, 1887. In subsequent issues, the
watermark and perforations were altered.17

As the Palm Tree issues had only limited franking power,18 stamps of the country of
delivery or transit (supplies of which could sometimes be bought at the consulates in Samoa)
were needed too for more distant destinations. The 1887 combination cover on display, for
example, shows P. 12^ Palm Tree stamps with those of the United States alongside. (Fig. 2.)

Also on view is an 1888 cover with a P. 12 x 11 1/2 Palm Tree 6d. stamp cancelled at Apia on 1st March, in combination with a 5 cents and a 10 cents U.S. stamp. (Fig. 3.) A small printing in 1888 of a P. 12Â£ 6d. value, in brown lake, has been recorded.19
