## Samoa
### Early Mail
Contact with Europeans began in the early 18th century but did not intensify until the arrival of the British. In 1722, Dutchman Jacob Roggeveen was the first European to sight the islands. This visit was followed by the French explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1729-1811), the man who named them the \textit{Navigator Islands} in 1768.

The United States Exploring Expedition (1838-42) under Charles Wilkes reached Samoa in 1839 and appointed of Englishman John C. Williams as acting U.S. consul.

However this appointment was never confirmed by the U.S. State Department; John C. Williams was merely recognized as "Commercial Agent of the United States". A British consul was already residing at Apia.

### The Henry Nisbet Correspondence
Rev. Henry Nisbet, 1818-1876, was born in Glasgow and served as a missionary for the London Missionary Society in Samoa, arriving there in 1841. From 1868 to 1870 he travelled to England, Scotland and Canada and it was during this trip that his first wife Sarah, nee Crook, died and he remarried Lydie Lantaret in 1870, returning with her to Samoa. A large batch of his letters about 200 surfaced in 1973.
