\subsubsection{The 1934 Milford Expedition}

When his H.M.S. Milford (Commander, captain H.C. Phillips) with the 
pemission of the Norwegian Government visited the island in 1934
with Vice-Admiral Evans and scientists on board, the authority of 
the Norwegian Consul at the Cape was obtained to dispatch a mail while in
territorial waters.

1934 Norwegian Milford Expedition on Bouvet Island, 
four different mint Norwegian stamps (5\ore, 10\ore, 20\ore and 30\ore) 
overprinted "BOUVET/OYA" for use on the expedition's mail, 
quite scarce as only 400 each were produced of the 5\ore and 30\ore 
values for instance, o.g., h.r., fine; also including a rare 
bottom right corner sheet-margin block of the 10o similarly 
overprinted, o.g., n.h., very fine (Facit #BO1, 3-5).
Facit as n.h. 22,000SK. 
}


A handstamp with \textsc{BOUVET OYA} was struck on the current Norwegian
5, 7, 10, 20 and 30 ore stamps; the handstamp was destroyed on 
the ship sailing for home.

1934 Norwegian Milford Expedition on Bouvet Island, the set of 
five different Norwegian stamps (5o,, 7o, 10o, 20o and 30o) 
overprinted "BOUVET/OYA" for use on the expedition's mail, 
supplied by the Norwegian consul in Cape Town, all tied to 
an extremely rare cover posted on the return of the expedition 
to Cape Town, locally addressed to a Mr. & Mrs. Westwood, stamps 
cancelled by three strikes of "Cape Town/28.Fe.34/Paquebot" c.d.s., 
cover with some light wrinkles and folds both horizontally and
vertically, still quite fine; covers from this expedition, 
bearing the special expedition stamps, are terribly elusive; 
accompanying this exceptional cover is the original 
"H.M.S. Milford/Africa Station" imprinted letter enclosure 
stating "we have found Bouvet Island & to say this note is 
amongst the very first mail that has been sent from this Island, 
so besides these stamps on this letter being unique they 
will in all probability prove to be valuable"; further 
accompanied by a series of twelve different real photographs 
taken during the expedition. Est. $2,000-3,000

On arival at the Cape the mail was cancelled with a circular 
obliteration __CAPE PAQUEBOT__ with date __23 FEB 34__ within.

The numbers overprinted were: 

5 ore (400), 
7 ore (100), 
10 \ore (999), 
20 ore (799), 
30 ore (395), of which 268, 69, 305, 261, and 243 
respectively are said to
have been put to postal use.
