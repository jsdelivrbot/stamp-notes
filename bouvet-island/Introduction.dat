\chapter{Introduction to the Postal History of Bouvet Island}

The reason of this issue of the small island of Bouvet can be traced back to a visit by a British warship; the Shoreham class sloop HMS \textit{Milford} to the island \cite{lea2010}.

\subsubsection{The 1934 Milford Expedition}

When his H.M.S. Milford (Commander, captain H.C. Phillips) with the 
pemission of the Norwegian Government visited the island in 1934
with Vice-Admiral Evans and scientists on board, the authority of 
the Norwegian Consul at the Cape was obtained to dispatch a mail while in
territorial waters.

four different mint Norwegian stamps (5\ore, 10\ore, 20\ore and 30\ore) 
overprinted "BOUVET/OYA" for use on the expedition's mail, 
quite scarce as only 400 each were produced of the 5\ore and 30\ore 
values for instance, o.g., h.r., fine; also including a rare 
bottom right corner sheet-margin block of the 10o similarly 
overprinted, o.g., n.h., very fine (Facit #BO1, 3-5).

Bouvet Island had been a part of the Kingdom of [Norway](../norway/Introduction) since 23 January 1928 but the island had no inhabitants. The island was discovered by John-Baptiste Bouvet on 1 January 1739 and this was really a miracle as this sailor had stumbled on the only land between 20\degree west and 90\degree east. Jean-Baptiste was really looking for Terres Australes and a staging post for voyages to the Indies. 

In 1928 a Norwegian expedition landed on the island. At this time the island was named Bouvet√∏ya, or "Bouvet Island" in Norwegian.[4] After a dispute with the United Kingdom, it was declared a Norwegian dependency in 1930. It became a nature reserve in 1971.

A handstamp with \textsc{BOUVET OYA} was struck on the current Norwegian
5, 7, 10, 20 and 30 ore stamps; the handstamp was destroyed on 
the ship sailing for home.

1934 Norwegian Milford Expedition on Bouvet Island, the set of 
five different Norwegian stamps (5o,, 7o, 10o, 20o and 30o) 
overprinted "BOUVET/OYA" for use on the expedition's mail, 
supplied by the Norwegian consul in Cape Town, all tied to 
an extremely rare cover posted on the return of the expedition 
to Cape Town, locally addressed to a Mr. & Mrs. Westwood, stamps 
cancelled by three strikes of "Cape Town/28.Fe.34/Paquebot" c.d.s., 
cover with some light wrinkles and folds both horizontally and
vertically, still quite fine; covers from this expedition, 
bearing the special expedition stamps, are terribly elusive; 
accompanying this exceptional cover is the original 
"H.M.S. Milford/Africa Station" imprinted letter enclosure 
stating "we have found Bouvet Island & to say this note is 
amongst the very first mail that has been sent from this Island, 
so besides these stamps on this letter being unique they 
will in all probability prove to be valuable"; further 
accompanied by a series of twelve different real photographs 
taken during the expedition. Est. $2,000-3,000
}


On arival at the Cape the mail was cancelled with a circular 
obliteration __CAPE PAQUEBOT__ with date __23 FEB 34__ within.

The numbers overprinted and the numbers used are shown in \ref{table1}.

30 ore &395  &143 \\
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The rarity of the issue can be seen by the small numbers overprinted and the even smaller numbers actually used. Copies do appear on the market from time to time in unused state which would suggest that some members of the expdition brought these stamps home as souvenirs.

Covers bearing the set of five are the most common form of seeing this issue used and all postally used items, whether of philatelic or normal postal use, bear the Cape Town paquebot cancellation which was applied to the crew's mail when the ship arrived back at its base there. Any without this cancellation must be considered forgeries or creations. The Facit catalogue describes the issue as being private whilst Gibbons says 'can hardly be regarded as official'.
