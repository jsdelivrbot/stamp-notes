1854 Tasmanian Courier 4d bright orange with a good clear and virtually complete strike of the rare First Allocation Barred Numeral '72', margins just clear to large. A desirable relic from the second period as a convict settlement and a key item for any Norfolk Island collection or a "social philately" collection of the convict era. The settlement was abandoned in 1855, so the numeral was used for less than one year. [A superior item to Stephen Bradford's very fine strike on a 4d cut-to-shape that sold for $1400 at our auction of 9/11/2002. His very fine pair with two strikes sold for $7840]
