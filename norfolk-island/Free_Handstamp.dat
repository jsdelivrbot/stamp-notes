Description:1842 OHMS entire endorsed "Manifest of Cargo/Govr Phillip/6th Jany 1842" at lower-left, to "The Colonial Secretary/Sydney" with a very fine strike - and the only recorded example - of the rounded-boxed 'FREE/NORFOLK ISLAND' handstamp in red, '[crown]/GENERAL POST OFFICE/JA*13/1842/SYDNEY' arrival backstamp. A great rarity and one of the most important covers not just of Norfolk Island but of the New South Wales pre-stamp period. 
Collas & Breckon state that only three covers from this period have been recorded. This item is illustrated by them at page 7 and captioned "...the only recorded usage".}
