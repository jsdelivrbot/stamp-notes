Description:HARRISON PRESENTATION PROOFS: [All the lots in this section are imperforate singles or se-tenant pairs affixed to Harrison & Sons presentation cards (102x128mm with bevelled corners). Numbering 128 proofs, this is by far the largest such holding we have encountered. Stephen Bradford had "only" 43 such items. The only significant overlap with that selection is the 1976-77 Butterflies & Moths set]
