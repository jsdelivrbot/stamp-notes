Description:1953 Pictorials 3Â½d to 5/- complete die proofs in the issued colours recessed in a single thick card mount (175x127mm), six boxed 'CBA/NOTE PRINTING/BRANCH' cachets on the reverse annotated with the numbers of proofs produced & the dates on which they were pulled. The mount itself has aged but the proofs themselves exhibit the original colours and are of fine to very fine appearance. [The only example known to us. In our opinion, the mount should be opened and the proofs removed]}
