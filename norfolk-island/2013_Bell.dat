# 2013 Church Bell, Norfolk Island Issue, 9th April 2013

This bell was cast at the Russell Foundry Sydney in the 1800's, this bell is thought to be the one used at Government house to signal each hour and then maybe also used at the Melanesian Mission (1867-1920) as the dinner bell. Now it is installed back down Kingston at the All Saints Church outside the commissariat store compound.
This bell used to be rung to mark the passing of a parishioner but this practice seems to have passed as well and the bell has not been heard for some time, however it did recently receive a birthday where it got a clean and a new stainless steel mount to replace the old steel corroded one.

Sneak up and ring it when nobody is watching but don't get caught Hehee!
