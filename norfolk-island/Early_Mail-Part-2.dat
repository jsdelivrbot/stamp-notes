Description:1851 lengthy letter (without the envelope) to John Adams (the Younger), headed "Honolulu, Sandwich Islands/May 31st 1851", a bit soiled but largely fine and wholly legible, a second sheet - with de Thierry's signature - missing though the four pages that remain have wonderful content: "...There is an impression here among the white people that...one could employ a family of Pitcairn people...I would be the first to warn you against such an offer, as it would inevitably break you up as a community...i want to see you employers and not employed for others...The [Hawaiian] population is fast breaking up...owing to the maladies introduced here...In morality the people are sadly degraded, and I would dread to see your exemplary families thrown into contact with those of the native race...how long these islands will be under a native king is a matter of the greatest uncertainty. The King is forever getting himself into trouble with European nations...The Americans have long had an eye to these islands...I shall remain at Honolulu 10 or 12 months longer, having promised the French Consul to act as chancellor of the consulate until his return from Paris where he is gone to try to obtain the settlement of the difficulties with King Kamehamaha III...Mr Brodie published it as his opinion that Norfolk Island would be the best of all places for you...at Norfolk Island you would to all futurity be branded with convict association being the place to which doubly convicted criminals are sent. It would indeed be a sorry choice for the descendants of the mutineers of Bounty...Some people here are of opinion that you must remain a secluded community, but that too is a very fatal error...more of the European stock must be allied to you by marriage, or else your own race will degenerate and fall back with every generation not only in the body but also in the mind. You are, as it were, one family, and constant succession of unions with each other must ultimately bring many evils down upon you..." ÞÞ[Given what has been learned in recent years of the "moral degradation" on Pitcairn, this was indeed a prescient commentary. The Encyclopedia of New Zealand states that de Thierry was French consul in Honolulu from late-1850 until March 1853, after which he returned to Auckland.
