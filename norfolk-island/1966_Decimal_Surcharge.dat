1966 Decimal Surcharges '2c' on 2d Lagunaria complete horizontal strip of 10, the last unit with Silver Overprint bt '2c' Surcharge Omitted, unmounted. Rare, and still unlisted by Gibbons, despite being one of the foremost errors of Norfolk Island. [Collas & Breckon at p64 state "One sheet had the first overprint (silver panel) in the right position, but the '2c' oveprint was omitted from the right-hand vertical row of six stamps." It is important to note that this is a genuine "Omitted Overprint" and not just the result of the overprint being misaligned, such as the great Fiji and New Hebrides errors that Gibbons do list! Stephen Bradford's similar strip sold for $2760 at our auction of 9/11/2002]
