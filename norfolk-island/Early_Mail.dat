Description:1857 two-page letter (without the envelope) to Charles Philip Hippolytus Baron de Thierry (in New Zealand) headed "Norfolk Island/May 19th 1857" and signed "Ruth Quintal", an intimate missive that hints at more than just a social acquaintance: "...I still fondly think of the happy hours we have spent in your agreeable society at Pitcairn...I am sure your good heart will make up what is wanting in this letter. Surely you will not attribute it to lack of affection...believe me to be yours ever truly and affectionately", minor wrinkling and soiling but wholly legible.

Description:1863 four-page 8vo letter (without the envelope) to Baron de Thierry (in New Zealand) headed "Norfolk Island/May 22nd 1863" and signed "George H Nobbs", multiple folds & overall soiling still entirely legible. [George Hunn Nobbs was the effective leader of the Pitcairn community and supervised their relocation to Norfolk. He arrived on Pitcairn in 1828 and quickly assumed the roles of schoolteacher & pastor, though it was only in 1852 that he travelled to England to be ordained. This letter highlights the dangers to the Pitcairners of disease: "...We are in continual dread of the introduction of Variola [smallpox] as a great number of our little ones have not been vaccinated...We have a great deal of sickness introduced from Auckland, the Bay [of Islands] and Monganui, and shall continue to be so infected...so long as...trading vessels visit us so frequently. One half of the school children, and many grown persons are...suffering from Catarrh or Influenza, myself among their number..." Nobbs died on Norfolk in 1884.

Description:1850 (late) undated letter (without the envelope) to Baron de Thierry at Honolulu, headed "Pitcairns Island" & signed "George H Nobbs", a bit worn and some minor repairs effected with archival tape but wholly legible. This is a marvellous document in which the removal of the Pitcairners to Norfolk Island in 1856 is foreshadowed. Nobbs states "I most sincerely console with you on the loss of your property on board of the Noble and also of the failure of prospects in California...I trust that in Honolulu you will find a more eligible a place for your various and valuable talents...in regard to the future destinies of the people under my care, there is a report extant that her majesty's government have in contemplation to expatriate them to Norfolk Island, first removing the members of the penal settlement...it would be the best suited...of any spot on the inhabitable globe..." George Hunn Nobbs, who had served in both the British & Chilean navies, arrived at Pitcairn in 1828 & quickly assumed the roles of schoolteacher & pastor. Over time he became the effective leader of the community and supervised their transfer to Norfolk, where he remained after 16 of the islanders returned to Pitcairn in 1859, followed by a further 4 families in 1864]}
