\chapter{Kavalla}  

Kavala (Greek: Καβάλα) is a city in northern Greece, the principal seaport of eastern Macedonia and the capital of Kavala regional unit. It is situated on the Bay of Kavala, across from the island of Thasos. Kavala is located on the Egnatia motorway and is a one and a half-hour drive to Thessaloniki (160 kilometres (99 miles) west) and a forty-minute drive to Drama (37 km (23 miles) north) and Xanthi (56 km (35 miles) east). Its nickname is The cyan city (Η γαλάζια πόλη).


When Greece took control of Kavala in June of 1913, stamps of Bulgaria were overprinted ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΙΟΙΚΗΣΙΣ (Greek Administration) and surcharged into Greek currency (lepta and drachma). Ten stamps were overprinted in a bright red, and one in blue.

The stamps were released on 1 July, 1913.

It is most likely these were the only stamps available for overprint at the time to resume postal service as soon as possible. The surcharged Bulgarian stamps were replaced by stamps of Greece in early 1914.

Kavalla was also one of the four French Post Offices in the Ottoman period that issued  their own stamps between 1893 and 1903: [Cavalle](../cavalle/introduction) (present-day Kavala), Dedeagh (Dedeagatch, present-day Alexandroupoli), Port Lagos, and Vathy (Samos).
