# The Stamps and Postal History of Romagna


Romagna was one of the Papal States until 12th June 1859, when a provisional government was formed to prepare for union with Sardinia.

As Avery Taylor noted over 135 years age: The stamps of Romagna seemed at one time to be destined to become rare. They wrere scarce at a time when the issues of Parma, Modena,
and Tuscany were common, and it might reasonably have been supposed, seeing
how short was the period of their currency, that they would constantly increase
in value. But not only is it possible at the present time to obtain questionable reprints
at a nominal price, the far more valuable obliterated specimens are also to be had for a
few pence, and are much more frequently met with than, for example, the upright
Oldenburgs. That so large a number of stamps should have been employed in the course of five or six months in a province by no means remarkable for its commercial importance,
is surprising ; yet the fact, as apparently evidenced by the commonness of most, if not all the values, remains.

The emission of the series took place, as
everyone knows, shortly after the inauguration
of the provisional government of
Romagna. The people of that province,
seeing the success which had attended the
struggle for liberty in the north of Italy,
took it into their heads to free themselves
from the Papal yoke, and their unceremonious
action in the matter was viewed
with, no great satisfaction by the diplomatic
world. Out of the Napoleonic idea of a free
Italy from the Alps to the Adriatic was
growing a greater idea, that of a free Italy
throughout the regions traversed by the
Apennines. They who had set the ball
rolling were astonished at tlie momentum, it
had acquired, and would, perhaps, have been
glad to arrest its progress, but that could
not be done. The Romaguese, after a short
struggle, gained their liberty, and, as a necessary
preliminary to union with Piedmont,
a temporary government was established.

From that government (to return to things
postal) emanated, on the 2nd July, 1859, a request
to Professor Sil vessi Gherardi to furnish
a design for the stamps of the emancipated
provinces. Professor Gherardi, an inhabitant
of Turin, appears to have taken no
notice of the order. The government then
applied to the Turin post-office, and the authorities
there sent a set of Sardinian
stamps to serve as models for the projected
set ; but apparently the designs did not find
favour at Bologna, for, instead of adopting a
type adorned with the king's portrait, the
Romagna administration took refuge in the
above unpretending and unlovely device.
It may be conjectured that considerations of
economy had something to do with the decision,
which was taken after an inspection of
a series of proofs struck in black on colour.

The article from which these particulars 
are taken* states that the printing of the
stamps was undertaken by a Bologna firm,
that of Tinto and Merlain, and that the casts
were made by Amoretti Brothers, also of
Bologna. The sheets are divided into two
parts, each containing six rows of ten stamps.
The decree authorising the emission reads
as follows :—

The stamps were denominated in bajocchi (100 bajocchi - 1 scudo)

The values of the stamps are as follows:


\begin{tabular}{ll}
1/2  baioccho &lemon.\\
1  baiccho  &iron-grey.\\
2 baiocchi  &dark yellow\\
3           &dark green.\\
4           &red-brown.\\
5           &dull lilac.\\
6           &light green.\\
8           &rose.\\
20          &light blue\\
\end{tabular}

The employment of the 6 baj. has never
been proved, though the writer from whom I
quote is of opinion that that value was issued
with the others. He bases his argument
on the founders' (Amoretti Bros.) invoice
for the casts, in which those of the
6 baj. and 8 baj. are entered as having been
delivered together to the printers ; and, if
delivered to the printers together, why should
not the supplies of the two values have been
struck off together ? This chain of reasoning
is obviously incomplete. It certainly
does not prove the simultaneous issue of the
6 baj. and 8 baj. ; it only creates a presumption
to that effect, which is weakened by the
fact that no used specimens of the 6 baj.
are known.

The stamp in used condition in rare and demands prices around which at the end of 2015 demanded 3000 EU on piece.

The entire series was withdrawn on the
31st January, 1860, in execution of a decree
of the governor of the Emilian provinces,
dated the 12th of the same month, though a
delay of two months was allowed for the exchange
of the stamps against those of
Sardinia, which were appointed to supersede
them.

After the suppression of the stamps (says
the writer already quoted from) the dies,
badly packed, were forwarded to Turin, and
arrived there in bad condition, most of them
having had the corners knocked off during
the journey. A postal employe, Mr. J.
Gozo, nevertheless obtained from the dies a
number of impressions in all colours, his
practice being to unite all the values and
print them off on the same sheet. Later on,
desiring to hide the defects presented by the
stamps printed from deteriorated dies, Gozo
got an engraver to add an outside frame,
consisting of six to seven thin lines. The
impressions from these manipulated dies
are worthless.
