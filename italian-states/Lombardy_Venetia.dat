\chapter{Italian States} 
In 1815 the Treaty of Vienna joined Lombardy and Venetia as a Kingdom under the control of Austria. Lombardy became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1859, and Venetia became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866.

The stamps were as issued for Austria, but denominated initially in centesimi (100 centesimi = 1 Austrian Lire = 0.865 Italian Lire) changing to soldi in 1858 (100 soldi = 1 florin = 2.47 Italian lire)
