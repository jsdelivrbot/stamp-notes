##Italy: Stamps and Postal History 

###Modena
The Duchy of Modena introduced adhesive stamps in June 1852.
Messrs Rinaldi and Algery engraved the dies and manufactured the electrotypes, 
from which the stamps were typographed at the Modenese State Printing Office.
The stamps were printed in black on coloured paper and featured the arms of the ducal house of Este (hence the inscription "Poste Estensi").
A 10c. stamp printed on lilac, instead of rose paper, was issued in November 1857 for use on newspapers transmitted by post.
