The Pontifical State once comprised 16,000 square miles of central Italy [Fig 1] over which the Pope had ruled as a temporal sovereign for more than a millennium.  It was bounded on the north by the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venice and the Duchy of Modena, on the west by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and on the southeast by the Kingdom of Naples. The population of the country was just over 3,000,000 persons.



The philatelic period of Pontifical State history (1852-1870) is a time of 
great historical interest because it coincides with the struggle for unity 
in the Italian peninsula.  During this whole period, the reigning Pontiff was Pius IX (crowned 21 June 1846).  
Three years into his reign, Italian nationalist ferment led to public 
disorder in Rome and the declaration of a "Roman Republic"
under Mazzini and Garibaldi.

Pius IX was trapped in the Quirinal Palace by a mob of radicals and forced to flee south to Gaeta.  
Although French troops under Louis Napoleon Bonaparte eventually put down this revolt, 
it was a sign of the ultimate downfall of the old political system in Italy.

In 1859 the northernmost section of the Pontifical State, Romagna, declared its independence. Shortly afterward the central portion, the Marches and Umbria, also broke away.  This left only the portion surrounding Rome itself [3].  Although French and Austrian infantry were again called in to maintain order, Rome fell to Sardinian troops on 20 September 1870.  This event, which Italian nationalists regarded as a liberation, was in fact an invasion and a conquest.  Pope Pius declared himself "the prisoner of the Vatican" and sequestered himself in the Lateran Palace to protest the loss of his realm by force of arms, creating a seemingly irreconcilable dispute with the Italian government known as the "Roman Question".

THE ISSUE OF 1852

These political events are reflected in the postage stamps of the country.  On 21 November 1851, Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli announced the introduction of bolli franchi (postage stamps) in the Pontifical State. Various regulations concerning rates and usage were published and the accepted design showed the chiavi decussate (crossed keys of St. Peter) surmounted by the triregno (triple tiara) which had for centuries been the official coat of arms of the popes [4].

 

The Palazzo Madama was the home of the pontifical post office from 1851 to 1870.  Today it is the meeting place of the Italian Senate.  Click to enlarge.

Each value has a different border and bears the inscription "FRANCO BOLLO POSTALE'' and the value in bajocchi (100 baj. to the scudo). The values from \frac12 to 7 bajocchi were issued on 1 January 1852, printed in black on colored paper. Three higher values were added later in the same year: the 8 baj. black on white paper (October 1); the 50 baj. blue on white paper; and the 1 scudo carmine rose on white paper (both July 12).

 

The dies were engraved by Doublet and Decoppet and Co. and the stereotypes derived by the foundry of P. Couppet and Co., both of Rome. The paper, made mostly by Cartiera Graziosi of Subiaco, was at first handmade; later smoother and heavier machine-made paper was employed. The values up to 8 baj. were typographed at the Vatican's own print shop in sheets of 100 (divided into four panes of 25).  The 50 baj. and 1 scudo were printed in sheets of 50 (10 x 5) without any division into panes. The \frac12, 1, 3, 4, and 8 baj. values, since they were designed with curved outer borders, were printed with straight separation lines between the stamps as an aid in cutting. The 1 baj. occurs in two compositions, one in which the cutting lines are continuous vertically and interrupted horizontally and a second with the opposite arrangement.
