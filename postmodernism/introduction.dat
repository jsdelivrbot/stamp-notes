\chapter{Introduction}

I have joined Professor's Roth's course for Post Modernism, more as
a distraction to work. The course started well with two videos, which are
interesting and professional.

One has to read the background literature and as the good Professor did
not find it necessary to define what is the course about and what is post 
Modernism, here is the beginning of the Wikipedia definition, which was alarming
to say the least:

\begin{quotation}
This article contains weasel words: vague phrasing that often accompanies biased or unverifiable information. Such statements should be clarified or removed.
\end{quotation}

On a series of lectures that started with the question "What is Enlightment"
to be reading a description that the information might be biased did not go well 
with me. Neither did the last paragraph:

\begin{quotation}
Criticism of postmodernism [are] intellectually diverse, including the assertions that postmodernism is meaningless and promotes obscurantism. For example, philosopher Noam Chomsky has argued that postmodernism is meaningless because it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge. He asks why postmodernist intellectuals do not respond like people in other fields when asked, "what are the principles of their theories, on what evidence are they based, what do they explain that wasn't already obvious, etc?...If [these requests] can't be met, then I'd suggest recourse to Hume's advice in similar circumstances: to the flames."[38]
\end{quotation}

Formal, academic critiques of postmodernism can also be found in works such as 
\textit{Beyond the Hoax} and \textit{Fashionable Nonsense}. I checked to see, if
these are on the list of prescribed books and they are not. Nevertheless I decided
to buy them on ebay. With some luck they should be here in two to three weeks.

Reading in between the lines it tries to define what made my generation and what
influenced affected thinking. If you are wondering I am a baby boomer, even if I
do not agree with the definition as my father's father had many more kids than 
my father and the same was true of all my peers at the time.
