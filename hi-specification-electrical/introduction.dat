###ELECTRICAL TESTING 


###PART 1 GENERAL 


1.1 General Instructions 

1.1.1 Works under this section shall be governed by Conditions of Contract and section of 
division 1. 

\subsection{1.2 Scope}

1.2.1 After completion of the Electrical Work, the complete systems shall be tested thoroughly before commissioning. Any modifications or repairs necessary on completion of the tests shall be done at the Sub-Contractor's expense. 

1.2.2 The tests outlined herein shall be in addition to, and not substitution for, the tests of the individual items at the man ufacture r's plant. Insulation and grounding resistance test shall be made before operating tests. Proper rotation shall be determined before permanent connections are made. 

1.2.3 All testing equipment on Site shall be provided by the electrical Sub-Contractor. 

1.2.4 The Sub-Contractor shall make the necessary openings in the circuits, for the testing 
instruments and shall place and connect all instruments, equipment, and devices 
necessary for the tests. Upon completion of the tests , these shall be removed and all 
circuits shall be re-connected to their permanent condition. 

1.2.5 The tests shall be conducted in the presence of the Engineer and/or local power 
authorities representative. The Engineer shall be notified seven calendar days or more in 
advance when any test is to take place, and it shall not be started without his permission . 

1.2.6 Cert ificates w hen so required shall be submitted for any equipment installed under this 
con tract originating from an authorized inspecting body in the country of the manufacturer. 

1.2.7 Unless otherwise specified, the Sub-Contractor shall supply the electric current necessary 
for the tests. 

1.2.8 The Sub-Contrac tor shall state and guarantee the part iculars as specified in his tender 
documents. Such guarantees shall not be departed from , without w ritten permission by 
the Engineer. If such guarantees are not respected, the Engineer has the right to 
reject the faulty equipment. 

1.2.9 The Sub-Contractor shall submit four copies of all tests results. Test shall include the following: 

1.2.10 Insulation megger tests on wires & cables. 

1.2.10.1 Continuity and resistance tests.

1.2.10.2 Socket outlets proper wiring tests. 

1.2.10.3 Operational tests on all electrical equipment.

1.2.10.4 Insulation resistance tests of motors, distribution boards and panels.

1.2.10.5 Test ing of lighting installations. 

1.2.10.6 Earth loop impedance test for socket outlets. 

1.2.10.7 Earth resistance measurementstest for HV/LV.

1.2.10.8 Thermo-graphic testing of the electrical boards/rising mains

1.2.10.9 Thermo-graphic testing of the electrical boards/rising mains. 

\section{1.3 Description of Tests and Methods} 

1.3.1 Insulation Megger Tests 

1.3.1.1 Tests for insulation level shall be a 500-volt Megger. A minimum of one megohm 
(1,000,000 ohms) applying to the complete installation shall be obtained . This means 
that when all the phase wires at the panelboard are connected together and to the 
testing instrument, all switches closed. all appliances Inserted in the circuit, all neutral 
wires left in the air, and the other end of the Megger Is connected to the grounding, then 
there shall be a minimum of 1 megohm between the whole of the installation taken 
together and the grounding. 

1.3.2 Continuity & Resistance Tests 

1.3.2.1 A continuity test to ensure that all connections have been made properly shall be 
made. This can be done by the use of a bell set. Test shall also include ensuring all 
switches and other interrupting devices breaking the phase wire and not the neutral wire. 

1.3.2.2 Test shall include, in addition to checking continuity of current carrying wires and 
cables, continuity of grounding conductors. This shall be done through a Megger which 
shall produce an alternating current of a magnitude equal to one and a half times the 
rating of the circuit under test with a maximum of 25 amps. 

1.3.3 Socket outlets Proper Wiring Test 

1.3.3.1 All socket outlets shall be connected properly such that looking at the face of the socket 
outlet the live connection shall be on the right, the neutral on the left and the earthing at the 
top. 

1.3.4 Operational Tests 

1.3.4.1 The Contractor shall demonstrate the proper operation of circuit breakers, switches 
and any other equipment as requested by the Engineer, or as specified elsewhere in 
these Specifications. 

1.3.4.2 Each motor and associated equipment shall be run as nearly as possible under 
normal operating conditions for as long a time as is necessary to demonstrate correct 
alignment. wiring capacity, speed, and satisfactory operation. The motor shall be 
loaded to full capacity, or as near there to as possible. 

1.3.5 Insulation Resistance Tests of Motors 

1.3.5.1 All motors shall be tested for insulation in accordance with the requirement of 
Standard Two copies of the test data shall be submitted. 
IEC 

1.3.6 Testing of Lighting Installation 

1.3.6.1 The Contractor shall demonstrate the proper operation of all lighting fixtures. 

1.3.7 Thermo-Graphic Testing 

1.3.7.1 Thermo-graphlc testing shall be performed using thermal imaging camera for the critical/ 
important equipment/installation while the equipment are operational.
