##1906 Second Olympics
The Intercalated Olympic Games were to be a series of International Olympic Games half-way between what we now call Games of the Olympiad. The series of Intercalated Games was to always be held in Athens, and were 
to have equal status with the international games. 
In fact, the only such games were held in Greece in 1906. They subsequently came to be known as the tenth anniversary
of the First Olympics.
