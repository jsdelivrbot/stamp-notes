The National Republican Greek League , Ethnikos Dimokratikos Ellinikos Syndesmos, abbreviated EDES) was one of the major resistance groups formed during the Axis Occupation of Greece during World War II. The largest of the non-communist resistance groups, it concentrated its military activities in Epirus. From 1943 onwards, came into confrontation with the Communist-led National Liberation Front, beginning a series of civil conflicts that would lead to the Greek Civil War.

###Foundation and ideology

The National Republican Greek League was founded on 9 September 1941 by a former army officer, Colonel {{wi:Napoleon_Zervas}}, and two of his friends, Leonidas Spais and Ilias Stamatopoulos.[1]

Like many other resistance movements founded during that time, the political orientation of the National Republican Greek League was Republican, with a strong dislike towards the exiled King, George II, and featured some vague leftist/socialist tendencies. In the aftermath of the four-year right-wing Metaxas Dictatorship, which was strongly supported by the King, the monarchy was almost universally rejected, while leftist and social ideals for "social fairness" became the vogue among the various resistance groups.

The founding charter of EDES explicitly demanded the "establishment in Greece of a Republican regime, of Socialist form", the "revelation [...] of the treason of former King George II and the gang of the 4th of August Dictatorship", calling for a thorough cleansing of the state and Greek social and public life from anyone "who has not proven a National Republican [and] socialist conscience through actions". The charter also established the exiled Venizelist general Nikolaos Plastiras as its nominal political head, without the latter's consent or even knowledge.[1] Remarkably, no reference to armed opposition against the occupying forces was made in the text.[1]

On the same day, Komninos Pyromaglou, a friend and assistant of Plastiras, left Nice, where Plastiras resided, for Greece. He was authorize by the general to form, on his behalf, a republican organization with socialist content", and prepare to turn both "against the Occupier" and against a return of the monarchy.[2] After his arrival in Athens on 23 September, Pyromaglou came into contact with Republican circles, and was eventually persuaded by Zervas to join EDES. In October, a five-member Executive Committee was founded, with Pyromaglou as General Secretary and Zervas as a simple member.[3]

As the organization grew, it established links with the British Headquarters in Cairo, with a view to receiving funds, weapons and guidance. Because the British strongly supported the Greek monarchy, Zervas quietly sent a statement of loyalty to King George II in March 1942.[4] This marked a remarkable but silent breach with the vitriolic anti-monarchist attacks of the past months, and began the slow but inexorable turn of EDES towards a pro-British and pro-monarchist stance that would also lead to a direct confrontation with the greatest resistance movement, the leftist National Liberation Front (EAM).
