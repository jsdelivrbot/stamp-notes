The series consisted of twelve values (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 40 and 60 lepta, 1, 2, 5 and 10 drachmae). There were eight different designs, by Professor I. Svoronos, which included famous sports-related images from ancient Greece, such as a chariot race and Myron's Discobolus. The stamps were designed by Swiss artist A. Guilleron, the steel dies were created by the French engraver Louis-EugÃ¨ne Mouchon, (1843-1914) and printing tooks place at the National Printing Office of France. The stamps were delivered in perforated sheets (13Â½ x 14). The name E. MOUCHON appears at the bottom side of each stamp. The 1986 Olympics stamps, of which the 5 and 10 drachmas denominations are relatively rare, 
remain popular with collectors of topical stamps relating to sports and Olympic games.</p>
