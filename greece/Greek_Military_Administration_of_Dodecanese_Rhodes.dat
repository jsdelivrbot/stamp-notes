Registered cover from Rhodes to Liberec (Czechoslovakia), bearing 10d. on 2,000d. strip of five, tied by ''Rodos'' cds's, showing Prague transit on back. A very scarce destination, possessing the remarkable significance of being dispatched on the second day of issue. Sa. 1. Estimate &euro;250.}

\figurecenter1[70%]{1513.jpg}{Lot: 1513 1947, April 18. Cover from Rhodes addressed to the 211 Transit Camp of the Middle East Forces at Ismailia (Egypt), properly franked by 10d. on 2,000d. single example and block of four from the upper left corner of the sheet, tied by ''Rodos'' cds's, with British ''Army Post office'', Cairo and Ismailia datestamps on reverse. A spectacular franking in the first month of issue to a rare military destination, very desirable. Sa. 1. Estimate &euro;200.}

\figurecenter1[70%]{1514.jpg}{Lot: 1514 1947, April 7.

\figurecenter1[70%]{1515.jpg}{Lot: 1515 1947, May 11. Large envelope from Rhodes via airmail to Springfield (Mass., United States), franked by 10d. on 2,000d., silver overprint, block of 20 from the upper right corner of the sheet, tied by ''Rodos'' cds's, with Greece 1946-47 50d. on 1l. charity adhesive on back which was not cancelled. We can not assure with all confidence that this letter was dispatched in May, since the Roman ''I'' figure in the datestamp seems to have been misplaced to the left, thus resulting in ''1I V'' instead of ''1 IV'' which represent day and month; in this case, this mail would have been consigned to the post on the first day of the Greek administration. To our knowledge, this is the largest franking known bearing this adhesive, undoubtedly being one of the most impressive frankings in this interesting and short period in the History of the Dodecanese. Sa. 1. Estimate &euro;1000.}
