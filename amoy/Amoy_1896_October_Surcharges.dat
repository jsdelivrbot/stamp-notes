The surcharge with the dropped
"C" 10c. on 25c in multiples is very scarce with only ten examples of
the blue surcharge believed to exist. 
In the figure from the ... From the unique Oldfield sheet, later acquired by Sutherland 
and split into smaller multiples by Livingston (see Charles Dougan, p. 23).

The 6cents surcharge also resulted in a number of varieties, as to be expected
from the poor overprinting used. Unlike the earlier dropped "C" surcharges whose 
new values and 
bars were surcharged in two operations, the level "C" stamps 
were surcharged in one operation (see Charles Dougan, pp. 23-24). 
On this stamp, the entire surcharge was shifted upward, so two printer's 
slugs were applied over each of the "20" numerals. Unlisted in Livingston 
and Charles 
Dougan. An example which appears to be unique is shown in figure 3 and appeared in
the The William L. Kullman Collection of the Local Posts, December 2012, Inter-Asia auction .
