\chapter{Ryukyu Islands}  

The Ryukyu Islands are a chain of islands in the western Pacific Ocean, on the eastern limit of the East China Sea and to the southwest of the island of Kyushu in Japan. The largest of the islands is Okinawa Island. The Ryukyu Kingdom was formally annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1872, although the kingdom had been part of the feudal Satsuma Domain in Kyushu since 1609. During World War II, the islands came under the occupation of the United States military in 1945, and a civilian government was set up under American control in 1952. The islands reverted the control of Japan in 1972.

The Ryukyu Islands were incorporated into the Japanese empire in 
1879. Prior to this date the Ryukyu Islands paid tribute to both China and 
Japan. 

  The United States occupied these islands in 1945. Under the peace 
treaty with the Japanese, the Allies, effective 1952, the islands were 
administered by the United States under a United Nations trusteeship. In 
1953, the Amani Islands were returned by the US to Japan. The remainder of 
the archipelago, including Okinawa,  was returned by the US to Japan in 
1972. While the US returned Okinawa  to Japan in 1972, it retained its 
military bases on the island; a matter which would later generate much local 
tension. 

Between 1948 and 1972 the stamps are listed in the Scott Catalogue  as US Possessions. These 
stamps are quite colorful and provide the interested collector with a wide 
variety of types, color varieties and provisional issues. During this period 
there were really four different stamp issuing authorities. 

These authorities 
included: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item US Military Government

\item the US Civil Administration

\item Ryukyu Provisional Central Government 

\item the Government of the Ryukyu Islands. 
\end{enumerate}

1972, after which time stamps of Japan were valid.
