\chapter{1948 Eleuthera}  

As Governor of the Bahamas this set was the brain-child of the 
late Edward VIII, as a way to promote the islands. The stamps 
were printed by the Canadian Bank Note Co. who were on good 
terms with The Governor and Mrs. Simpson. Why so many 
values? The Crown Agents refused to pay the costs of what they 
saw as a silly endeavour. So the Governor lavished his own 
cash on the project. The carmine-red £5 value showed Nassau 
International Airport, but was refused issue by the UPU on the 
grounds that it:– 

a) it blatantly advertised Pan American Airways 

b) showed the fluttering Stars and Stripes and 

c) used a value with no postal validity.
