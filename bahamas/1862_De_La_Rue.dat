\chapter{1862 De La Rue}    

Within a few months after the transfer of the Perkins Bacon plates to Messrs De La Rue & Co, the firm was ready to start printing the Bahamas postage stamps. As a  first step they took their own proofs and these consisted of 1d. (red), 4d. (rose), and 6d. lilac---i.e., in issued colours. As it was the custom of De La Rue, these were printed on thick highly glazed card.


The first stamps to be printed De la Rue from the Bacon Perkins plates  were the
One Penny, Fourpence and Sixpence. Easton records that they were invoiced on
July 10, 1862. This first printing was on paper that had no watermark. Of course the sheet of papers, although not having a regular watermark, as is commonly understood, the paper-maker's watermark "T. Saunders 1860" spread across the sheet. Letters of these watermark appear behing certain stamps and provide a convenient means to plate the stamps.

Easton (Easton, p.258), based on the invoice of the stamps and the invoice for 
the paper, estimated that the quantities printed were,

\begin{tabular}{l}
10/7/62; 4920, One Penny; 3060 FourPence; 2040 Sixpence;\\
1/10/62; 5040, One Penny; 3000 FourPence; 2040 Sixpence;\\
14/1/63; 6220, One Penny; 3120 FourPence; 2220 Sixpence;\\
\end{tabular}

There are three catalogued perforations for the issue.
