for the Colonies.

Like the first Colonial Head thsi new die is also coincidental in line with the Joubert head for the Great Britain Fourpence, but it shows a broader treatment by the engraver, who probably also worked on the head while he was engraving the new diadem. This new die is known to collectors as the 'New Colonial Die B'.
