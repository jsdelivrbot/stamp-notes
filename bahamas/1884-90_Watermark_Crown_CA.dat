\chapter{1894-90 Watermark Crown CA} 

The requisition for new postage duties for One Pound and Five Shillings from the Bahamas was sent to De La Rue
on August 14, 1883. The specimens enclosed showed the large Official Receipt size for the One Pound, and an
unusual size for the Five Shillings.

De La Rue prepared designs and submitted an estimate on August 20th 1893. The size suggested for the Five Shillings was that of the normal postage stamp, and its colour was blue. The Crown Agents reply asked for an estimate
for a key-plate and dutyplate design, and asked that the colour of the Five Shillings be changed so as to leave blue
for a possible Twopence halfpenny in the future.

\begin{quotation}
Should the Government of Bahamas decide upon having a Key-plate, they would derive the advantage of only to have to go to the expense of \pound12 for any new duty of the Postage stamp size which they might require, and further it would enable them to abandon at a very small cost the copperplate process of printing which is still used for several of their duties, but to which, as you are aware there are objections.
\end{quotation}    

By 5 March, De La Rue were able to strike a proof from the new Master die.
