## East Africa and Uganda
East Africa and Uganda Protectorates was the name used by the combined postal service of the protectorates of British East Africa and Uganda between 1901 and 1920, when British East Africa was split into the colony and protectorate of Kenya

The administration issued postage stamps with the profile of King Edward VII and inscribed "EAST AFRICA AND UGANDA PROTECTORATES" in 1903. The same basic design was used throughout the period, with new watermark and colours in 1904 and 1907, respectively, and the substitution of King George V in 1912. The 6c stamp was surcharged 4c in 1919.

While the lower-denomination stamps are common, stamps of up to 500 rupees were sold, primarily for use as revenue stamps. Postal usages of the higher values are scarce and valuable.

In 1902 the postal systems of B.E.A. and Uganda were amalgamated the two protectorates now forming the the East Africa
and Uganda Protectorates.

In July 1920, the Protectorate of B.E.A. was raised to the status of Crown Colony under the title of Kenya Colony.

The improvement in the postal service owing to the construction of the railway is demonstrated by the following facts. In 1895 the mail averaged 14 days from Mombasa to
Nairobi (265 miles).

In 1905 there were regular runner services between Nairobi-Dagoretti-Kiambu-Kamiti Fort hall and between Kitui and Machakos.
Nairobi was the head post office and branches were situated at Makindu and other towns. At this time there were 40 post offices
and 32 postal agencies in the Protectorates.

The set is quite common especially mint. The high values were primarily intended for revenue and even if found used are
probably cancelled by favour. Who in their right mind would have stuck a fifty rupee stamp on an envelope in 1921?
