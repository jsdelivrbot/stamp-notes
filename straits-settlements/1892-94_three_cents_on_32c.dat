On March 1, 1894, the postage rate on letters , both local as well as to the Native States, was raised to 3c. per 1/2 oz., so that stamps of this value became necessary. As there was no plate for a 3c. stamp De La Rue printed stamps from the 32c. plate in carmine-rose and surcharged them in black "THRE CENTS" in one line on thick sans-serif capitals with a short, thick bar just below to cancel the original value.

\subsection{Errors}

(a.) Surcharge omitted. This was firts reported in teh \textit{Philatelic Record} of November, 1895 (Vol. XVII, p. 250). It appears that one sheet of these 32c. stamps, printed in carmine-rose, had the surcharge omitted from teh upper left-hand pane so that sixty 32c. had the surcharge omitted. This was overlloked both by De La Rue as well as the examiners of the Crown Agents. 

Only five pairs exist and the one is in the Royal Collection.
