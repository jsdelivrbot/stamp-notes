One of the most interesting of all periods of malaysia was the early letters and handstamps used during the period before postal stamps were introduced. It is a rare and expensive area to collect. I
am idebted to the illustrations here to Spinks who recently auctioned a collection of these rare
covers. I have preserved these images in order to freely make them available to philatelists.

Before the introduction of the India Post Office Act of 1837-1838, the postmarks used in the Straits
Settlements came in various shapes and colours.

__Type 1__

This is the earliest known postmark from 18th October 1806. It is an oval frame measuring 37 mm
in length and 32 mm in height. The postamrk was divided into three compartments by two parallel lines
that were 11 mm apart. The top and middle compartments had the letters {{def:P.O.P.W.I.}} (Post Office Prince of Wales Island), while the bottom compartment was left blank. This postamrk can be found stamped in either black or red ink and was uded from 1805 until 1820.
