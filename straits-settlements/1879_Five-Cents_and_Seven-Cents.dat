\chapter{The Five Cents and Seven-Cents Surcharges of 1879.}


In April 1877, the Straits Settlements joined the Universal Postal Union. As the postal rates dictated by the UPU were substantially different from those current in the Settlement, stamps were surcharged. The first two new values were provided by surcharging the 8c. orange with 'Five Cents' and the 32c. pale red with 'Seven Cents'. The normal stamps are fairly easy to find but there are one or three varieties which are much more difficult. All are quite difficult to find in good condition.

This third variety is given in Gibbons' catalogue and and it has a comma between 'F' nd 'i'. It was first reported in _Le Timbre-Postes_ of April , 1881, page 3. Sir Edward Bacon also mentioned it and Wood's reports a conversation with him that he had inserted it on the strength of a copy he had seen. Woods had a copy, but his own observation\cite{Wood, page 37.} was that this was the spaced 'Fi' variety with a spot of ink between the 'F' and 'i', which under examination did not resemble a comma at all.
