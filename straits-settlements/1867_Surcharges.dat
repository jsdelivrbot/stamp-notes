## First Provisional Issue

The first provisional issue was executed by overprinting five values of the then East Indian 1865 and 1866 stamps ('elephant's head' watermark) with a \textsc{CROWN} and the new values surcharged in Cents.

The first provisional issue consisted of nine denominations; 
namely, 1 1/2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 & 32 Cents, and was classified as 
S.G. No. 1 to S.G. No. 9 in the Stanley Gibbons British Commonwealth Catalogue. 
(The details of the birth of this issue was well documented in Dr. Wood's book 
"Straits Settlement Postage Stamps"). 
The first provisional issue was rather short-lived, as it was replaced 
in December the same year by a permanent definitive issue of nine values, 
some of which appeared a little later in 1868, with the last (a 30-cent stamp) in December 1872. 
This article, however, made an attempt to elaborate on the beauty and scarcity of the first 
provisional issue, as well as the types of cancellations used during that short period.

This issue is generally scarce in fine condition, particularly 
in strips and blocks which are considered rare. 


\subsection{Onehalf Cents}

__1 1/2 Cents__ - This value is common in single mint condition and a good used copy with cancellation is not easy to find. It is much more difficult to find it used on cover as there was very little use for this value. 
There are only two covers known that are affixed with the 1 1/2-cent stamps.

\subsection{Two cents}
__2 Cents__ - Although this value does not carry a high catalogue value, it is difficult to find it used on cover. I n the three major Straits Settlements Collections mentioned previously, there is no cover found with this value. This value was used mainly on letters within the Colony, and a considerable quantity must have been consumed. But it was also true that because 
of the high humidity, most of these covers deteriorated and were destroyed.

\subsection{Three cents}

__3 Cents__ - Figure 3. illustrates on entire letter from Penang addressed to Calcutta, India, bearing a 3-cent stamp and struck with the Penang 147 diamond of ten cancellation dated October 2, 1867. The diamond of ten duplex cancellation was the last cancellation used during the Indian Administration.
Penang "147 Diamond of Ten" Duplex Cancellation
The Penang 147 duplex was first recorded on July 23, 1863 and the latest specimen seen was dated October 24, 1867 (as illustrated in Fig. 6). Singapore was also allotted one with the '172' 
numeral, but very few covers survived (N.B: I know of only 2 such covers.)

\subsection{Six Cents}

__6 Cents__ - This stamp is rated as the second most expensive of this Issue in the Catalogue. It is rare either in an unused or used condition, and blocks, in particular are very scare. Figure 4 is an example of the 6-cent stamps used on cover (from Penang to Zoerlohm, Austria). 
This is the second cover I have ever seen with a 6-cent stamp.

\section{Twelve Cents}

__12 Cents__ - This value is catalogued as the most expensive stamp in the series, both in mint and used conditions. An example of this value used on cover is shown in Figure 6, from Penang to Colombo, Ceylon. There is only one mint block (of four) known in existence and it is in the Royal Collection. Figure 7 shows a variety of the 12-cent stamp, with overprint and surcharge double. This might be of proof status, where it was raised from the 'printers waste' to 'a variety' status 
in the Stanley Gibbons Catalogue. It has, so far, been found only in the unused condition.

\subsection{24 Cents}
24 Cents This is a fairly common stamp except in blocks. 
Figure 8 shows an example of this value used on cover, from Penang to Bucks, England.


\subsection{32 Cents}

This was the last value in the series. This stamp is not uncommon as 64,000 were issued. Both blocks as well as covers are known with this value.

These provisional probably used early 1869 were used to alleviate a shortage of the 
2-cent postage stamps. They are ususally associated with the Penang D17 duplex cancellation. They can be found with blue colour and they are considered to be used in Penang. Two types are identified.
