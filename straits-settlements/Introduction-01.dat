\chapter{Straits Settlements}

The {{wi: Straits Settlements}} of the Malayan Peninsula have a distinct postal history from the other Malayan areas.

\section{Background}

The name of the Straits Settlements was derived from the first European settlements in the area of the 'Straits of Malacca'. The Straits Settlements consisted of the four individual settlements of Malacca, Dinding, Penang (also known as Prince of Wales Island), [Singapore](../singapore/introduction) (with Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands). The island of Labuan, off the coast of Borneo, was also incorporated into the colony with effect from 1 January 1907, becoming a separate settlement within it in 1912. With the exception of [Singapore](../singapore/introduction), [Christmas Island](../christmas-island/introduction), and the [Cocos Islands](../cocos-islands/introduction), these territories now form part of [Malaysia](../malaysia/introduction).


Prior to 1826 each of the Settlements was independent and formed part of the East India Company's trading empire.

Malacca was the earliest of these Settlements having been occupied by the Portuguese in 1511. However, the Dutch 
drove out the Portuguese in 1641 after a siege which lasted over five months and cost over 1,000 Dutch lives. 

After the start of the Napoleonic Wars it was taken over by the British who held it
until, by the Convention of London in 1814, it was returned to the Dutch, although they did not actually
take over until 1818. The Treaty of London in 1824 ceded Malacca back to the British and at the same
time His Netherlands Majesty undertook never to form any establishment in Malaya.

In 1785 Penang was an almost uninhabited island and Captain Light negotiated a lease with the
Sultan of Kedah on behalf of the East India Company. Thus Penang became the first British settlement
in the area. The agreement made with the Sultan included military protection. When the British Government
learned of this they vetoed it with the result that the Sultan tried to retake the island by force in
1788. Light repulsed these attacks and a treaty of 1791 included a guarantee of $6,000 per annum. In
1800 this sum was raised to $10,000 per annum for the addition of a strip of land on the mainland opposite
the island (since named Province Wellesley), which gave the British complete control over the harbour.

In 1813 Stamford Raffles, during his Lieutenant-Governorship of Java, visited Lord Hastings in
Calcutta. He persuaded Hastings that the company needed to search for a more suitable harbour and
site for a trading station in the Riau or Johore area. Eventually, Raffles landed at Singapore on 28
January 1819. On 6 February an agreement was signed for British 'factories' to be installed on Singapore
in return for an annual grant of $8,000. On 2 August 1824 the whole island was ceded to Britain.

The short history above is given to help in the understanding of the change in the relative scarcity of
philatelic material from the area during the first half of the nineteenth century. From 1800 to 1820
Malacca gradually lost position to Penang because of the better harbour facilities but from about 1820
onwards the meteoric rise in the importance of Singapore virtually eclipsed Malacca although Penang
still retained some importance. By the late 1820s Singapore was dealing with 75 per cent of the trade and Malacca only 8 per cent.

In 1805 Penang was made a Presidency equal in rank to Madras and Bombay. In 1830 it was reduced
to a Lieutenant-Governorship. In 1826 the three Settlements were united under the rule of Penang as
seat of Government. In 1836 the seat of Government was transferred to Singapore.
