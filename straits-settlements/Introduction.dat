\chapter{Straits Settlements}

The {{wi: Straits Settlements}} of the Malayan Peninsula have a distinct postal history from the other Malayan areas.

\section{Background}

The name of the Straits Settlements was derived from the first three European settlements in the area of the 'Straits of Malacca'. 

The Straits Settlements consisted of the four individual settlements of Malacca, Dinding, Penang (also known as Prince of Wales Island), Singapore (with Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands). The island of Labuan, off the coast of Borneo, was also incorporated into the colony with effect from 1 January 1907, becoming a separate settlement within it in 1912. With the exception of [Singapore](../singapore/introduction), [Christmas Island](../christmas-island/introduction), and the [Cocos Islands](../cocos-islands/introduction), these territories now form part of [Malaysia](../malaysia/introduction).


Prior to 1826 each of the Settlements was independent and formed part of the East India Company's trading empire.

Malacca was the earliest of these Settlements having been occupied by the Portuguese in 1511. However, the Dutch drove out the Portuguese in 1641 after a siege which lasted over five months and cost over 1,000 Dutch lives. 

After the start of the Napoleonic Wars it was taken over by the British who held it
until, by the Convention of London in 1814, it was returned to the Dutch, although they did not actually
take over until 1818. The Treaty of London in 1824 ceded Malacca back to the British and at the same
time His Netherlands Majesty undertook never to form any establishment in Malaya.

In 1785 Penang was an almost uninhabited island and Captain Light negotiated a lease with the
Sultan of Kedah on behalf of the East India Company. Thus Penang became the first British settlement
in the area. The agreement made with the Sultan included military protection. When the British Government
learned of this they vetoed it with the result that the Sultan tried to retake the island by force in
1788. Light repulsed these attacks and a treaty of 1791 included a guarantee of $6,000 per annum. In
1800 this sum was raised to $10,000 per annum for the addition of a strip of land on the mainland opposite
the island (since named Province Wellesley), which gave the British complete control over the harbour.

In 1813 Stamford Raffles, during his Lieutenant-Governorship of Java, visited Lord Hastings in
Calcutta. He persuaded Hastings that the company needed to search for a more suitable harbour and
site for a trading station in the Riau or Johore area. Eventually, Raffles landed at Singapore on 28
January 1819. On 6 February an agreement was signed for British 'factories' to be installed on Singapore
in return for an annual grant of $8,000. On 2 August 1824 the whole island was ceded to Britain.

The short history above is given to help in the understanding of the change in the relative scarcity of
philatelic material from the area during the first half of the nineteenth century. From 1800 to 1820
Malacca gradually lost position to Penang because of the better harbour facilities but from about 1820
onwards the meteoric rise in the importance of Singapore virtually eclipsed Malacca although Penang
still retained some importance. By the late 1820s Singapore was dealing with 75 per cent of the trade and Malacca only 8 per cent.

In 1805 Penang was made a Presidency equal in rank to Madras and Bombay. In 1830 it was reduced
to a Lieutenant-Governorship. In 1826 the three Settlements were united under the rule of Penang as
seat of Government. In 1836 the seat of Government was transferred to Singapore.


\section{Period up to 1836}

\subsection{Malacca}

The earliest letter that has been reported\cite{taylor} from the Straits Settlements is dated 1688 and was written
in Malacca by an official of the East India Company to a friend in Madras. It is a long and detailed
account of the revolution which had taken place earlier in that year in Siam. It includes a description of
the execution of the King of Siam by being ceremoniously trampled to death with sandalwood by
elephants. Presumably the sandalwood sweetened the odour of the operation.
The next item is a letter dated 1780 written in Italian. Unfortunately these two letters have been preserved
as documents and any covering they may have had has long since disappeared.
The earliest entire that I have seen was despatched from the 'Intripid Straits of Malacca' in February
1799 and arrived in London in July of the same year. The short transit time is explained in the letter
where the writer says he is hurrying to finish it, as there is a ship passing bound for England.


An interesting sideline collection of any of the smaller colonies is the incoming mail which is often
more difficult to find than the material addressed to Europe. A most unusual item is a letter from
London to Malacca dated July 1799 which arrived in Malacca in May 1800. It is marked 'Service' in
manuscript and is addressed to a Mr Gillson, Deputy Commissioner of Stores at Malacca from his
sister-in-law. The only postal marking is a large oval 'Post Free - Seringapatam'. Presumably it was
routed this way in an official mail bag as there was still a large part of the Indian Army in Mysore
following the siege of Seringapatam in 1799 at which Tippoo Sahib was finally defeated and killed.
During the period 1818 to 1826 Malacca was held by the Dutch and, consequently, letters from
Malacca to the United Kingdom were charged at the full ship letter rate - hence the letter dated 1821
which was marked 'IJroz' - x 6 rate - being charged 8s. If it had been at the India letter rate it would
have been charged only 4s 4d.


SINGAPORE
P.O.

1830.
Type 4

Up to 1836 there are no postal markings recorded for Malacca. In 1829-30 a large rectangular postmark
of Singapore PO (Type 4) is known. Of the four recorded copies, one is in red and three in black.
Of these three are from Malacca and one is 'origin unknown'. It would seem that this large postmark
was used on incoming mail at Singapore or mail in transit.

The final cover on show from this period was from a little known Fort Lismore which was a military
outpost on the old frontier between Malacca and Naning. It was built after the Naning Wars of 1830
and 1831 which resulted in the State of Naning being annexed by Malacca. The war was started because
Mr Lewis, Superintendent of Lands, wrongly informed the Governor that Naning was part of Malacca
and tithe revenue was being lost. The 1830 expedition was routed by a handful of Malays and a larger
one in 1831 was saved from a similar fate by the intervention of some Malays loyal to the British. The
campaigns were so ineptly carried out that no medals or campaign honours were awarded. The letter was
written in 1836 from the officer in charge of the fort in which he says 'and it is now reduced to an officer and forty men, the country being perfectly quiet.'

\section{Penang}

Although Penang was acquired by the British as a trading post in 1785,1 have seen no philatelic material
earlier than 1802. An entire of this date was sent from Penang in a private packet of letters aboard a
Portuguese ship bound for Lisbon, which is fully explained by the writer of the letter. Upon its arrival
in Portugal it received the Portuguese ship lettter mark and was handed over to the British Postal Agency
who applied the 'Lisbon' and the split rate mark of Port/British 5d/2s 2d making a total of 2s 7d, which
included the Falmouth packet and inland rates. However, it must have gone directly to London where
the charges were assessed as Portugual 5d, packet rate Lisbon to London Is 8d, London to Edinburgh
lOd, making a total of 2s 1 Id. This seemingly was reassessed in Edinburgh to 3s as the rate from London
to Queensferry was actually lid.

Penang is the only one of the three Settlements to have had any postal markings prior to 1830. The
first of these (Type 1) is an oval with three compartments. Of the five recorded copies, two are in black,
and three in red. One of the black ones has 'Free' written in the bottom compartment.


The next cover is one of two recorded copies of the Post Office P.W.I. in three lines in white letters
on a solid red background (Type 2). The two examples are dated December 1820 and February 1821.
In 1826 Penang became the seat of government for the three Settlements and produced a large circular
postmark (Type 3) which is always in red with the words 'Prince of Wales Island Post Office' in white.
The central white area always has the date written on it. This type was in continuous use for the whole of
the period up to 1836. It is a fairly common mark although really fine clear copies are very scarce.
Type 1 Type 2 Type 3

\section{Singapore}

Singapore, having been founded in 1819, soon became the most important of the Settlements, but even so, there is very little correspondence to be found before the mid 1820s. The earliest I can show is dated 1825. By 1836 Singapore was made the seat of government for the three Settlements and by that time letters from Singapore are very much more common than those from Penang or Malacca. It is surprising that up to this time the only recorded postal marking is the large 'Singapore P.O.' (Type 4) which seems to have been used for inward or transit mail only.


\section{Period 1836 to 1854}

a. Malacca

From 1836 onwards mail from Malacca becomes very scarce, and I know of only one postal marking,
other than the ship letter marks which are dealt with later. This is a rectangle (Type 6c) of the 'All India'
type. The sole example is dated 1844.

An interesting cover left Malacca on 1 February 1839, addressed to London. Landed at Marazion,
it received the 'Marazion Ship Letter' (Robertson S2) and was charged 3s Id. On arrival in London the
inspector deleted the 'Ship' with a red handstamp 'India' and reduced the charges to the India letter
rate of Is 4d.

b. Penang

In 1836 Penang introduced a neat little rectangular post mark (Type 5) which was the only one to record
the name Pinang - spelt with an T. It is known in both red and black but it should be noted that all the
examples I have recorded between April 1836 and July 1837 are in red while all those between September
1837 and September 1838 are in black. I have seen eleven examples in red and seven in black.
From about 1840 the 'All India' three-lined rectangular handstamp came into use (Type 6a) which
was a 'Paid' mark. The standard practice was to have the centre line made up of a permanent '18' and the
rest of the date comprised loose plugs for the year, month and day. Examples of these handstamps with
all the date plugs and the end slide are very scarce indeed, as time went on they became undated paid
marks.
It was 1847 before the equivalent 'Bearing' mark appeared (Type 7a). Penang is the only one of the
three Settlements to have used 'Free' marks. There are two types known of which one strike of each has
been recorded (Types 12 and 13). Another handstamp has been seen for 1850 and has the 'Paid' changed
to 'Post Paid'. It was mainly used during the period of 1854 just before and just after the issue of the
60

Indian stamps, namely from December 1853 to May 1855. It was used on letters both with and without
adhesives (Type 9).

c. Singapore

In spite of Singapore being such a very busy place there are only three different postal markings that I
have recorded. The two that are normally seen are the 'All India' rectangular 'Paid' and 'Bearing'
marks (Types 6b and 7b). The former is known from 1840 and the latter from 1846. They are both comparatively
common. The other handstamp of this period is a similar rectangular mark with only Singapore

- Bearing (Type 10). There are two copies recorded both dated 1854.

\section{Period 1854 to 1867}

This is the period during which Indian stamps were used in the Straits Settlements until their transfer to
the Colonial Office in 1867. On 24 August 1854 the Director-General of the Post Office of India gave
notification of the Act which was to come into force on 1 October 1854. This Act stated that all prepaid
letters must have postage labels gummed to them, any shortfall being charged double upon delivery. It
would seem that most places within the control of the Indian Post Office received their  anna and 1
anna stamps, along with a 'diamond of dots' canceller, in time for 1 October. It is also equally certain
that the Straits Settlements did not receive theirs until some time later. The actual dates of issue of the
imperforate stamps of India seem to be mid-November for the 1 anna, early December for the 2 annas,
and mid-December for the 4 annas second printing. I have not yet recorded either a -� anna blue or a 4
annas first printing used with Straits diamond of dots canceller.


The earliest use of stamps that I have seen from the Straits Settlements is on a cover which bears a
pen-cancelled strip of three of the  anna Die I addressed to Calcutta from Singapore dated 22 October
1854. The letter has been charged a further  annas to make up the rate of 3 annas - ie, 2 annas postage
plus 1 anna when sent by private ship. The writer of the letter has just returned from Calcutta and I am
convinced that he brought some of the new stamp labels with him. This would account for both the
pen-cancellation and the understamping, because neither the stamps nor the canceller had arrived in
Singapore on that date.

Another early use of stamps is a cover from Batavia to Hamburg via Singapore. Once again I am sure

that these stamps were carried privately because they are examples of the very scarce first printing
showing the 'dots in the hair'. The first printing took place between 13 and 28 October 1854 and the
'dots in the hair' had disappeared within the first two or three days of printing. These early pulls were all
used up in the principal cities of India where there was a demand for a higher denomination label for use
on mail to Europe. The cover left Batavia in November and passed through Singapore on 1 December,
which would have been sufficient time for the stamps to have been taken out to Batavia. The characteristic
postmark of Batavia which is a circle of fine dots was probably made locally as a sort of replica
of the diamond of dots being used throughout India but which had not yet arrived in Batavia.
The diamond of dots cancellers were replaced by numbered ones, each of the postal circles using their
own numbered series. The Bengal Circle used an octagonal 'spider's web' with 'B' over the number. The
three Straits towns were allocated B/109 - Malacca; B/147 - Penang; and B/172 - Singapore. This
series was introduced in India in October 1855, but I have not seen any cover earlier than 24 April 1856
(Type 16). The diamond of dots canceller was still in use in Singapore in March 1856.

The only combination cover that I have seen from this period is from Switzerland to Manila dated
7 May 1856 (illustrated). The Swiss 1 franc and 5 rappen stamps have prepaid it only as far as Singapore,
where the agents, Rautenberg, Schmidt and Co, added an Indian 4 annas stamp to prepay the letter onwards
to Manila.



The use of the imperforate stamps continued until early in 1858 when they were withdrawn from sale.
In late 1855 the De La Rue definitive issue arrived in India. They were the a, la, 2a, 4a, and 8a on
unwatermarked paper. In 1860 the 8 pies was added. These are all fairly commonly seen on covers from
the Straits Settlements. Late in 1865 the same stamps started to be printed on paper that had an
elephant's head as watermark and because of the mere eighteen months up to the Straits Settlements
becoming a Crown Colony they are very scarce. I have all the recorded values used in Singapore or
Penang except the a blue which I have not seen although it is recorded. The most usually found values
are the 2a and 4a green used in Singapore.

During this period the cancellations of Singapore are generally much commoner than those of
Penang or Malacca but there are exceptions to this, particularly the Indian type duplex (Type 18) of
which only about four covers are recorded, whereas the equivalent Penang cancellation is comparatively
common. Another very scarce Singapore postmark is the rectangular 'Paid' (Type 10) of which I know
of only two copies. There also exists a similar handstamp with bearing of which I know of two copies.
In both cases there are probably more copies lurking unrecognised in collections where the owners
assume they are the common Type 6b or 7b.

\section{Ship Letters - Period up to 1867}

All the three Straits Settlements towns used ship letter markings and there are two distinct types. The
first of these are large squares of 32mm (Types Sla, b, c,). All are 'Bearing' with no 'Paid' marks having
been recorded. They are all very scarce and I have noted six with Penang, nine for Singapore and only
three for Malacca. Two covers were forwarded from Penang to Malacca and show examples of both
ship letter marks. The dates known are 1839 to 1844 for Penang and Singapore and 1844 only for
Malacca, except for a 'stray' example of 1854 for one the Singapore covers.
The second type is a rectangle 32mm x 25mm (Types S3a, b, c, and S4a, b). Singapore is very much
the commonest of the three towns with many copies recorded between 1858 and 1866. Penang is quite
scarce, and in the case of Malacca, I have only seen one example which is a 'Paid' strike dated 4 January
1865. This cover also has an example of the B/109 cancelling the stamp.

\section{Period of the Crown Colony from 1867}

On 1 April 1867 the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony, but not until 1 September was the
payment for postage changed to dollars and cents at the rate of 45 cents for a rupee. All postage rates
that were expressed in rupees were to be altered at an exchange rate of 3 cents per anna. The original
requisition for the printing of a Straits Settlements definitive issue had been placed in January 1864, but
no action seems to have been taken until December 1866 when it turned out to be too late to manufacture
the plates, get designs approved, colours selected, and the stamps printed and transported out to
the Colony by 1 September. In view of this some essays were prepared, with the permission of the
Secretary of State for India, by overprinting the current stamps of India for both postal and revenue use.

Essays have either a crown or the words Straits Settlements on them. Eventually nine values were agreed
using five of the Indian stamps and both overprinting them with a crown and surcharging the new value
in cents over the annas. This provisional set was issued on 1 September 1867 and the Indian stamps were
withdrawn from use. There were a few sets overprinted 'Specimen', one set being on display.

The provisional issue is generally scarce in fine condition, and particularly in mint multiples, except
for the 1 1/2 cent which is seen in large blocks. In the display all the values were shown on cover except the
1-J- and 4 cents which are both scarce. The most commonly seen values are the 8 and 32 cents. There was
very little use for 1 cents value and when Penang ran out of 2 cents they surcharged it in manuscript,
by writing '2' and erasing the Three half with a pen. The 12 cents double may be of proof status.

The definitive issue was finally approved and ordered in April 1867 and the 8, 12, 24, 32, and 96 cents
values appeared in December of that year, followed by the 6 cents in January 1868, the 2 cents in June

in good condition, most of the examples seen having at least one perforation pulled. Also in 1872 the
new 30 cents value appeared to cater for the reduced rate to the UK via Marseilles. This definitive set was
in use until new designs were issued in 1882-83 although between 1879 and 1883 some values were surcharged
locally. During its life there were many changes of rates from 32 cents in 1868 through 30 cents,
28 cents, and 16 cents UPU rate of 1877 to the 10 cents rate introduced in 1880.
On 1 April 1877 the Straits Settlements joined the UPU and henceforth seem to have been in perpetual
trouble with a shortage of stamps of the required denomination. This was partly because of the
fluctuating value of the Mexican silver dollar, and partly because of the UPU policy of reduction of
postal rates. The first of these is the 1879 issue of 'Five Cents' and 'Seven Cents' surcharges on the 8c
and 32c. The five cents was for local use but the seven cents does not seem to have had a use that necessitated
its issue. I have never seen a cover with either of these stamps and used copies are scarce.
In 1880 the UPU rate was reduced to 10 cents but there were no 10 cents stamps available. The 30
cents claret was locally surcharged with a mixed fount of' 1 's and 'O's over the word cents which resulted
in ten different surcharges se-tenant on the pane of 60. A month later a further supply was surcharged
without the word 'cents'. The fount was again a mixed one and resulted in seven different surcharges on
the pane. There are two blocks of twelve of the April issue which show all seven different surcharges.
The March issue with the 'cents' is very much scarcer than the April issue. Also in 1880 the 8 cents was
surcharged '5 Cents' with a mixed fount and a pane of 60 shows the three different '5's se-tenant.
Also in 1880 and in 1881 '10 cents' stamps were produced by surcharging the 6, 12, and 30 cents
values, and the '5 cents' by using the 4 cents rose.

In January 1882 the new 5 cents and 10 cents definitive stamps arrived from the Crown Agents. They
were to be the last of the 'CC watermark paper and the 10 cents in mint condition is one of the scarcest
stamps of the reign. Within a few months the 2, 4, 8, and 10 cents on 'CA' paper were issued. A cover
from Penang to Singapore and return bears both the 2 cents 'CC' and 'CA' which proves that the 'CA'
2 cents had arrived in Singapore before mid-March of 1882.

The period from 1867 to about 1882 covers a large range of rate changes, those to the United Kingdom
including the experimental 38 cents via Brindisi in 1871 and the short lived 28 cents rate of 1876-77.
A cover from Singapore dated June 1874 addressed to West Africa via London bears stamps to the
value of 54 cents being 30 cents to London and 24 cents (8d) from London to West Africa.

In 1883 the new definitives started to appear with the 2c in rose, the 4c in brown, the 5c in blue and the
12c in purple. In the same year De La Rue and the Crown Agents took a close look at the rationalisation
of the colour schemes of the stamps of all the Colonies. In the proposed scheme for the Straits Settlements,
the main point of interest is the examples of the proposed new colours of the 24c, and 32c which
have been perforated 11-8 which seems to be the same machine that produced the Hong Kong 2c of
1882-83 variety perforation 12. This machine was probably a small hand operated one used for small
quantities of proofs or colour trials.

In 1884 further surcharges were made of 4c on 5c blue, and 8c on both colours of the 12c. In all
cases the word 'Cents' is identical but the surcharges were very fine and rather indistinct. In view of this
the 4c was resurcharged with a large '4' and the 8c with a large '8'. Of the former the seven recorded
examples are all used and all came from the correspondence of Mr Isemonger to his family. Mr Isemonger
was Colonial Treasurer in Singapore at the time. The small 8 cents is known in blue but only
when resurcharged with the large '8' and only in mint condition and was probably of proof status.
Between 1885 and 1892 there were five different '3 Cents' surcharges of which two were made in
London by De La Rue. These were on the 32 cents value, that of 1885 being on magenta and that of
1894 on a carmine rose colour which was not issued without surcharge. However this had one pane of
60 stamps without the surcharge and a postal official in Singapore purchased the whole sheet and then
used the top right-hand copy to frank a registered letter to England and sold the rest to Whitfield King
Ltd. On display were the unique cover and one of the five remaining interpane vertical pairs showing
stamps with and without surcharge se-tenant.

In 1892 the Colonial key type stamps were introduced into the Straits Settlements. The $5 was issued
in 1898 and was the first bi-coloured stamp of the Straits. Prior to its issue a series of colour trials were
produced in 1896 (eleven shown).

Mail was originally handled privately by passing ships; the earliest known postal markings date from around 1806, used by a post office on Prince of Wales Island (now Penang). Service was regularized in 1837 by the Indian Post Office Act; postage stamps of India were used from 1854, the Settlements being considered part of the "Bengal circle", then from 1861 part of the "Burma circle". The cancellations used were B109 at Malacca, B147 at Penang, and B172 at Singapore.
1904 8c, used in 1906

When the Settlements became a crown colony in 1867, they began issuing their own stamps, not least because they adopted a currency based on 96 cents to a silver dollar.
1892 25c "key plate"

Beginning on 1 September 1867, nine types in the existing stocks of Indian stamps were overprinted with a crown and a new value in cents. Stamps printed by De La Rue for the Settlements started arriving in December; they are notable for a prominent white frame around the profile of Victoria, inscribed "STRAITS SETTLEMENTS POSTAGE". The set of nine values, 2c to 96c, appeared gradually, with the 30c value not being issued until 1872.

Shortages from 1879 through 1882 forced the production of various surcharges, until new 5c and 10c stamps arrived in January 1882. This was not the end of difficulties, and additional surcharges appear regularly until the end of the century.

In 1892, stamps of the key plate issues went on sale, a number of them printed in two colors. A notable feature of this issue is the $5 stamp issued in 1898.
1918 4c, used in 1921, probably Malacca

\section{King Edward Reign}

The accession of King Edward VII necessitated new stamps in 1902, still in a key plate design, supplemented in 1903 with a design using oval vignette. In 1907, the remainder of the stamps of Labuan were overprinted "STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.", some with new denominations, and in 1910 new large-format stamps appeared with values of $25 and $500 (although available for postage, their usual use was fiscal).
12c, 1938, used at Penang

\section{King George Reign}
George V replaced his father on stamps beginning in 1912, reusing frames and only replacing vignettes. These stamps were overprinted in 1922 to mark the Malaya-Borneo Exhibition. The Settlements also joined in the Silver Jubilee for George V in 1935.
2-dollar value used at Port Swettenham (now Port Klang) in 1949

The last issue of the Settlements was for George VI beginning in 1937.

\section{Japanese Occupation}

In March 1942, Japan issued stamps for their occupation, made by overprinting existing stamps with Japanese inscriptions.

After the Japanese left in 1945, the British military administration issued provisionals by overprinting Straits Settlements stamps with "BMA / MALAYA". These were available everywhere in Malaya, and used until regular postage stamp printing was organized, as late as 1951 in the case of Kelantan.

__The Trotters, father and son, who directed the Straits Settlements Post Office for nearly forty years__. Mr. Henry Trotter went from Ceylon as the first Postmaster-General of the Straits. His son, Mr. Noel Trotter, as P.M.G. from 1883-1895.
 when he was confirmed in that office, which he continued to hold until his retirement in 1907. 
 
From some of the excerpts we have given it will be readily recognised that Mr. Noel Trotter was a most progressive and enlightened Chief of the Department, and it is largely due to his able direction that the Straits Settlements Post Office, functioning in a Colony of unique geographical position and importance, has attained its present advanced state of efficiency.
