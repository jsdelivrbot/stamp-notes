# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of the Straits Settlements

The Strais Settlements of the Malayan Peninsula have a distinct postal history from the other Malayan areas.

\section{Background}

The name of the Straits Settlements was derived from the first European settlements in the area of the 'Straits of Malacca'. The Straits Settlements consisted of the four individual settlements of Malacca, Dinding, Penang (also known as Prince of Wales Island), Singapore (with Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands). The island of Labuan, off the coast of Borneo, was also incorporated into the colony with effect from 1 January 1907, becoming a separate settlement within it in 1912. With the exception of [Singapore](../singapore/introduction), [Christmas Island](../christmas-island/introduction), and the [Cocos Islands](../cocos-islands/introduction), these territories now form part of [Malaysia](../malaysia/introduction).


Prior to 1826 each of the Settlements was independent and formed part of the East India Company's trading empire.

Malacca was the earliest of these Settlements having been occupied by the Portuguese in 1511. However, the Dutch drove out the Portuguese in 1641 after a siege which lasted over five months and cost over 1,000 Dutch lives. 

After the start of the Napoleonic Wars it was taken over by the British who held it
until, by the Convention of London in 1814, it was returned to the Dutch, although they did not actually
take over until 1818. The Treaty of London in 1824 ceded Malacca back to the British and at the same
time His Netherlands Majesty undertook never to form any establishment in Malaya.

In 1785 Penang was an almost uninhabited island and Captain Light negotiated a lease with the
Sultan of Kedah on behalf of the East India Company. Thus Penang became the first British settlement
in the area. The agreement made with the Sultan included military protection. When the British Government
learned of this they vetoed it with the result that the Sultan tried to retake the island by force in
1788. Light repulsed these attacks and a treaty of 1791 included a guarantee of $6,000 per annum. In
1800 this sum was raised to $10,000 per annum for the addition of a strip of land on the mainland opposite
the island (since named Province Wellesley), which gave the British complete control over the harbour.

In 1813 Stamford Raffles, during his Lieutenant-Governorship of Java, visited Lord Hastings in
Calcutta. He persuaded Hastings that the company needed to search for a more suitable harbour and
site for a trading station in the Riau or Johore area. Eventually, Raffles landed at Singapore on 28
January 1819. On 6 February an agreement was signed for British 'factories' to be installed on Singapore
in return for an annual grant of $8,000. On 2 August 1824 the whole island was ceded to Britain.

The short history above is given to help in the understanding of the change in the relative scarcity of
philatelic material from the area during the first half of the nineteenth century. From 1800 to 1820
Malacca gradually lost position to Penang because of the better harbour facilities but from about 1820
onwards the meteoric rise in the importance of Singapore virtually eclipsed Malacca although Penang
still retained some importance. By the late 1820s Singapore was dealing with 75 per cent of the trade and Malacca only 8 per cent.

In 1805 Penang was made a Presidency equal in rank to Madras and Bombay. In 1830 it was reduced
to a Lieutenant-Governorship. In 1826 the three Settlements were united under the rule of Penang as
seat of Government. In 1836 the seat of Government was transferred to Singapore.


\section{Period up to 1836}

\subsection{Malacca}

The earliest letter that has been reported\cite{taylor} from the Straits Settlements is dated 1688 and was written
in Malacca by an official of the East India Company to a friend in Madras. It is a long and detailed
account of the revolution which had taken place earlier in that year in Siam. It includes a description of
the execution of the King of Siam by being ceremoniously trampled to death with sandalwood by
elephants. Presumably the sandalwood sweetened the odour of the operation.
The next item is a letter dated 1780 written in Italian. Unfortunately these two letters have been preserved
as documents and any covering they may have had has long since disappeared.
The earliest entire that I have seen was despatched from the 'Intripid Straits of Malacca' in February
1799 and arrived in London in July of the same year. The short transit time is explained in the letter
where the writer says he is hurrying to finish it, as there is a ship passing bound for England.


An interesting sideline collection of any of the smaller colonies is the incoming mail which is often
more difficult to find than the material addressed to Europe. A most unusual item is a letter from
London to Malacca dated July 1799 which arrived in Malacca in May 1800. It is marked 'Service' in
manuscript and is addressed to a Mr Gillson, Deputy Commissioner of Stores at Malacca from his
sister-in-law. The only postal marking is a large oval 'Post Free - Seringapatam'. Presumably it was
routed this way in an official mail bag as there was still a large part of the Indian Army in Mysore
following the siege of Seringapatam in 1799 at which Tippoo Sahib was finally defeated and killed.
During the period 1818 to 1826 Malacca was held by the Dutch and, consequently, letters from
Malacca to the United Kingdom were charged at the full ship letter rate - hence the letter dated 1821
which was marked 'IJroz' - x 6 rate - being charged 8s. If it had been at the India letter rate it would
have been charged only 4s 4d.

Type 4

Up to 1836 there are no postal markings recorded for Malacca. In 1829-30 a large rectangular postmark
of Singapore PO (Type 4) is known. Of the four recorded copies, one is in red and three in black.
Of these three are from Malacca and one is 'origin unknown'. It would seem that this large postmark
was used on incoming mail at Singapore or mail in transit.

The final cover on show from this period was from a little known Fort Lismore which was a military
outpost on the old frontier between Malacca and Naning. It was built after the Naning Wars of 1830
and 1831 which resulted in the State of Naning being annexed by Malacca. The war was started because
Mr Lewis, Superintendent of Lands, wrongly informed the Governor that Naning was part of Malacca
and tithe revenue was being lost. The 1830 expedition was routed by a handful of Malays and a larger
one in 1831 was saved from a similar fate by the intervention of some Malays loyal to the British. The
campaigns were so ineptly carried out that no medals or campaign honours were awarded. The letter was
written in 1836 from the officer in charge of the fort in which he says 'and it is now reduced to an officer and forty men, the country being perfectly quiet.'

\section{Penang}

Although Penang was acquired by the British as a trading post in 1785,1 have seen no philatelic material
earlier than 1802. An entire of this date was sent from Penang in a private packet of letters aboard a
Portuguese ship bound for Lisbon, which is fully explained by the writer of the letter. Upon its arrival
in Portugal it received the Portuguese ship lettter mark and was handed over to the British Postal Agency
who applied the 'Lisbon' and the split rate mark of Port/British 5d/2s 2d making a total of 2s 7d, which
included the Falmouth packet and inland rates. However, it must have gone directly to London where
the charges were assessed as Portugual 5d, packet rate Lisbon to London Is 8d, London to Edinburgh
lOd, making a total of 2s 1 Id. This seemingly was reassessed in Edinburgh to 3s as the rate from London
to Queensferry was actually lid.

Penang is the only one of the three Settlements to have had any postal markings prior to 1830. The
first of these (Type 1) is an oval with three compartments. Of the five recorded copies, two are in black,
and three in red. One of the black ones has 'Free' written in the bottom compartment.


The next cover is one of two recorded copies of the Post Office P.W.I. in three lines in white letters
on a solid red background (Type 2). The two examples are dated December 1820 and February 1821.
In 1826 Penang became the seat of government for the three Settlements and produced a large circular
postmark (Type 3) which is always in red with the words 'Prince of Wales Island Post Office' in white.
The central white area always has the date written on it. This type was in continuous use for the whole of
the period up to 1836. It is a fairly common mark although really fine clear copies are very scarce.

\section{Singapore}

Singapore, having been founded in 1819, soon became the most important of the Settlements, but even so, there is very little correspondence to be found before the mid 1820s. The earliest I can show is dated 1825. By 1836 Singapore was made the seat of government for the three Settlements and by that time letters from Singapore are very much more common than those from Penang or Malacca. It is surprising that up to this time the only recorded postal marking is the large 'Singapore P.O.' (Type 4) which seems to have been used for inward or transit mail only.


\section{Period 1836 to 1854}

a. Malacca

From 1836 onwards mail from Malacca becomes very scarce, and I know of only one postal marking,
other than the ship letter marks which are dealt with later. This is a rectangle (Type 6c) of the 'All India'
type. The sole example is dated 1844.

An interesting cover left Malacca on 1 February 1839, addressed to London. Landed at Marazion,
it received the 'Marazion Ship Letter' (Robertson S2) and was charged 3s Id. On arrival in London the
inspector deleted the 'Ship' with a red handstamp 'India' and reduced the charges to the India letter
rate of Is 4d.

b. Penang

In 1836 Penang introduced a neat little rectangular post mark (Type 5) which was the only one to record
the name Pinang - spelt with an T. It is known in both red and black but it should be noted that all the
examples I have recorded between April 1836 and July 1837 are in red while all those between September
1837 and September 1838 are in black. I have seen eleven examples in red and seven in black.
From about 1840 the 'All India' three-lined rectangular handstamp came into use (Type 6a) which
was a 'Paid' mark. The standard practice was to have the centre line made up of a permanent '18' and the
rest of the date comprised loose plugs for the year, month and day. Examples of these handstamps with
all the date plugs and the end slide are very scarce indeed, as time went on they became undated paid
marks.
It was 1847 before the equivalent 'Bearing' mark appeared (Type 7a). Penang is the only one of the
three Settlements to have used 'Free' marks. There are two types known of which one strike of each has
been recorded (Types 12 and 13). Another handstamp has been seen for 1850 and has the 'Paid' changed
to 'Post Paid'. It was mainly used during the period of 1854 just before and just after the issue of the
60

Indian stamps, namely from December 1853 to May 1855. It was used on letters both with and without
adhesives (Type 9).

c. Singapore

In spite of Singapore being such a very busy place there are only three different postal markings that I
have recorded. The two that are normally seen are the 'All India' rectangular 'Paid' and 'Bearing'
marks (Types 6b and 7b). The former is known from 1840 and the latter from 1846. They are both comparatively
common. The other handstamp of this period is a similar rectangular mark with only Singapore

Bearing (Type 10). There are two copies recorded both dated 1854.

## Period 1854 to 1867

This is the period during which Indian stamps were used in the Straits Settlements until their transfer to
the Colonial Office in 1867. On 24 August 1854 the Director-General of the Post Office of India gave
notification of the Act which was to come into force on 1 October 1854. This Act stated that all prepaid
letters must have postage labels gummed to them, any shortfall being charged double upon delivery. It
would seem that most places within the control of the Indian Post Office received their  anna and 1
anna stamps, along with a 'diamond of dots' canceller, in time for 1 October. It is also equally certain
that the Straits Settlements did not receive theirs until some time later. The actual dates of issue of the
imperforate stamps of India seem to be mid-November for the 1 anna, early December for the 2 annas,
and mid-December for the 4 annas second printing. I have not yet recorded either a -� anna blue or a 4
annas first printing used with Straits diamond of dots canceller.

The earliest use of stamps that I have seen from the Straits Settlements is on a cover which bears a
pen-cancelled strip of three of the  anna Die I addressed to Calcutta from Singapore dated 22 October
1854. The letter has been charged a further  annas to make up the rate of 3 annas - ie, 2 annas postage
plus 1 anna when sent by private ship. The writer of the letter has just returned from Calcutta and I am
convinced that he brought some of the new stamp labels with him. This would account for both the
pen-cancellation and the understamping, because neither the stamps nor the canceller had arrived in
Singapore on that date.

Another early use of stamps is a cover from Batavia to Hamburg via Singapore. Once again I am sure

that these stamps were carried privately because they are examples of the very scarce first printing
showing the 'dots in the hair'. The first printing took place between 13 and 28 October 1854 and the
'dots in the hair' had disappeared within the first two or three days of printing. These early pulls were all
used up in the principal cities of India where there was a demand for a higher denomination label for use
on mail to Europe. The cover left Batavia in November and passed through Singapore on 1 December,
which would have been sufficient time for the stamps to have been taken out to Batavia. The characteristic
postmark of Batavia which is a circle of fine dots was probably made locally as a sort of replica
of the diamond of dots being used throughout India but which had not yet arrived in Batavia.
The diamond of dots cancellers were replaced by numbered ones, each of the postal circles using their
own numbered series. The Bengal Circle used an octagonal 'spider's web' with 'B' over the number. The
three Straits towns were allocated B/109 - Malacca; B/147 - Penang; and B/172 - Singapore. This
series was introduced in India in October 1855, but I have not seen any cover earlier than 24 April 1856
(Type 16). The diamond of dots canceller was still in use in Singapore in March 1856.

The only combination cover that I have seen from this period is from Switzerland to Manila dated
7 May 1856 (illustrated). The Swiss 1 franc and 5 rappen stamps have prepaid it only as far as Singapore,
where the agents, Rautenberg, Schmidt and Co, added an Indian 4 annas stamp to prepay the letter onwards
to Manila.
