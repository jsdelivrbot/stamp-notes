\section{The 5 and 10 cents stamps of 1882}



Die proofs in black, on both full and stamp size, white, enamelled cards are known of the 5c. and 10c. The full size cards are both stamped "BEFORE HARDENING" and have the following dates: "22 JUL 81" on the 5   cents and "11 JUL 81" on the 10 cents.

The Head of the Queen on both values has only four lines of shading on the lower lip so that it is probable that the same sub-die was used as for the 30c.

\subsection{Specimen Stamps}

These are rare. Although  the Straights Settlements joined the UPU on April 1st, 1877, no specimens of these two stamps appear to have been sent to Berne for distribution.
