\chapter{Singapore Handstamps}

The India Post Office Act of 1837-38 contained some "Rules for Stamping Letters" and these Rules, were applied to the Post Offices in the Straits Settlements. The ones that described the postal marks were listed by Dr. Wood and are detailed with examples as shown in the paragraphs that follow. Wood did not ilustrate all of them which indicate the scarcity of material during this period.

\section{Rule 3}

The stamp for all Service Soldier's and other free letters or packets \textit{is an oval}, one and half inches long by 1 inch wide, bearing the name of the office and the word "Free" and \textit{must be stamped in red}.
