##Introduction to the Postal History of Tristan Da Cunha

{{wi:Tristan da Cunha}} is the largest of the group of three islands discovered in 1506 and named after
its Portuguese discoverer. It lies some 1300 miles south from St.Helena and 1500 km west of Capetown.

It was taken over, with Nightingale and Inaccessible Islands (both uninhabited) by Great Britain in 1816 and a garrison landed
to prevent, as in the case of Ascension, its use as a possible base for an attempt to rescue Napoleon from
St. Helena.

After a year the garrison was withdrawn, but Corporal {{wi:William_Glass}} and family and two other ranks remained.
It has been inhabited ever since. 

In 1885 the islanders lost the greater part of their menfolk due to the upsetting of a boat in the always prevailing swell.
After this tragedy the authorities in Capetown offered to re-settle the remaining population, but the majority
chose to remain rather than adapt themselves to the benefits of modern civilization.
Few tragedies can have had such a devastating effect on any world community than the 1885 Tristan Lifeboat Disaster.

With the loss of regular shipping and trading opportunities, 
virtually all of Tristan's able bodied men (15) decided to attempt to trade with the ship 
West Riding when it sailed off the island on 28 November, despite unfavourable weather. 
Sailing in a newly donated ship's lifeboat, they rowed out of sight eastwards, 
beyond Big Point and were never seen again.

The incident remains a mystery, but the 15 men were missing, presumed drowned 
as their lifeboat probably capsized in rough seas. 
When the ship City of Sparta called on 26 December the population was 92 - 
with 13 widows left by the tragedy, and only four adult men including Peter Green (77) 
and Andrew Hagan (69).

###World War II
During the early part of the Second World war, Tristan da Cunha became HMS Atlantic Isle and a small military detachment
were sent from south Africa to safeguard the meteorological and radio stations which were established.

Letters from the island usually bear a circular handstamp in black, blue purple
or red of various types.

Up to 1940 most covers cannot escape a philatelic flavour, but from 1942 to the end of the war,
if they can be recognised from the Naval Censor marks covers were of a more legitimate category.
