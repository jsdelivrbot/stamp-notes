S.G. #C2, "Tristan Da Cunha/South Atlantic" violet handstamp, 
Cachet II, a nice strike of this handstamp in the very rare clear violet color, 
a franked cover with Great Britain 1 1/2p Red brown tied by both the cachet and 
"London, F.S./Paquebot/12 AP 26" c.d.s. on arrival in London, 
a fresh and clean cover with minor edge tear at top, very fine; 
most covers at this period were sent postage due without franking
because the sender rarely had stamps available to him, this rare violet
 handstamp canceling the stamp is highly unusual and very rare. (Image) 	Est. $1,500-2,000

SOLD for $950.00
