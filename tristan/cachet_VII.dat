S.G. #C9, tristan da Cunha Ty. VII cachet, two strikes tying Great Britain Edward VII 1/2d and Edward VIII 1 1/2d to American WWII patriotic cover to Beira, Portuguese East Africa, South African censor labels and "Correio/Beira/11 Mar, 1942" arrival postmark, opened on three sides for display, Very Fine and rare; during World War II there was little mail from tristan as its function as a meteorological station was cloaked in secrecy, this cover was possibly sent by an American pausing at the island on an American warship and is one of the few uses of the Ty. VII cachet after 1940. View Image
