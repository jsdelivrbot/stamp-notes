Partridge returned from leave on the Japanese ship S.S. Arizona Maru arriving in Tristan on May 30th, this cover clearly being stamped and cancelled by Partridge while on the ship, this is the only initialed and dated type IV cachet recorded and is the latest known use of this cachet, central vertical file fold ending in small tear at top, a fine and exceedingly rare cover, certainly one of the more unusual frankings found on a Tristan cover.
