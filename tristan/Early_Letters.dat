##Tristan Da Cunha Postal History

Tristan da Cunha was first explored by Portuguese and Dutch in the 17th Century and their accounts are preserved in various archives, this is a most important early description of these rarely visited islands and the earliest artifact relating to Tristan in private hands. The remainder of this long letter includes a fascinating outline of visits to the tiny islands of St. Paul and Amsterdam in the south Indian Ocean, and the voyage past the coasts of Sumatra, Cambodia, Formosa and China, the writer took his ship north of Chusan into the Yellow Sea, to which he says that no European had ever been before.

We endeavored to purchase some sheep, our stock being rather low, but the 'Mangles" having been there before us we could not affect our purchase as Mr. Glass (formerly a private in the Army) & the boats crew were drunk. There are four or five families settled on this island & the above mentioned Mr. Glass, a drunken beggar who cannot write his name, is considered 'Governor'; various file folds and opened out for display; outstanding content from one of the remotest places on earth at that time.
