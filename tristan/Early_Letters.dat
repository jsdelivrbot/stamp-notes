June 26, 1840 folded letter from Sydney, Australia to Surrey, England, being one of the earlier letters having passed through Tristan da Cunha, rimless crowned red oval "Paid Ship Letter/Ju 26/1840/Sydney" addressed to Col. Salsey, red straight line "Ship Letter" and red arrival c.d.s.; the phenomenal three page letter (with partial typewritten transcript) includes such passages as: ...During our voyage we did not touch anywhere but sighted the following places - the Madeira Isles, the Canaries, Trinidad Island, and Tristan D'Acunha where we heaved for two hours and a boat came to us. We endeavored to purchase some sheep, our stock being rather low, but the 'Mangles" having been there before us we could not affect our purchase as Mr. Glass (formerly a private in the Army) & the boats crew were drunk. There are four or five families settled on this island & the above mentioned Mr. Glass, a drunken beggar who cannot write his name, is considered 'Governor'; various file folds and opened out for display; outstanding content from one of the remotest places on earth at that time.
