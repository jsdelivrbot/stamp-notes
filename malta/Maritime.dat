Maritime Mail
1875 (5 Apr.) entire to Constantinople, marked "Per S.S. Albanian", sent unpaid by private ship, showing despatch c.d.s. and "4d" in circle, and bearing extremely rare "Via brindisi" perforated green steamer label with manuscript "Albanian" inserted and with red British PO Constantinople arrival datestamp (13.4) on reverse; the entire with light horizontal filing crease, the label with some minor creases and two small tears at left. Only two examples of this label on cover have been recorded, this being much the finer. Photo 
Note: The label was issued by Delfosse et Cie Paris, and is believed to have been used to indicate the route for mail sorted on board ship, one label being put on the top cover of a bundle.
