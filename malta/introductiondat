UNIQUE(?) RED USAGE OF THE MALTA BOXED "5D." MARK WITH "Postage paid" ALONGSIDE; c.Dec. 1939 env. (some overall wear but still attractive) to Liverpool "By Italian Air Mail" with blue Air Mail label with red "PASSED BY CENSOR" on the front as well as a very fine red boxed "5D." Malta mark (usually used on unpaid mail as a Postage Due mark, but pressed into service for these cash-paid Air Mails for the first few days) slightly overlapped by a matching v. fine "Postage Paid" mark (both slightly affected by minor wear). Exhibition item; believed to be the only recorded example of the boxed Malta "5D" mark used for a prepaid wartime Air Mail cover. PHOTO.  	Â£300
