### 1966 Christmas
Malta issued a set of stamps to mark Christmas celebrations. As is n often occurence stamps with missing gold inscriptions escaped the Printer's quality control and can be found with the colour missing. See Figure 1 below.

The stamps can be found with the gold inscription omitted and although rare it is priced reasonably.
