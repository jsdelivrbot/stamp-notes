\chapter{Stellaland}
The first Government of Stellaland was formed by free-booters from the Transvaal on January 10th 1883. The capital was Vryburg (Vrijburg) which, was not
however, was not declared a municipality until 1896. The earliest known date of use of the postage stamps is April 4th 1884.See Mathews p.89. 


This was reported in the \textit{Philatelic Record} p.92, of the same year in somewhat uncomplimentary terms:

\begin{quotation}
Stellaland.--- We have seen a letter from the Postmaster-General
of the Transvaal, in which reference is made to these stamps, which we presume must now be accepted as genuine. 

A correspondent sends us an extract from a letter written from
the Transvaal, in which the following uncomplimentary reference
is made to the citizens of this budding Republic : 

"A new Republic
has been started by a number of escaped
convicts, freebooters, and blacklegs in a country called Stellaland; capital, Vryburg.

It is on the north-west border of Transvaal. In a few months there will be no Stellaland, and the stamps will be too rare to get any- where. Only a limited number were struck
off, and the type is broken." Our correspondent says that the issue consisted of four values onlyÃ¢ 1d., 4d., 6d., and 1s. Now as we know of the existence of a 3d., and have heard of a 10d., and our correspondent gives us no particulars of the 6d. and Is., we
cannot place much faith in his information.
\end{quotation}


Stamps were only valid within the Republic. External mail travelled either via Christiana (in the Transvaal), or 
via Barkly West (in the Cape of Good Hope) and was therefore franked with stamps of both countries.

The stamps were produced in Cape Town by Van Der Sandt, De Villiers, presumably using locally made inks and paper, 
so the colours tend to fade and the stamps often look a bit 'tired'. 
In particular, the blue of the 4d often fades to a bluish-grey. 

The stamps depict the coat of arms of Stellaland. The korhaan represents the chief Massouw, the star the comet after which Stellaland was named, the scales justice, and the impaled fish the defeated chief Mankaroane. The motto below Gewapend en regtvaardig means 'Armed and justified'.

The revenue stamps show the arms supported by two lions. 



Genuine cancellations are always in manuscript. 
When the stamps were withdrawn, the remaining stocks were sold and significant numbers

Imperforate pairs and blocks are known but these are probably printers remainders.
All stamps
were withdrawn on December 2nd 1885.

All cancellations are by pen. It is possible to find these stamps cancelled in
transit after 7th February 1885 at Kimberley used on letters 
posted by members of warren's force and cancelled in transit.




### The Twee stamp
At some time in 1885, some copies of the 4d blue were overstamped with the word Twee ('twee' means 'two' in Dutch). 
The overprint was made sideways with a handstamp, using violet ink, and in a gothic font.

appearance; despite the small thin, this particular copy, with its outstanding

of this rarity extant; signed A. Brun, Calves and accompanied by a
1989 RPS certificate (Scott #6; $3,500.00).

The status of this stamp is unclear. Stanley Gibbons accord it genuine status, but Robson Lowe and 
others consider it a forgery. Having seen three of these stamps, I tend to agree with the bogus status - 
all were mint copies, 
and there is no evidence in the written records of the time for any requirement for a 2d value.
Robson Lowe considered that the 'twee' stamp in all probability was a bogus. Given the concerns of people like Robson Lowe, I am unsure as to how the RPS could have issued a certificate for this. Covers exist with the "twee stamp" and these are shown on the [stellaland covers](../stellaland/covers) page, they don't bear any postmarks and there usage is puzzling. 

In an interesting correspondence between Jongers and Dr Alan R. Drystall in the \textit{London Philatelist} title Stellaland Revisited.


\begin{letter}
Dr Alan R. Drysdall, FRPSL, writes from Southampton:


I refer to the announcement by the Expert Committee concerning the Stellaland 'Twee' provisional (SG6) in the May issue of
The London Philatelist (Vol 102, No 1204, pi 14) and Dr Jonker's letter concerning this announcement in the July/August
issue (Vol 102, No 1206/7, p206-7).

It was, of course, the Expert Committee which concluded that, "the 'Twee' provisional was never used during the period that the State of Stellaland existed". What I tried to demonstrate was the possibility that Cape postage rates applied in Stellaland from June 1885 - or maybe even earlier - and that from this date Stellaland and Cape stamps could be used indiscriminately. If this was the case, there would have been no need for a provisional Stellaland stamp.

If this hypothesis - and it was never intended to be more than that - should prove to be correct, the Stellaland stamps affixed to the four known covers posted between July and October 1885, all of which were also franked with Cape stamps to receipt payment in full of the appropriate Cape rate, were affixed for philatelic rather than postal purposes - unless of course there was a change in the regulations sometime between June 1885 and December of that year when the first Bechuanaland stamps were placed on sale. It would seem significant that, with one exception, none of the Stellaland stamps on these later
covers are cancelled. The exception is pen-cancelled with a simple line rather than with a date and/or initials, which had been the practice. Moreover, although all but one of the four covers are franked in such a manner as to imply that the Stellaland inland rate was 2d per half ounce, one which is addressed to the Cape is franked with a Stellaland 4d stamp in combination with a Cape 2d (the Cape half-ounce inland letter rate).

It is important to bear in mind that, even if the known covers are philatelic, this does not prove that the Twee' provisional was not an official issue.

In the June 1993 issue of The Runner Post, the journal of the Bechuanalands and Botswana Society, Dr Karl Seligmann, who has been reviewing documents relating to the history of Stellaland lodged with the South African National Archives in Cape Town, reports a significant discovery in the minutes of the Bestuur (Management Committee/Government) for 1 October 1885. Van Riet, an attorney by profession and a member of the Bestuur, proposed that, 'whereas there are no more penny stamps on hand, sheets of 4d stamps shall by means of an imprint be altered to the value of 2d each'. It may not be coincidence that J.B. van Riet used a handstamp with his name in the same type face as was used for the 'Twee' provisional, and that a Miss J. van Riet was at one time Zegelmeester (Distributor of Stamps).

Dr Seligmann continues, 'On 29 May 1885, the Bestuur recommended that the Cape Colonial rate of postage be adopted for Stellaland in consequence whereby letters intended for the Colony would have to be stamped with the same amount of Stellaland stamps as they will require in Colonial stamps'.

It is particularly frustrating that both quotations relate to proposals put to the Bestuur rather than to resolutions. There is as yet no documentary evidence that either proposal was adopted. (Dr Seligmann has incidentally changed his opinion regarding the initials 'F H' which cancel some Stellaland stamps, and now attributes these to Ferdinand Hartzenburg, the Resident Magistrate's clerk and Postmaster at Vryburg from at least 1884 until June 1885, when he was succeeded by Eaton.

It can certainly be argued that the balance of the evidence appears to have swung in favour of the Twee' provisional, but this creates further problems. For example, what is the explanation of the franking of the cover addressed to Canada, and why after June 1885 did the Stellaland authorities consistently avoid cancelling their own stamps? Dr Jonkers illustrates an example of the 'Twee' provisional cancelled with the barred-oval canceller coded '555' issued to Vryburg, but this was probably done by favour at a late date as there is no evidence that any of these Cape cancellers were in use in what was
Stellaland before December 1885

##Forgeries

All values were forged, the easiest test being the length of the words of the value (the genuine is the first measurement given).
There is also a slight difference in perforation. 


###Revenues

The Stellaland revenues are quite impressive. They were issued in six values,
one shilling six pence, two shillings, two and a half shillings, five
shillings, ten shillings and five pounds.
