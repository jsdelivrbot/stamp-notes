\chapter{Stellaland}
The first Government of Stellaland was formed by free-booters from the Transvaal on January 10th 1883. the capital was Vryburg (Vrijburg) which, was not
however, was not declared a municipality until 1896. The earliest known date of use of the postage stamps is April 4th 1884.See Mathews p.89. 

This was reported in the \textit{Philatelic Record} p.92, of the same year in somewhat uncomplimentary terms:

\begin{quotation}
Stellaland.--- We have seen a letter from the Postmaster-General
of the Transvaal, in which reference is made to these stamps, which we presume must now be accepted as genuine. 

A correspondent sends us an extract from a letter written from
the Transvaal, in which the following uncomplimentary reference
is made to the citizens of this budding Republic : 

"A new Republic
has been started by a number of escaped
convicts, freebooters, and blacklegs in a country called Stellaland; capital, Vryburg.

It is on the north-west border of Transvaal. In a few months there will be no Stellaland, and the stamps will be too rare to get any- where. Only a limited number were struck
off, and the type is broken." Our correspondent says that the issue consisted of four values onlyÃ¢ 1d., 4d., 6d., and 1s. Now as we know of the existence of a 3d., and have heard of a 10d., and our correspondent gives us no particulars of the 6d. and Is., we
cannot place much faith in his information.
\end{quotation}


Stamps were only valid within the Republic. External mail travelled either via Christiana (in the Transvaal), or 
via Barkly West (in the Cape of Good Hope) and was therefore franked with stamps of both countries.

The stamps were produced in Cape Town by Van Der Sandt, De Villiers, presumably using locally made inks and paper, 
so the colours tend to fade and the stamps often look a bit 'tired'. 
In particular, the blue of the 4d often fades to a bluish-grey. 

The stamps depict the coat of arms of Stellaland. The korhaan represents the chief Massouw, the star the comet after which Stellaland was named, the scales justice, and the impaled fish the defeated chief Mankaroane. The motto below Gewapend en regtvaardig means 'Armed and justified'.

The revenue stamps show the arms supported by two lions. 



Genuine cancellations are always in manuscript. 
When the stamps were withdrawn, the remaining stocks were sold and significant numbers

Imperforate pairs and blocks are known but these are probably printers remainders.
All stamps
were withdrawn on December 2nd 1885.

All cancellations are by pen. It is possible to find these stamps cancelled in
transit after 7th February 1885 at Kimberley used on letters 
posted by members of warren's force and cancelled in transit.




### The Twee stamp
At some time in 1885, some copies of the 4d blue were overstamped with the word Twee ('twee' means 'two' in Dutch). 
The overprint was made sideways with a handstamp, using violet ink, and in a gothic font.

 S.G. #6, 1885 "Twee" surcharge on 4p Grey, incredibly well centered, uncommonly
fresh color, part original gum (this is one of the very few examples of
this stamp we have seen with any original gum), small thin spot, very fine
appearance; despite the small thin, this particular copy, with its outstanding
centering and part original gum, ranks as one of the most desirable examples
of this rarity extant; signed A. Brun, Calves and accompanied by a
1989 RPS certificate (Scott #6; $3,500.00). 
sold 3,500 2,700.00}.

The status of this stamp is unclear. Stanley Gibbons accord it genuine status, but Robson Lowe and 
others consider it a forgery. Having seen three of these stamps, I tend to agree with the bogus status - 
all were mint copies, 
and there is no evidence in the written records of the time for any requirement for a 2d value.
Robson Lowe considered that the 'twee' stamp in all probability was a bogus. Given the concerns of people like Robson Lowe, I am unsure as to how the RPS could have issued a certificate for this. Covers exist with the "twee stamp" and these are shown on the [stellaland covers](../stellaland/covers) page, they don't bear any postmarks and there usage is puzzling. 

##Forgeries

All values were forged, the easiest test being the length of the words of the value (the genuine is the first measurement given).
There is also a slight difference in perforation. 


###Revenues

The Stellaland revenues are quite impressive. They were issued in six values,
one shilling six pence, two shillings, two and a half shillings, five
shillings, ten shillings and five pounds.
