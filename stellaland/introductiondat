## Stellaland
The first Government of {{wi:Stellaland}} was formed by free-booters from the Transvaal on January 10th 1883. the capital was Vryburg (Vrijburg) which, was not
however, was not declared a municipality until 1896. The earliest known date of use of the postage stamps is April 4th 1884. 

Stamps were only valid within the Republic. External mail travelled either via Christiana (in the Transvaal), or 
via {{wi:Barkly_West}} (in the Cape of Good Hope) and was therefore franked with stamps of both countries.

The stamps were produced in Cape Town by Van Der Sandt, De Villiers, presumably using locally made inks and paper, 
so the colours tend to fade and the stamps often look a bit 'tired'. 
In particular, the blue of the 4d often fades to a bluish-grey. 
Genuine cancellations are always in manuscript. 
When the stamps were withdrawn, the remaining stocks were sold and significant numbers

Imperforate pairs and blocks are known but these are probably printers remainders.
All stamps
were withdrawn on December 2nd 1885.

### The Twee stamp
At some time in 1885, some copies of the 4d blue were overstamped with the word Twee ('twee' means 'two' in Dutch). 
The overprint was made sideways with a handstamp, using violet ink, and in a gothic font. 
The status of this stamp is unclear. Stanley Gibbons accord it genuine status, but Robson Lowe and 
others consider it a forgery. Having seen three of these stamps, I tend to agree with the bogus status - 
all were mint copies, 
and there is no evidence in the written records of the time for any requirement for a 2d value.
Robson Lowe considered that the 'twee' stamp in all probability was a bogus.

##Forgeries

All values were forged, the easiest test being the length of the words of the value (the genuine is the first measurement given).
There is also a slight difference in perforation.
