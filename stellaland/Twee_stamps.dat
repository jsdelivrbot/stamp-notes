### The Twee stamp
At some time in 1885, some copies of the 4d blue were overprinted with the word Twee ('twee' means 'two' in Dutch). 
The overprint was made sideways with a handstamp, using violet ink, and in a gothic font. 
The stamp is catalogued by Stanley Gibbons as SG 6 and the same in Scott.

of this rarity extant; signed A. Brun, Calves and accompanied by a

The status of this stamp is unclear. Stanley Gibbons accord it genuine status, but Robson Lowe and 
others consider it a forgery. Having seen three of these stamps, I tend to agree with the bogus status - 
all were mint copies, 
and there is no evidence in the written records of the time for any requirement for a 2d value.
Robson Lowe considered that the 'twee' stamp in all probability was a bogus. Given the concerns of people like Robson Lowe, I am unsure as to how the RPS could have issued a certificate for this. Covers exist with the "twee stamp" and these are shown on the [stellaland covers](../stellaland/covers) page, they don't bear any postmarks and there usage is puzzling. 

After Dr Alan R. Drystall's paper in the \textit{London Philatelist} the RPS Expert Committee announced on 11 March 1993 (page 114) that: 'In view of Dr. A. R. Drysdall's article (The London Philatelist, A Postal History of Stellaland, March 1992, pages 54-66 and April 1992, pages 95-99), which conclududes (pages 95/97) that this provisional was never used during the period that the State of Stellaland existed, Certificates will no longer be issued for this provisional'. Volume 102, No 1204, March 1993.


An interesting correspondence between Jongers and Dr Alan R. Drystall in the \textit{London Philatelist} then ensued.

Dr G.H. Jonkers, FRPSL, writes from Schiedam in June 1993:

EXPERTISATION OF THE STELLALAND 'TWEE' PROVISIONAL (SG6)

May I write in connection with the Expert Committee's announcement (THE LONDON PHILATELIST, May 1993,102:114)? 1 fully
acknowledge the authority of Dr Drysdall, but I am convinced that the decision announced by the Expert Committee is
premature. I am aware that the Stellaland Twee' is a difficult stamp, but this is - in my opinion - no excuse for eliminating it
from expertising. There are more very difficult stamps in the philatelic jungle. There exist, to my knowledge, at least 5 copies
of the Twee' which apparently have gone through the post.
I refer to cover 11 in Drysdall's article in THE LONDON PHILATELIST (March 1992,101:54), and present a copy of cover 10
cancelled Barkly Oc 24 85, backstamped Kimberley Oc 26 and Pretoria Nov 1 (Figure 1 : the illustration comes from H.R.

Holmes' book on Bechuanaland). Furthermore, there are, again to my knowledge, three single copies as illustrated below:

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../stellaland/twee-covers.jpg}
\end{figure}

the Barkly one dated Oc 24 1885 is in the Royal Collection (Figure 2). The two others are in my collection (Figure 3). One bears part of a Barkly cds (certificate 99142); the other has the Vrijburg cancel 555 (certificate 101572). Maybe there are, here and there, in other collections similar copies? The postal history of Stellaland is for the greater part still an unopened book. As long as a careful, complete research has not been carried out, every conclusion can be tempted.

Although we don't know exactly the reason for the manufacture of the Twee', it is at least certain that the items under discussion had been 'used' after British authorities had taken control of the post office in Vrijburg (7-2-1884) and all left the territory then via Barkly West. The Stellaland items were in use until 2 December 1885, when the British Bechuanaland surcharged stamps became available.

My option is that Mr Holmes' opinion on the usage of the 'Twee' in chapter 2 of his book The Postage Stamps of
Bechuanaland is valid as long as it is not contradicted by facts. I call upon the Expert Committee emphatically to undo the
mentioned decision.

\begin{letter}
Dr Alan R. Drysdall, FRPSL, writes from Southampton:


I refer to the announcement by the Expert Committee concerning the Stellaland 'Twee' provisional (SG6) in the May issue of
The London Philatelist (Vol 102, No 1204, pi 14) and Dr Jonker's letter concerning this announcement in the July/August
issue (Vol 102, No 1206/7, p206-7).

It was, of course, the Expert Committee which concluded that, "the 'Twee' provisional was never used during the period that the State of Stellaland existed". What I tried to demonstrate was the possibility that Cape postage rates applied in Stellaland from June 1885 - or maybe even earlier - and that from this date Stellaland and Cape stamps could be used indiscriminately. If this was the case, there would have been no need for a provisional Stellaland stamp.

If this hypothesis - and it was never intended to be more than that - should prove to be correct, the Stellaland stamps affixed to the four known covers posted between July and October 1885, all of which were also franked with Cape stamps to receipt payment in full of the appropriate Cape rate, were affixed for philatelic rather than postal purposes - unless of course there was a change in the regulations sometime between June 1885 and December of that year when the first Bechuanaland stamps were placed on sale. It would seem significant that, with one exception, none of the Stellaland stamps on these later
covers are cancelled. The exception is pen-cancelled with a simple line rather than with a date and/or initials, which had been the practice. Moreover, although all but one of the four covers are franked in such a manner as to imply that the Stellaland inland rate was 2d per half ounce, one which is addressed to the Cape is franked with a Stellaland 4d stamp in combination with a Cape 2d (the Cape half-ounce inland letter rate).

It is important to bear in mind that, even if the known covers are philatelic, this does not prove that the Twee' provisional was not an official issue.

In the June 1993 issue of The Runner Post, the journal of the Bechuanalands and Botswana Society, Dr Karl Seligmann, who has been reviewing documents relating to the history of Stellaland lodged with the South African National Archives in Cape Town, reports a significant discovery in the minutes of the Bestuur (Management Committee/Government) for 1 October 1885. Van Riet, an attorney by profession and a member of the Bestuur, proposed that, 'whereas there are no more penny stamps on hand, sheets of 4d stamps shall by means of an imprint be altered to the value of 2d each'. It may not be coincidence that J.B. van Riet used a handstamp with his name in the same type face as was used for the 'Twee' provisional, and that a Miss J. van Riet was at one time Zegelmeester (Distributor of Stamps).

Dr Seligmann continues, 'On 29 May 1885, the Bestuur recommended that the Cape Colonial rate of postage be adopted for Stellaland in consequence whereby letters intended for the Colony would have to be stamped with the same amount of Stellaland stamps as they will require in Colonial stamps'.

It is particularly frustrating that both quotations relate to proposals put to the Bestuur rather than to resolutions. There is as yet no documentary evidence that either proposal was adopted. (Dr Seligmann has incidentally changed his opinion regarding the initials 'F H' which cancel some Stellaland stamps, and now attributes these to Ferdinand Hartzenburg, the Resident Magistrate's clerk and Postmaster at Vryburg from at least 1884 until June 1885, when he was succeeded by Eaton.

It can certainly be argued that the balance of the evidence appears to have swung in favour of the Twee' provisional, but this creates further problems. For example, what is the explanation of the franking of the cover addressed to Canada, and why after June 1885 did the Stellaland authorities consistently avoid cancelling their own stamps? Dr Jonkers illustrates an example of the 'Twee' provisional cancelled with the barred-oval canceller coded '555' issued to Vryburg, but this was probably done by favour at a late date as there is no evidence that any of these Cape cancellers were in use in what was
Stellaland before December 1885
