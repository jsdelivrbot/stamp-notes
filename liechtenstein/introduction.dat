Stamps of the Principality of Liechtenstein

The first stamps of the Principality of Liechtenstein were issued in 1912. Regular definitive and commemorative stamps have been issued since then and the Liechtenstein royal family has been a popular subject. After World War I and the dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Post Office became independent, but later was associated with Switzerland. The stamp issues of the country were not interrupted by the Second World War.[1]
