The 1950s was a difficult period for Colombia. A military coup in 1953 toppled the right-wing government of Conservative Laureano GÃ³mez and brought General Gustavo Rojas to power. Initially, Rojas enjoyed considerable popular support, due largely to his success in reducing "La Violencia". When he did not restore democratic rule and occasionally engaged in open repression, however, he was overthrown by the military in 1957 with the backing of both political parties, and a provisional government was installed.

Miss Universe 1958 winner Luz Marina Zulaga represented Colombia, a crown that she won by default after the winner Doris Gil Santamaria got married, which was against the Miss Universe rules
