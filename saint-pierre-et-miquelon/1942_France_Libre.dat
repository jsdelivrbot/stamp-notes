\subsection{1942 France Libre Issue}
In 1941 and '42, as a colony under Free French administration, St. Pierre and Miquelon overprinted many of its earlier regular and postage due stamps (as well as a Parcel Post stamp) "France Libre\ldots F.N.F.L." Quite a few of these stamps were issued in quantities of under 100 to under 1,000, and most were quickly purchased by speculators, including the legendary Canadian stamp dealer Kasimir Bileski (1908-2005), whose owner's mark may be found on the back of some of them. The rest of the story was told by Henri Guathier\sidenote{Guathier Henri, The Facts about St. Pierre & Miquelon Free French Overprints, \textit{Canadian Philatelist}, Volume XV, Number 1, Jan-Feb 1964, page 5.} who explained how the sale of these stamps to philatelists helped the islanders to survive the War.  Henri Guathier was the Sales Manager of  The Royal Canadian Philatelic Society was sent to St. Pierre and Miquelon at the time by the Free French...

The Free French took over St-Pierre & Miquelon on Christmas Day, 1941; two days later an order was given by the commander, Admiral Muselier, to overprint in both black and red a certain number of stamps "No\"el 1941, France Libre, F.N.F.L". These stamps were designed primarily as a souvenir issue for the crew of the submarines and ships that landed on the island.
