A survey of the postage stamps and postal history of St. Pierre and Miquelon concerns Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a group of French islands off the coast of [Newfoundland](../newfoundland/introduction) that have issued stamps since 1885.


\subsection{Early mail}

A handstamp is known used from the head post office in Saint-Pierre in 1853.[1] The general colonial issues of France were used from 1859.[1] 

\subsection{Stamps}
In 1885 St. Pierre and Miquelon used overprinted stamps of the French Colonies initially with the abbreviation \textsc{S P M} and later \textsc{ST PIERRE M} on from 1891 to 1892. The first stamp listed by Yvert and Tellier as No.1 was only surcharged on 300 copies. The stamps have only survived with the overprint inverted and in used condition.

\subsection{20th Century}

From 1909 it issued its own stamps with the islands' name printed in French, either St. Pierre & Miquelon or Saint Pierre et Miquelon. 


On July 1, 1976, the islands became an official overseas department of France and the islands used the stamps of France from April 1, 1978 until February 3, 1986 when it once again resumed publishing separate issues.[
