##Fiji

Early works on Fiji Islands, Philately were published by Charles Phillips\cite{phillips:fiji}. Listings of the stamps appeared earlier in A Catalogue for Collectors, by Evans\cite{evans:1882}\cite{evans:1885}. More recent works are those of Roger and Duberal\cite{roger}; Gillis\cite{gillis}\cite{gillis01} revisited some of the studies and extended them to include paper types.\cite{gillis01,eastgate}

For a general discussion on Philately\cite{williams} is the best book. The book is well illustrated and written in a language that is easily understable.\cite{options}
