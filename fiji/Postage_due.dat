The first set of the stamps came into use on January 1st, 1917, and consisted
of the values: Halfpenny, One Penny, Two Pence, Three Pence, and
Four Pence. 

All of these, with the exception of the Two Pence value, were
printed together on the same sheet. The sheet contained ninety-six stamps,
in twelve horizontal rows of eight, and the values were arranged in the
following order: the first three vertical columns were composed of One
Penny stamps, the fourth of Halfpenny, the fifth of Four Pence, and the
remaining three of Three Pence stamps. There were thus 36 of One Penny,
12 of Halfpenny, 12 of Four Pence, and 36 of Three Pence on the sheet.\cite{bacon:dues}

Little breaks in the two border lines, which occur in different places on
stamps occupying different positions in a vertical column, prove the design
was type-set. An examination of unsevered vertical columns of the stamps
shows that each value was set up in twelve types one above the other, and
that in the case of the One Penny and Three Pence these twelve types were
thrice impressed to make up the thirty-six stamps of each of these two
values. The Two Pence was printed by itself in a sheet of ninety-six
stamps, in twelve horizontal rows of eight, from twelve types arranged in a
vertical column, which was impressed eight times on the sheet. The same
twelve types did duty for all the five denominations, the numeral of value
only being changed. The Halfpenny is of the type of the Illustration 1.

In April, 1917, fresh printings were made of the Halfpenny and One
Penny values in separate sheets containing ninety-six stamps each, in twelve
horizontal rows of eight. Like the stamps first issued the sheets were made
up of twelve types for each value, arranged in vertical columns, and these
were impressed eight times to form the sheets. The twelve types used for
the two stamps of the second printing were the same as those set up for the
first stamps, except for the change in the numerals. The Halfpenny of this
printing is easily told as the "1/2" is in smaller figures than those used for the
first issue, while the letter "d" is larger, vide Illustration 2. In the small
number of specimens I have seen of the One Penny, I have been unable to
discover any means by which the stamps of the two printings of this value
can be separated ; without they show a portion of the top or one of the side
margins of the sheet. In this case they can be told as these margins were
perforated in the second printing, whereas they were left imperforate on the
sheets of the first printing. The stamps of the second printing came into
use on April 23rd, 1917.

All these "Postage Due" stamps were printed on thick yellowish white
horizontally laid paper, were perforated 11, and had no gum. They were not
issued for sale to the public, their use being confined to the purpose for which
they were printed. They were withdrawn on July 31st, 1918, and were
replaced by a new set of five values of the same denominations printed by
Messrs. De La Rue and Co., a supply of which had then reached the colony.
All unbroken sheets of the locally printed stamps were destroyed by a Board
of Survey on September 4th 1918.
