\ph[80%]{../Fiji/261662.jpg}{1848 missionary's lengthy entire letter headed "Ono Feejee June 17 1848" & signed "David Hazlewood", to his brother in Suffolk, British 'SHIP-LETTER' h/s, London transit b/s of 13AU13/1849 & 'BURY-ST-EDMUNDS' arrival b/s in blue across the flap, rated "8" for an incoming shipletter, rather decrepit & amateurishly "repaired" with glassine strips. Illustrated by Alford at page 2. He records only six pre-1850 covers from Fiji, of which this is the latest. Ono is a small island in the Kadavu Group, south of Viti Levu. 14 months transit time from the Pacific Islands to England was not unusual in this period. 

Rev David Hazlewood arrived in Fiji by early 1845 & was active there until 1853. He died in Maitland NSW in 1855. His publications include a Fijian/English Dictionary & a Fijian Grammar. In the letter, he states: "There are on all the islands together perhaps three hundred thousand inhabitants. Till within these last few years they were all heathen and savages, killing and eating one another...the enemies they killed they baked and ate, and then cut up their bones into large needles to sew the sails of their canoes with. They go almost naked, wearing only a bandage of a few inches around their loins. This is the case with men and women...Most of the chiefs have several wives and some of the principal chiefs have a score or two. When a chief dies some of his wives are strangled and buried with their husband...when any one is sick long, or old and infirm...they bury him alive [writer's emphasis]. These things I have witnessed with my own eyes...remember dear brother that England was once nearly as bad". See also Lot 668, under New Zealand] [Estimate Price: AUD 1000] }

\ph[80%]{../Fiji/261664.jpg}{1861 unstamped cover to "Revd GH Nobbs/Norfolk Island" & endorsed "Favd by Smith Esqr", two rusty pinholes otherwise remarkably fine for a Nobbs cover, most of which were affected by damp &/or rats' droppings. An exceptional origin/destination item: acquired for $1322 at a Sydney auction in 2005. [With the 6pp letter headed "Mount Vernon/Ovalau/Apl 24th 1861" & signed "CBinner" who states "Colonel and Mrs Smythe...have been detained here for nearly 6 months...Col S was sent out by the British Government to inspect and report on Fiji with reference to the cessions now pending..."] 

The writer was the wife of Revd John Binner, the training master at the Wesleyan Mission in Levuka. He was also a major trader. In 1858, one of his boats was taken by natives at Waea, who killed and ate the crew, one of whom was an American. A force aboard the US ship "Vandalia" attacked Waea, killing 20 natives & wounding a similar number, then burning their fort and town. (Qty 2 items) [Estimate Price: AU$ 1500]
