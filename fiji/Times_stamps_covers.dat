1871 (Sep) cover front to "CW Lomber/US Appraiser's Office/San Francisco" with marvellous franking of Fiji Times Express 1/- SG 9 - characteristically cancelled with manuscript "#" attributed to Levuka - in combination with United States 10c Jefferson Scott #139 (straight-edge at right) which is tied by a segmented cork cancel, 'SAN FRANCISCO/OCT 6/STEAMSHIP...' cds (a word excised from the base) at lower-left & 'SAN FRANCISCO/OCT/6/CAL' cds at top, minor faults still one of the most attractive of the mere handful of Fiji Times Express covers. Marvellous provenance: Ex Seybold (with his handstamp on the reverse), Lagerloef, Purves, Robertson and Mayer. RPSofL Certificate (1987, now lost) stated "genuine as far as one can say". 

The Lomber correspondence was related to mining interests in Australasia. This is the only recorded Fiji Times Express/United States combination franking, making this a highly significant item for US specialists and particularly for collectors of the Banknote Issues.

Offered with a copy of Geoff Kellow's article "The Postal Arrangements for the Fiji Times Express" ("The Australian Philatelist" March 1988), in which he notes that the Fiji Times Express stamps were the first issued in any of the British Pacific territories. He concludes that the Express stamps paid postage only to the first overseas port of call and were accompanied by cash to pay the ongoing postage. This item is Number 8 in Kellow's census of a mere six covers, two fronts, and one large piece (the last lost in the bushfire that destroyed John Gartner's collection). It must be noted that this is one of the best quality items in the census. Most have significant faults and three of them - all illustrated by Kellow - are of "spacefiller" standard only.

Kellow notes that the 1/- rate - common to his items #6 to 9 - is unrecorded but probably represents an increase in the overseas rate from 9d early in 1871. He also notes that subsequent to a Postal Act of December 1871, mail for overseas could be handled only by the Government Post Office. The Fiji Times service was formally suppressed by a notice of 12/1/1872, only 14 months after it was instituted. 

According to Colin Tabeart, this item was carried on the last voyage of the "Wonga Wonga" which departed Sydney 1/9/1871; departed Fiji 11/9/1871; departed Honolulu 25/9/1871; and arrived San Francisco 6/10/1871. The ship was chartered by Hall's Line.
