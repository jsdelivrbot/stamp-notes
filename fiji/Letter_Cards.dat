LETTER CARDS: 1895 1 1/2d Pirogue very late usage in 1905 with KEVII 1/2 d x2 & 3d affixed to pay the 2 1/2d letter rate to Germany + 3d registration & tied by 'LEVUKA' cds, London transit b/s, German TPO 'Vom Auslande/ 1/4 ber Bahnp 10' registration label \& 'WUERZBURG' arrival b/s, opened in the European manner with the margins intact. A most unusual usage. [While this item may appear to be philatelic because there is no message within, paying the letter rate allowed for a letter to be enclosed. The Letter Cards were very unpopular. 20,000 were printed in 1895. However, three-quarters of them were officially destroyed in 1903]
