REGISTRATION ENVELOPES: 1910 De La Rue Size G stampless formular 'REGISTERED LETTER' Envelope to Austria with 'FIJI/OFFICIAL/C.P./PAID' "Frank" h/s at lower-left & a desultory attempt to cross-out the compensation instructions on the reverse, late usage of KEVII 2 1/2 d & 3d tied by 'SUVA FIJI/31/JAN/1913/REGISTERED' cds & boxed registration cachet at right, small piece of the flap missing otherwise superb. An important rarity: this is stated to be the only used example recorded. [Illustrated above Lot 317] Duberal at pages 43-49 records that formular envelopes in sizes F G & K were officially ordered & supplied. However, two errors were made: an impressed stamp should have been applied, and the 'FEE PAID' at lower-left \& the compensation advice on the reverse should have been deleted as they were not relevant in Fiji. On 21/10/1910, the Acting Colonial Postmaster recommended that the 1450 envelopes in stock be used up by Government Departments. This issue should not be confused with the use of similar Size H2 envelopes in the 1920s: see Duberal at pages 58-59.
