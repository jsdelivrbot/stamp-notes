# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Fiji

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Fiji.
Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2,000 km northeast of New Zealand's North Island. It is a former British colony.
 
Early mails

Before the first postage stamps of Fiji, mail was carried by trading vessels to Sydney, Australia, and probably other ports, where it was placed in the mail.[1]

First stamps

The first stamps of Fiji were issued on 1 November 1870 by the local newspaper, the Fiji Times. The British Consul objected to the service and tried to close it in 1871 and appointed an official Postmaster and the Fiji Times service was closed in 1872.
