The Fiji Times is the title of a newspaper that was first started on September
4th, 1869. It was printed, and published every Saturday by Mr. George Littleton
Griffiths, at his Office, Albion-passage, Beach-street, Levuka, Ovalau, Fiji, and
copies were sold at sixpence each.\footnote{See Castle, The Fiji Times Express Stamps} On December 14th, 1869, Mr. John Bagnall
Hobson became associated with Mr. Griffiths. Their partnership was, however,
but of short duration, as it was mutually dissolved at the middle of October, 1870,
when Mr. Griffiths continued the business again on his sole account. The paper
seems to have met with substantial support, as at the end of December, 1870, it
blossomed forth into a twice a week journal, appearing every Wednesday in
addition to Saturday, and its publication so continued for many years.\cite{gillis01}

In the number of the paper for October 15th 1870 an advertisement 
appeared in its columns : —

This advertisement was followed by a leading article in the number for
October 2gth, 1870, a copy of which I now append :—

The postal arrangements in Fiji have been unsatisfactory to all parties concerned. Recent
changes have been from bad to worse. Complaints have become chronic, and dissatisfaction
general. The faculty pronounce our Consular postal system "incurable," and the public generally
endorse the verdict. 

Whatsoever is "incurable," or proved by experience to be bad beyond
is but one opinion, we must have something new, some sound and healthy system that will meet
our circumstances. In the absence of any civilized Government with postal arrangements of its
own, the public mails have hitherto been addressed to the British Consul, who is supposed to act
as Postmaster in his Consular district. 

While a few months ago, this arrangement was not
objected to by the public generally, or by the Consul himself: the increase of population has
made the distributing and despatch of mails a heavy work, which can be no longer done without
remuneration. The public are willing to pay, provided the work is properly done, and the
payment given be not a Consular tax upon a post-paid letter, but remuneration for services
rendered. 

Solicited on every side, we have agreed to open an Express in connection with the
FIJI TIMES, which will give to the public all the advantages of a well-regulated Government
post-office. We have issued stamps, by supplying themselves with which the settlers can forward
their letters throughout the Group, without the difficulty so often experienced of enclosing the
money, and our arrangements are complete for posting letters or papers, and forwarding parcels,
\&c., to any part of the world. 

We despatch mails by every vessel leaving here for the colonies,
and forward parcels, papers, letters, \&c., by all craft leaving Levuka for the other islands of the
Group. Our agents at the different settlements will be known by referring to an advertisement
in another column. Our constituents will instruct their correspondents to address their letters,
&c., "care of the FIJI TIMES Express," and they can rely upon receiving them by the first vessel
leaving Levuka after arrival here. 

Letters need no longer remain in the Consulate till they are
yellow with age or devoured by rats, and the Taviuni settlers have an easy remedy against any
inconvenience caused by the detention of their portion of the mail, of which they so justly
complained in reference to the mails landed from the Duke of Edinburgh. We have gone
to considerable outlay in the enlargement of our premises, and the provision of boat,
mail-bags, \&c., so as to ensure the work being not only done, but well done. We shall
spare no pains to secure a prompt and safe delivery. 

A voucher will be sent with each
mail, and the plan will be similar to that adopted by the Government Post-offices. Combined
with this postal system will be an " Insular Parcels' Delivery Company." We undertake
to transmit parcels to the various districts at which our agents reside. Such an arrangement
has been a felt want. The public are willing to support that which is so
manifestly for their benefit and convenience. " The FIJI TIMES Express" will secure
many of the advantages and comforts of the old country and the Colonies, where the
prompt delivery of letters and papers brings near the distant, and keeps people in communication
with other parts of the world. We shall be no longer put outside the walls
of creation, but in regular and frequent communication with the great centres of civilization
; we shall feel ourselves to be one with the great human family—no longer cut off and
isolated, but with the " FIJI TIMES Express," we can keep up rapid and constant communication
with the most distant members of the great family. All papers, letters, parcels, &c., addressed
" care of FIJI TIMES Express," will meet with prompt delivery.

The advertisement and article prove the " Fiji Times Express" stamps first
came into use on November 1st, 1870, and give the reason and full particulars for
the establishment of this Private Post. It evidently originated through there being
no proper organised postal service in the Fiji Group, and the dissatisfaction that
was expressed on all sides at the then inadequate arrangement.

It will be seen that the statement in the Oceania Catalogue to the effect that the
stamps were used to prepay the postage on the Fiji Times is altogether inaccurate,
and it is a curious fact that none of them were so employed, as the paper was
carried free.

The British Consulate post, to which reference is made in the article, appears
from a letter in the Fiji Times of October 7th, 1871, to have imposed a local fee of
three-pence per letter on all those passing through the post, with the alternative
that a person subscribed two to five guineas per annum, but I believe there was no
regular system for forwarding or distributing letters among the various Islands.

In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the
principal chief,* Cakobau (pronounced Thakombau), as King. A constitution was
agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. A Postal Act was shortly afterwards
passed, and a much improved postal system was thereupon established.

This new postal service inaugurated by the Government, gave the death blow
to the "Fiji Times Express," as will be seen from the following paragraph
extracted from the Fiji Times of December i6th, 1871, and the notice published in
the number for January 13th, 1872.

Kingdom from any other than the Government Post Office. Neither the British Consular
Post Office nor the FIJI TIMES EXPRESS will forward any more mails to any place beyond
the Kingdom. The Government have not yet made arrangements for the inter insular
service, and until they do the FIJI TIMES EXPRESS will forward mails as usual to any part
of the Group."

FIJI TIMES EXPRESS.
NOTICE TO AGENTS.

HAVING received notice from the Fiji Government to discontinue the receipt and despatch
of inter-island correspondence, no letters will in future be received or despatched from this
office; foreign letters, however, arriving at the Consulate Office, will be forwarded in the usual
way until further notice.

The "Fiji Times Express " stamps were printed at the Office of the Fiji Times.
They were type-set, and all the values were printed together, there being as many
varieties as stamps to the sheet. Mr. Castle, in his article, gives it as his opinion
that the five values were arranged on the sheet, each in one horizontal row of six,
beginning with the lowest value. I presume he has taken this arrangement and
the number of stamps to the sheet, from the fact that the imitations he describes
further on in his article are so printed. Be this as it may, it appears from a statement
in the Philatelical Journal for January, 1872, that the stamps on laid batonne
paper were arranged in sheets of twenty-four stamps, composed of four rows of six
stamps each. The top row had six 6d., the second row six is., the third row six id.,
and the bottom row three 3d. and three gd. This arrangement is
further corroborated by an unsevered vertical strip of these stamps
in the "Tapling Collection," as here represented :—

The " Collection " further contains a specimen of the threepence
on the same paper, the lower margin of which shows that this value
came at the bottom of the sheet. Ir

The stamps on quadrille paper, which were first issued, were
probably arranged on the sheet in the same order as those on laid
batonne, with the exception of the bottom row, which no doubt was
composed of threepenny stamps alone. The ninepence on this
paper is not known in any collection, and it was a mistake to have
included it in the Oceania Catalogue. Mons. Moens, who has made
large use of the Society's Publications in the compilation of the
recent new edition of his Catalogue, has noted this mistake, and
he omits this value in his list. It is also omitted in the list given in the number
of the Philatelical Journal I have before mentioned.

I cannot agree with my esteemed friend Mr.' Castle in terming the colour of
the quadrille series "yellowish white." I have not seen his specimens, but those
in the " Tapling Collection " and all others I have examined, are decidedly pale
pink, although the colour of some of the copies appears somewhat faded. I cannot
help thinking that the same sad fate must have overtaken those Mr. Castle
possesses.

Apropos of the set of " reprints " (really imitations) described in the Oceania
Catalogue, it is a curious fact that neither in this work or any other have I seen it
noticed that in the imitations of the sixpence the numeral " 6" is altogether
different. In the originals it measures 6f mm. in height, while in the imitations
it is only 4 mm. I do not know if this is the case with the later imitations that
Mr. Castle described.
