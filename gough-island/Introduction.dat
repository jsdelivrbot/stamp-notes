It was first discovered by the Portuguese in the sixteenth
century and subsequently lost sight until rediscovered by Captain Gough and named after him. 

__The Island was visited by Ernest Shackleton in 1921 who also visited [Tristan da Cunha](../../stamps/tristan/introduction).__

The expedition had been provided by the G.P.O. with a stock of stamps, and a box canceller. Copies of 'used stamps'
(1/2d to 10/- K.G.V.) bearing the date __MY 25/22__ and the boxed cachet __GOUGH ISLAND__ exist.

It was commonly accepted as a British possession, no formal ceremony of annexation took place until March 29th 1938 when a party from
H.M.S. Milford landed and hoisted the Union Jack and declared the island a Dependency of St. Helena.

##South African Weather station
            

The weather station on Gough Island is operated as part of the network of the <a href="/CodeIgniter/Blogs/go/South_African_Weather_Service" title="South African Weather Service">South
African Weather Service</a>. Because <a href="/CodeIgniter/Blogs/go/Cold_front" title="Cold front">cold fronts</a> approach South Africa from the south-west, the Gough station is
particularly important in forecasting winter weather.

The Gough Island teams consist of:

<ul>
<li>a senior <a href="/CodeIgniter/Blogs/go/Meteorologist" title="Meteorologist" class="mw-redirect">meteorologist</a>
</li>
<li>two junior meteorologists
</li>
<li>a radio technician
</li>
<li>a medic
</li>
<li>a diesel mechanic
</li>
<li>biologists (depending on ongoing research projects)
</ul>
