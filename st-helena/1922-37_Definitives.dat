\section{King George V}

The 1912-1916 King George V definitives were similar to the 1903 definitive, the only difference being the King's profile. However this time there were ten values in the set, ranging from \halfd to 3s. Between 1912 and 1913 4d and 6d stamps (not included in the pictorial set) were issued in the form of a key type.

Between 1922 and 1937, a new definitive was issued. It was similar to the 1912-16 pictorials, but instead of the Government House or the Wharf, these stamps showed the badge of St. Helena - a three masted sailing ship near two large rocks. These values ranged from \halfd to \pound1, and there are many varieties, such as the broken mainmast, the torn flag, and the cleft rock.
