# March 1885 Surcharge

According to the London Society's West Indies, the " Halfpenny " on a bisected 1d., and the "FOUR PENCE "on 6d. green, provisionals were issued in March, 1885, the former surcharge being applied at the Post Office, while the latter, like the rest of the St. Christopher surcharges, was made at the printing office of The Advertiser. Of the " Halfpenny" surcharge. Mr. W. J. Gardner, in his paper on "The Stamps of St. Christopher," published in the American. Journal of Philately (1897), wrote : —

" We see it made generally by bisecting the penny stamp from N.W. corner to the S.E., with the surcharge reading downwards, and parallel with the lines of the cut. Cut this way, we meet, rather scarcely, with the surcharge inverted. Our friend Mr. Luff sends a pair bisected in the opposite direction, and the surcharges reading upwards in the same direction. We see also specimens unbisected, with the surcharge applied in the normal direction."
