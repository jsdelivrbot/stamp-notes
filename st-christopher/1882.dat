On May 3, 1882 De La Rue sent the following letter to the Crown Agents as a result of an order for new Halfpenny stamps for St. Christopher:

\begin{letter}
The introduction of 1/2 d Postage Stamp for the island of St. Christopher necessitates the selection of a new colour for that duty, and as it happens the 6d. stamp is printed in green, ehereas according to the regulations of the Postal Convention the \half d. duty should be that colour, the present scheme of colours for the stamps must we think be disturbed. This being so we would suggest a revision of the whole scheme, such as we have shown on teh Appendix hereto. By this means the \half d., 1d., and 2 \half d., stamps would be printed in the colours required by the regulations of the Postal Convention and teh 6d. stamp would be of the same colour as teh English 6d. stamp. The scheme we propose accords with that of the new Barbados Stamps covered by our letter of 24th February last.

PS. We have forgotten to mention that the colour of the new 1d. St. Christopher Post Card has to be decided upon. We would suggest that the card be printed in carmine to accord with the colour we propose for the 1d. stamps.
\end{letter}

The new Halfpenny stamps, with the One Penny, twopence halfpenny and Fourpence in the new colours, were invoiced on May 19th, with the following quantities: Halfpenny, 10,040; One Penny, 19,040; twopence halfpenny, 8,040; Fourpence 1,190.

No charge was made for the duty plate of 20 multiples.
