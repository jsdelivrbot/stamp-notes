\chapter{Saint Christopher}  

Saint Kitts (also known more formally as Saint Christopher Island (Saint-Christophe in French)) is an island in the West Indies. The west side of the island borders the Caribbean Sea, and the eastern coast faces the Atlantic Ocean. Saint Kitts and the neighbouring island of Nevis constitute one country: the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.

The island is one of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles. It is situated about 2,100 km (1,300 mi) southeast of Miami, Florida. The land area of St. Kitts is about 168 km2 (65 sq mi), being approximately 29 km (18 mi) long and on average about 8 km (5.0 mi) across.

Saint Kitts has a population of around 35,000, the majority of whom are mainly of African descent. The primary language is English, with a literacy rate of approximately 98% Residents call themselves Kittitians.

THE Island was discovered by Columbus in 1493. In 1623 the first settlement was made by a party of Englishmen commanded by one CaptainWarner," Suffolk men financed by London merchants," to use the words of a recent writer. At least, it is usually described as the first settlement, because the French expedition headed by Desnambuc, "a gentleman, cadet of the house of Vanderop in Normandy," did not leave Dieppe until 1625. But the Rev. Father Jean Baptiste du Tertre, " of the Order of Preaching Friars and Missionary Apostolic," in his book of 1654 says that on Desnambuc's arrival there were found
" twenty-five or thirty Frenchmen who had taken refuge at divers times and on different occasions, abiding in great peace with the savages"; so it may be that the English were not the first colonists after all. 

Warner and Desnambuc agreed peaceably to share the island, and this division was effected by a treaty between them, dated May 13th, 1629, " for and in the names of the Kings of France and England . . . which divisions the said Sieurs d'Enambuc, duRossey, and Vvaernard [Warner] have promised, sworn and protested on the Holy Gospels." The map of 1654 shows the island divided into three parts, with the English in the centre and the French at the west and east ends. In 1653, " Louis par la grace de Dieu Roy de France et de Navarre " granted St. Christopher and other settlements to the Grand Master and Knights of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. 

War between the two mother countries led to war between the " two nations " at St. Christopher, but it is impossible to compress the history of the various fortunes of the island into a short note, and it will therefore be sufficient to say that in 1666 the English were expelled from the island, which was definitely ceded to Great Britain by the
Treaty of Utrecht, since which time (with the exception of a few months' occupation by the French in 1782) it has remained a British posession.

St. Christopher and Nevis (together with Anguilla and Sombrero) were united in one Presidency in 1882. The governing body is nominated by representatives of the Crown, and is known as the " Local Legislative Council of St. Christopher and Nevis." The ruling official, formerly called the " President," is now officially styled the " Administrator of St. Christopher and Nevis." The area of the island is 68 square miles, and the total population (1901) was 29,782, including 10,000 in Basseterre, the capital.

\section{The "Essays" of 1866}

In April, 1866, both the Stamp Collector's Magazine and the Timbre-
Poste chronicled proofs of a design resembling in its general outlines
the contemporary stamps of St. Lucia, inscribed St. KITTS—POSTAGE,
and some correspondence relating to these proofs was published
in the Philatelic Record of 1903 (p. 190). They were finely engraved
in line, but the statement of the Stamp Collectors' Magazine that they
" evidenced the workmanship of the engraver of the Antigua stamps"
is very wide of the mark. The impressions were in black, dark blue,
bluish-green, and pale brown. In spite of the fact that they were
regarded as authentic essays by Pemberton and also by Moens, who
sold them for many years at half-a-crown apiece, there is little or no
doubt that they emanated from the famous " Boston gang " of the
period.

Notes.
The date of issue of the first id. and 6d. stamps is given as April
1st, 1870, on the authority of Moens, but it would not be surprising to
find that they were put into use immediately on receipt of the consignment
of February 14th of that year.
There is no contemporary record of the change of perforation from
12J to 14, varieties of this description being rarely noted by stamp
chroniclers of those days. Taking into consideration Messrs. Napier &
Bacon's articles on the De La Rue perforation, it seems probable
that the 1875 consignment was the first to be perforated 14, though
possibly the change may not have been made till that of 1877.
According to Alfred Smith & Co.'s Monthly Circular the first consignment
of 2^d. and 4d. stamps reached the Colony on November
18th, 1879. Their issue was rendered necessary by the entrance of
St. Christopher into the Postal Union in that year.

The consignment of May 18th, 1882, included the first supply of
Jd. stamps, and as that value and the 2jd. and 4d. which accompanied
them all had the new Crown CA watermark, it might be presumed
that the id. (lilac-rose) were also watermarked CA . Still this change
does not appear to have been chronicled before September, 1883, and
in view of the rarity of this stamp it is difficult to suppose that both
the 1882 and 1883 consignments were made up of that variety.

The 2\half d. blue was chronicled in March, 1884, and must therefore
be assigned to the supply of January, 1884. The 4d. grey was
chronicled in January, 1885, and is accordingly attributed to the
August, 1884, consignment.

In 1882 (March irth) the rates of postage to the neighbouring West
Indian Islands were reduced to 2jd. per oz. for letters, Jd. per
2 oz. for printed matter, and id. for postcards. As the Jd. stamps
could not have arrived until June, it may be that the use of cut id.
stamps was officially allowed during those months. I have, however,
no definite information on this point, and, at all events, the inhabitants
had to do without their id. postcards till these arrived in June, as will
be seen later on.

The id. in "deep rose," or " carmine-rose," as the catalogues call
it, was chronicled by the Philatelic Record in March, 1884. We have
seen that the 2 1/2 d. blue, chronicled with it, must belong to the 1884,
January, consignment, and therefore the new id. is assigned to the
same date.

According to the London Society's West Indies, the " Halfpenny "
on half id., and the "FOUR PENCE "on 6d. green, provisionals
were issued in March, 1885, the former surcharge being applied at the
Post Office, while the latter, like the rest of the St. Christopher surcharges,
was made at the printing office of The Advertiser.
Of the " Halfpenny" surcharge, Mr. W. J. Gardner, in his paper
on "The Stamps of St. Christopher," published in the American.
Journal of Philately (1897), wrote :
—

\begin{letter}
" We see it made generally by bisecting the penny stamp from
N.W. corner to the S.E., with the surcharge reading downwards,
and parallel with the lines of the cut. Cut this
way, we meet, rather scarcely, with the surcharge inverted.
Our friend Mr. Luff sends a pair bisected in the opposite
direction, and the surcharges reading upwards in the same
direction. We see also specimens unbisected, with the
surcharge applied in the normal direction."
\end{letter}

The same writer suggested that the "FOUR PENCE" provisional
was not really issued at the same time as the " Halfpenny," but at an
earlier date. He gave as a reason that " it hardly seems probable that
such a small supply of the 4d. grey had been sent out as to be exhausted
within half a year. Might not the provisional have been issued in the
latter part of 1884, owing to the total exhaustion of the 4d. blue CA,
and before the grey stamp arrived ? " Our list, however, shows that it
is precisely the improbable that did happen, for the first supply of the
4d. grey consisted of 5,080 stamps only, that is to say, a quantity which
future experience proved to be about a quarter of a year's supply
Judging from catalogue prices, the minor varieties of the FOUR
PENCE, with and without full stop after the " E," appeared with
equal frequency on the sheet.

According to the Society's work, the 1886 provisionals, " ONE
PENNY " on 6d. and "4d." on 6d., were issued in June of that year.
The " 4d." is found with and without period, the latter variety being
the scarcer. It is also found with the period at some distance from the
letter.

The date of " February, 1887," assigned to the is. lilac is probably
incorrect, as the supply was sent out in August of the previous year.
It is said that the first supply was printed in a duller shade than the
second.

In May, 1887,. the " ONE PENNY" on Jd. provisional appeared.
The bar over the original value is ruled with pen and ink, and copies
are known without the bar. A discussion as to the genuineness of
these " no bar " specimens will be found in Mr. Gardner's paper. He
considered them forgeries, but Mr. Luff was of the opposite opinion.
In May, 1888, appeared another " ONE PENNY " provisional,
this time on the 2jd. stamp. There are two varieties, one with small
surcharge (letters 2mm. high), and the other with large surcharge
(letters 3mm. high). Of these Mr. Gardner wrote:—" The first is an
excessively rare stamp, only a single sheet of 20, I think I have read
somewhere, was supposed to have been made."

There appears to have been a lack of Jd. stamps immediately before
the arrival of the November 29th, 1889, supply, and Mr. Gardner
records " an envelope addressed from St. Kitts to New York, dated
' De. 2, '89,' without any stamp, but in place of the stamp, and in the
N.E. corner of the envelope, a circular hand-stamp enclosing the
words 'St. Kitts—Paid.'"

The same writer says :—" In February, 1890, owing to a scarcity of
penny stamps, a small supply of that value was borrowed from
Antigua. Off the original cover, this provisional can be recognized by
the cancelling numerals 'A 12.' I have seen three or four on covers,
and the date stamps on all show its use in the month of February."
The 6d. greenish-grey was sent up in March, 1890, and it will be
seen that only 500 copies were delivered. I am unable to reconcile
this with Mr. Gardner's statement that the remainders included 1,217
of the 6d. greenish-grey. My own impression always was that the
remainders contained only the greenish-grey stamp, and none of the
old green, but that would only make the discrepancy worse. The
most likely solution that occurs to me is that the Leeward Islands
remainders may have included stocks prepared for consignment to the
Islands but never actually sent out.

At the end of 1890, a provisional Jd. on id. was recorded, but
proved to be a bogus production.

According to an official statement in the Society's work, no
Revenue stamps were ever authorized to pay postage, and they have
never been used for that purpose. " Postage and Revenue stamps
[Leeward Islands] combined were issued for sale in the Leeward
Islands on November 1st, 1890, and all the former issues of Postage
and Revenue stamps called in on that date."
