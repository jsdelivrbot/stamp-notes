\chapter{1890 Antigua Provisional}

In February, 1890, owing to a scarcity of penny stamps, a small supply of that value was borrowed from Antigua. Off the original cover, this provisional can be recognized by the cancelling numerals 'A12' I have seen three or four on covers, and the date stamps on all show its use in the month of February and March.
