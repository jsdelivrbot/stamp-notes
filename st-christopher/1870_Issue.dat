Easton does not provide details of the requisition, other than to write that the St. Christopher stamps were another case of an economical price for a small colony. St. Christopher required 12,000 One Penny and 12,000 Sixpence and they had \pound80 to spend. The Crown Agents sent a specimen of the Straights Settlements Four Cents for the Sixpence, and suggested a plate of 20 multiples. For the One Penny, which was wanted for newspaper postage, they suggested an embossed stamp like those supplied for Gambia.

The stamps were typographed by Messrs. De La Rue & Co., wmk. CC., perf. 12½ ; the first two, 1d. and 6d„ were issued on  1st April, 1870, though there is just a possibility that they may have been  put into use immediately on receipt of the consignment on February 14th,  1870. 


I have seen it recorded that the 1d. was employed for the local rate 
and for newspapers, and the 6d. for letters to Great Britain; but I have a 6d. 
used on cover (JY 13 76) from St. Christopher to Barbados, whereas 
another letter to Great Britain bears ten 1d. stamps (DEC 27 1874).

De La Rue put forward the Key and Duty plan, and this time suceeded. St. Christopher spent \pound64.12.0d for a die, a keyplate of 20 units, two duty plates of 20 units and 12,000 of each denomination. The proposal was accepted December 29th, and the die, plates and stamps were invoiced on february 14, 1870. The quantity of each printing was 13,400.

In the 1d. value, where three shades are listed (dull rose, magenta and pale 
magenta) it is the dull rose which is by far the scarcer; it also appears 
(infrequently) with sideways watermark.

The green and yellow-green of the 
6d. I do not consider to be markedly different in shade. In the CC, perf. 14 
stamps (1875-76) again the same two values; the 1d. magenta is known 
bisected diagonally or vertically for use as ½d.; the 6d. is recorded 
imperforate between, in a pair. As the need for a 2½d. rate did not arise 
until after July 1st, 1879 - when St. Christopher joined the U.P.U. - it is 
difficult to understand why the 1d. should have been bisected (in order to 
provide a ½d. value); the first real evidence for a halfpenny stamp was the 
introduction of the ½d dull green in 1882 for a reduced rate for newspapers. 
The Gazette of March 11th, 1882, lists the rates to certain islands as 
follows:- 
 
POST OFFICE NOTICE 
 
'AFTER this date the Postage to the under-mentioned places will be 
reduced to: 
Letters per ½ oz., 2½d. Post Cards, each 1d. 
Newspapers, Printed Papers, Books, etc., per 2 oz., ½d. 
 
Commercial papers same as printed papers, except that the lowest charge 
for each package is 2½d. 
Patterns same as printed papers, except that the lowest charge for each 
packet is 1d

Names of the Places 
Antigua, Dominica, Saint Lucia, Montserrat, Nevis, Tortola, Martinique, 
Guadeloupe, Saint Martin's, Saint Thomas, St.Croix, Crab Island, Porto 
Rico. March 11th, 1882.' 
It is concluded from the above notice that the 1d. postal card was issued on 
or about March 11th, 1882. 
 
As the 1d. stamps could not have arrived much before June 1882, it may 
be that the use of cut 1d. stamps was officially allowed during the period 
from March to June. To return to the 2½d. and 4d. of 1879 (S.G.9 and 10), 
only minor shade variations occur here; the 4d. is known with sideways 
watermark. The change of watermark from Crown CC to Crown CA took 
place in 1882, the perforation remaining 14. The 1d. dull magenta (S.G.I 2) 
is a scarce stamp unused and not common used as this shade had a 
comparatively short life; the 1d. carmine-rose, its more common brother, 
having made its appearance about March 1884. In the carmine-rose there is 
a particularly deep shade; the only major 'variety' is a malformed 'E' in the 
word 'ONE' of the value occurring on the sixth stamp of the sheet of 20; in 
this the right limb of the 'N' of 'ONE' is also slightly thinner. The 1d. 
occurs bisected. Of this series other scarce stamps are the two shades of the 
2½d (pale red-brown and deep red-brown) and the 4d. blue in unused state. 
All the values come either with white or yellowish gum. The ½d. is 
recorded with sideways watermark. The sheets of 20 of this issue (5 x 4) 
each bear the Plate Number in white on a solid circle of colour within a 
circle, with De La Rue's current (reference) number (e.g. 40) in colour in an 
oblong box with indented corners (quite distinct from the Plate Number 
mark). All the ordinary (unsurcharged) stamps were printed from one key 
plate of 20 cliches (four horizontal rows of five), the values being printed, 
from separate plates, in a blank horizontal space at the lower part of the 
design, so that the panes (sheets) of all denominations are of the same size 
with the stamps arranged in exactly the same way."
