The reason for the issue of 1d. cards in 1882 has been given in my
notes on the postage stamps of that date.

Moens records the reply cards as existing with and without accent
over the E of REPONSE.

According to the London Society's West Indies, "in February, 1883,
the supply of the 1 1/2 d. card was exhausted, and the 1d. was issued
temporarily with half a one penny violet-rose, or a halfpenny green
adhesive attached to it, until a fresh consignment of 1 1/2 d. cards was
received from England."
