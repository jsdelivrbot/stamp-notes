\chapter{1886 Provisional}
"THE PROVISIONAL SURCHARGES." A tribute should first be 
paid to those who have done pioneer work by their researches into the 
settings of the surcharges employed for the issues from 1885 to 1888. I 
refer, of course, to Mr. L. J. Gilbert-Lodge, the late Sir Edward D. 
Bacon. K.C.V.O., and the late Mr. Robert Blake Yardley. Their 
writings dealt chiefly with the types of the 'ONE PENNY' surcharge 
which have always formed an attractive feature of the stamps of St. 
Christopher. Unfortunately not much has been contributed on the little 
'Halfpenny' surcharge, the 'FOUR PENCE' (in two lines) or on the '4d.' 
of 1885 and 1886, and for this reason it is not possible to give a 
complete account of these provisionals. It is hoped, however, by the 
combined efforts of those interested, that more up-to-date information 
may be forthcoming for a subsequent issue of the Bulletin. This may 
well be accomplished when material which is known to exist in large 
connected pieces, finds its way on to the market and when it may be 
possible to provide confirmation of the manner in which these 
surcharges were produced and applied. The notes which follow on all 
the surcharges is merely an attempt to summarise known and recorded 
information and to interpolate, whenever possible, my own 
observations. 

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it can be stated that all the 
surcharges were applied in the office of the St. Christopher newspaper 
'The Advertiser,' with the exception of the 'Halfpenny' on the bisected 
1d. carmine-rose; this was applied in the Post Office and was issued in 
April, 1885. This occurs twice on each 1d. stamp diagonally, the 
surcharge either reading downwards or upwards (it is more unusual to 
see the upwards surcharge): the major varieties are the inverted and the 
double surcharge. Accompanying this provisional was the 'FOUR 
PENCE' (in two lines) on 6d. green where two main varieties occur - the 
double surcharge, and the variety with a full point after the word 
'PENCE.' Passing over for the moment in its correct sequence, the small 
'ONE PENNY' (in two lines) surcharge, we come to the '4d.' of June. 
1886. and it is recorded that five types were repeated, vertically, down 
the sheet. The double surcharge also appears in this type and a variety 25 
without a full point after the '4d ': there is also a third variety - with the 
period at some distance from the letter 'd'. 

Now for the 'ONE PENNY' surcharges. In 1917*, the late Mr. R. B. 
Yardley acquired a complete pane of the ½d., surcharged 'ONE 
PENNY', of 1886, and on making a comparison with connected pieces 
and singles of the earlier 6d. green, of 1886, similarly surcharged, he 
arrived at the conclusion that the same setting was employed for both 
provisionals. He stated that the surcharge (presumably type-set, but 
possibly a stereo) was in each case made up of more or less battered 
type, and that the defective letters occurred in the same position in each 
provisional. It will be remembered that all the unsurcharged stamps of 
St. Christopher were printed from one key-plate, of twenty cliches - in 
four horizontal rows of five - the values being printed, from separate 
plates, in a blank horizontal space at the bottom of the stamp design, 
so that all the panes of stamps of all denominations are of the same size. 
Mr. Yardley discovered that the defects which occurred in the 
surcharges were common to both provisionals in the majority of cases. 
The ink employed for the printings of the surcharges on both values was 
thick and cloggy, and this resulted in many instances in the ink 
protruding beyond the outline of the type. 

Ten years later† Mr. E. D. Bacon (afterwards Sir Edward D. Bacon) 
drew attention to varieties of the provisional stamps which he 
considered should be eliminated from the catalogue. The first of these 
was the 'ONE PENNY' on ½d of May, 1887, without a bar across the 
original value, of which he had for long had grave doubts: (this was 
subsequently deleted from Stanley Gibbons' catalogue). Sir Edward 
confirmed Mr. Yardley's statement that the surcharge 'ONE PENNY' 
with a period after the word 'PENNY' was from the same setting as had 
been used for the 'ONE PENNY' on 6d. of June, 1886, but that the 
lettering of the surcharge on that stamp was not quite so worn and 
defective as on the ½d.; notwithstanding this it was easy to plate 
individual specimens by a sheet of 'ONE PENNY' on ½d. Sir Edward 
mentioned that the lettering on specimens of the 'ONE PENNY' on ½d.
