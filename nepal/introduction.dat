First stamps

The first Nepalese were issued in April 1881 as a set of three which were valued at one anna, two annas and four annas. These were initially perforated and printed on European made paper. Within a few months they were released imperforate. In 1886 they were reprinted on hand made Nepalese paper. Numerous printings of these first three values on the local paper were made for postal use until 1907 when new European manufactured stamps picturing the god, Pashupati were issued. The remainders of first three values were brought out of storage and reissued for telegraph use in 1917. Several more telegraph era printings followed. The last of these printings was in 1929.[1]
