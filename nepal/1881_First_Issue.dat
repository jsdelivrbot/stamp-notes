# Nepal's First Stamps

The first issue of Nepalese stamps was in 1881. The stamps were printed on European paper and are known as the "khukuris". The kukri or khukuri (Nepali: खुकुरी khukuri) is a Nepalese knife with an inwardly curved edge, used as both a tool and as a weapon in Nepal and neighbouring countries of South Asia. Traditionally it was, and in many cases still is, the basic utility knife of the Nepalese people. It is a characteristic weapon of the Nepalese Army, the Royal Gurkha Rifles and of all Gurkha regiments throughout the world, so much so that many English-speakers refer to the weapon as a "Gurkha blade" or "Gurkha knife". The kukri often appears in Nepalese heraldry and is used in many traditional rituals such as wedding ceremonies. The "kukri" and "kukkri" spellings are of Western origin, the original Nepalese form being khukuri. The knives are clearly seen on the one Anna stamp, but they are not so easily discernible on the other values.
