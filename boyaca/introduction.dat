Boyacá is a department of Colombia, one of the original nine states of the United States of Colombia.

Postage stamps[edit]

Although Boyacá had the right to issue its own postage stamps, it used the stamps of Colombia until 1899, when it issued a stamp honouring Diego Mendoza Pérez. It issued a few more thereafter,[quantify] the last coming in 1904. The stamps themselves remain commonly available, but authentic uses on covers are rare.
