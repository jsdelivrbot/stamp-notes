\heading{The Only Recorded French-Venezuelan Combination Franking of the First Issue}
\ph[80%]{../french-offices-abroad/259.jpg}{259 1861-62, 1/2r. orange, in an intense brilliant shade, good to very large margins, tied by clean "Correos/La Guaira" cds in blue, used to pay the single rate for the first distance on arrival at La Guaira for 
onward transmission to Caracas, on 14 October 1861 cover from Le Havre to Caracas, paying the 
double French rate to Venezuela on dispatch with 1853-54 20c. blue, type I, and 40c. orange, tied 
by "1495" dotted lozenges, with Le Havre maritime cds and boxed "P.P." in red alongside. A filing 
fold has caused a horizontal tear which is clear of the franking and closed with hinges on reverse. A 
fabulous item bearing the only recorded genuine French-Venezuelan combination franking to 
include the first Venezuelan issue. Of tremendous visual appeal and, without doubt, can be 
ranked as one of the great combination frankings in French postal history. Highly desirable for 
both collectors of French and Venezuelan philately. Cert. Moorhouse, signed Holcombe and Calves. 
Ex Bustamante and Heister. Tito II \euro35'000.

\subsection{1863-1865 Eagle Issue} 


\ph[40%]{../french-offices-abroad/260.jpg}{260  1863-65, 1c. slate, block of four, margins from cut into at top left to large, unused without gum. Usual 
creasing which does not detract. Multiples of this value are of great scarcity, this being the largest 
multiple known, with no other examples recorded in unused condition. Cert. Moorhouse. Scott 
11. Ex Heister. \euro650 Tito II} 




\ph[80%]{../french-offices-abroad/261.jpg}{261 1863-65, 2r. green, 
a remarkably intense shade, full to ample margins which are just touched in places, 
used for onward transmission in Venezuela, on 22 January 1864 cover from Le Havre (France) to Caracas, franked on departure with 1862 40c. orange and 80c. carmine, tied by "1769"  "gross chiffres"
lozenges with matching cds in centre (partly covered by the Venezuela adhesive), used to pay a quadruple rate per each 7,5 gr to Venezuela, with boxed red "P.P." alongside. The Venezuelan adhesive being 
tied by "Correos/Mar 23/La Guaira" cds and paying a quadruple weight letter rate from La Guaira 
to Caracas, within 25 miles in distance. Slightly rust spotted, hardly affecting the franking and of no 
significance for this important item, exhibiting one of only three recorded French-Venezuelan combination frankings on cover in this issue. Cert. Moorhouse, signed Calves. Scott 14. Ex Heister. \euro6500 TitoII
