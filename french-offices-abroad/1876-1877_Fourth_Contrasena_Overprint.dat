large space in the intersection between transfer blocks, cut into slightly in three places, otherwise margins range from clear to huge, tied by "Correos/Puerto Cabello/De Venezuela" double circles which 
were introduced in 1878, on envelope to Caracas. Very slight crease through one adhesive. This is the 
only example known of a gutter multiple of this value on cover. Cert.
