\ph[80%]{../french-offices-abroad/262.jpg}{262 1868, March 5. Envelope (opened for display with upper back flap missing) from Paris to Valencia 
(Venezuela) bearing 1863-70 20c. blue, type II, in strip of four (defective at right) tied by Paris dotted 
star with cds alongside.The cover was paid and carried at single rate to a harbour in Venezuela where 
"1 1/2" reales due handstamp was applied. From Valencia the cover was redirected (very probably the 
new addressee was written on the upper back flap which is missing), and was franked with 1865/70 
1/2r. brown violet in strip of three on reverse, being touched at top, otherwise good margins, tied 
by ink strokes (manuscript cancellation applied at Valencia). Slight soiling not detracting from this 
rarity. Kurt Kimmel expert states in his certificate: "Neither BPP expert Dr. Heister nor myself have 
seen another cover where the postage due rate was handstamped and franked with Venezuelan postage 
stamps". Cert. Kimmel, signed Calves and Goebel. Scott 18. \euro7000 TitoII

\ph[80%]{../french-offices-abroad/268.jpg}{268  1866-69, 1r. vermilion, very large margins, except touched at top right, paying Venezuelan postage, 
on 7 September 1868 cover from Paris to Caracas, franked on dispatch by 1867-80c. rose , pair and 
single, tied by dotted star with matching Paris cds at left, used to pay the triple rate, weighing from 20 
to 30gr., to Venezuela, indicated by the faint "3" red crayon on front and the "3/24" notation on the 
reverse. Embarked from St. Nazaire on the "Floride", with "Ligne-A/Paq." Fr. No. "3" cds on reverse, 
heading to Colon, including Pointe \`a Pitre stopover, where it was transferred to the Ligne G, and registered by the "Ligne-G/25 Sept. 68/Paq. Fr. No1" cds on back, then carried to Fort-de-France and 
subsequently, probably with involvement of the Ligne L, to La Guaira, where the Venezuelan adhesive 
was applied and tied by "Correos/La Guaira" double circle. Some slight tone spots and horizontal 
crease affecting the 1r. denomination.
According to Dr. Knut Heister, although this cover is undoubtedly genuine, there is not conclusive explanation for the use of the Venezuelan franking. As per the usual practice, the recipient had to pay the maritime 
mail fee of 1 Real (regardless of weight), and additionally the postage for the conveyance by land from La 
Guaira to Caracas, the latter also being 1 Real for a cover weighing from 1/2 to 3/4 ounce. The stamp 
would have only covered the maritime 1 Real fee, paid by the forwarding agent in La Guaira, with the 
letter then probably carried by private means to Caracas, which would explain the absence of the usual 
Venezuelan rate marking. Another more likely theory, which was also then in practice, was that the recipient's agent in La Guaira paid the maritime fee in cash and then consigned the cover to the post, applying a 
1 Real stamp as payment for the up to 3/4 ounce rate, which is equivalent to 21.26 gr., thus corresponding 
to the letter weight rate paid by the French franking (20-30gr.).

A fascinating usage on cover which also exhibits a unique combination franking. Cert. Moorhouse, signed Roura (inside) and Calves. Scott 20. Ex Heister.\euro2000 TitoII                                     }   


\ph[80%]{../french-offices-abroad/270.jpg}{270 1873, Jan. 7. Envelope (upper back flap missing) from La Guayra to Bordeaux, bearing Venezuela 
1866-69 1r. vermilion, left margin-sheet copy, just touching in part of upper margin, otherwise excellent margins, in mixed franking with France 1867 30 c. brown pair, 1870 40c. orange, paying the single 
rate up to 15gr. and tied by anchor lozenges with matching "La Guayra" octagonal datestamp (Salles 
fig. 1374), also tying the Venezuelan adhesive. Carried by the "Martinique" from Fort-de-France. 
Small portion of paper loss at bottom left on front, neither affecting the franking nor the markings.
As originating at La Guayra, this cover should not have been franked with a Venezuelan adhesive to reach 
the French consular agency at that city. Nevertheless, this cover is absolutely genuine. The explanation for 
the application of the Venezuelan franking was that the sender, not being familiar with the usual practice 
of mail being carried through a French consular agency located at the place of dispatch, posted the letter 
franked with a Venezuelan stamp believing that internal postage was needed, in a mailbox; the Venezuelan postal authorities considered this stamp as not being necessary as per postal regulations and intentionally omitted to cancel the adhesive. The letter was then consigned to the French consular agency who decided 
to tie the stamp.
A unique franking, of great rarity as exhibiting a Venezuelan-French combination franking on 
mail originating from La Guayra. Cert. Roumet, signed Calves. Scott 20. Ex Heister. \euro 3500 }
