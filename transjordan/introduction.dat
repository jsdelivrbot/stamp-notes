\chapter{Transjordan}

Today Transjordan is known as Jordan.

By the time of Islamic conquest in A.D. 636, Palestine and Jordan, including both settled as well as Bedouin, were almost entirely Christian, but the weakened state of the Byzantine Empire after war with Persia (A.D.585--AD635), changed trade routes away from Jordan, causing economic decline. For a brief period the Fatimid Caliphate ruled Jordan from Cairo.
