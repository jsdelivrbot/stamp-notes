## Bhutan
Bhutan has produced postage stamps for national use since 1962.[1] Burt Todd, who may have been the first American to visit the Kingdom of Bhutan, assisted in establishing a postage stamp program in Bhutan.[2] Bhutan has become known for the unusual designs of its postage stamps which were originally chosen by Burt Todd specifically to attract publicity.

Burt Todd


Burt Kerr Todd, an American businessman, was instrumental in setting up Bhutan's stamp issuing program. He learned of Bhutan while studying at Oxford University, visited the country in 1951, and became an adviser to the Bhutan government and royal family. He has been credited with being the first American to visit Bhutan although that claim cannot be proven for certain. The Bhutan stamp program was set up specifically to raise money for the improvement of Bhutan's infrastructure after the country was refused a loan from the World Bank. Todd set up the Bhutan Stamp Agency in Nassau, Bahamas. He had little grasp of how stamps were marketed through the philatelic trade and therefore relied on unusual designs such as 3D printing to attract publicity. In 1974 the contract was ended in favour of arrangements with the Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation.[3][4][5]

At first ignored by many collectors, some early Todd stamps have become cult items and the unusual materials the stamps were printed on have been copied by other post offices. Canada has issued stamps in 3D and Switzerland has issued one made of wood. In recent years, Bhutanese stamps have tended to be more conventional with just the occasional unusual format. Miniature sheets and highly topical subjects remain the staple of the program, however.


Stamp subjects




Many Bhutanese stamps depict the nation's Dzong architecture and Buddhist heritage and wildlife and sport. The sport stamps are of the Olympics and soccer World Cups. For instance, the Expo 2000 issue in 2000 depicted 6 different dzongs in Bhutan, Trashigang, Lhuentse, Gasa, Punakha, Tashichhodzong and Paro.[6]
Bhutan Post has issued many unique stamp issues. Coin like stamps were issued in 1966, 1968 and finally in 1975.[7]
3D stamp issues were also released, with the first of the issues released in 1967 depicting Astronauts and lunar modules. In 1968 a butterflies 3d stamp issue and in 1969 a fish 3D, a birds 3D and insect 3D stamps issues were released. Other 3D issues are Paintings (1970), Animals (1970), Conquest of Space (1970), Antique automobiles (1971), Mushrooms (1973) and traditional masks (1976).[8]
Unique moulded plastic 3D stamps were released of ancient artifacts in 1971 and of famous people in 1972. Other famous people that have appeared in Bhutan Stamps include Elvis Presley (2003), Princess Diana (1982, 2003), Gandhi (1969, 1972, 1998), John F. Kennedy (1972, 2002), Queen Elizabeth (2002), Mother Teresa (1998) and Albert Einstein (2000).[9]
Ever since 1993, Bhutan has released annual Chinese New Year stamps. Animals and flowers appear often on Bhutanese stamps. Disney stamps have been issued in 1982, 1984 (2 issues), 1985 (2 issues), 1988, 1989 and finally in 1991.
In 2008, Bhutan Post released the first CD-Rom postage stamps in the world.[10] The 2nd CD-Rom stamp issue was issued the following year in 2009.[11]

Revenue stamps




Bhutan has issued revenue stamps in about 1955, 1960 and 1970. The first series consisted of four stamps, as did the second. The third issue was of only one stamp of 10 Chetrum. Detailed information is lacking about these stamps but they are available on the philatelic market and are known used on documents.[12][13]
[edit]Stamp catalogues




A specific stamp catalogue for Bhutan does not exist at the moment. However, information on stamp issues can be found in the Scott, Stanley Gibbons and Michel stamp catalogues.




\ph[60%]{../bhutan/90.jpg}{90		1962	Zoom1962 Unissued Anti-Malaria 33ch Guru Rinpoche sheet in the planned colors. Complete sheet of 50 with plate numbers and Harrison and Sons imprint in selvage. The stamp was never issued as the Kingdom found out that the image was their most revered saint, Guru Rinpoche, who could not be depicted on a stamp which advocated the killing of living beings. The stamp has always been referred to in the philatelic press as the unissued Buddha stamp but this is incorrect. A rare exhibition piece. (Image)	 $ 2,000
