# Stamps and Postal History of the Caroline Islands

The Caroline Islands is an archipelago of 680 islands and islets in the Pacific Ocean between the Marshall and Pelew
Islands. They are divided into two
groups, the Eastern and the Western,
and have a total area of 560 square miles. Most of the islands are only small atolls, but there are about fifty of other formation
and size, the most important being

Area. Population.

Babelthouap, 106 square miles, 10,000
Ponape, 134 square miles, 3,000
Yap, 70 square miles, 3,750
Rule, 80 square miles, 13,000
Kusaie, 45 square miles, 400 The climate, though rainy, is temperate
and healthy. The capital is Ponape on
the island of the same name. Archeologically
the islands are interesting on
account of their cyclopean structures. The people are strongly built, gentle, amiable and intelligent; they are bold
sailors and carry on a brisk trade with
the Ladrones to the north, where they have several settlements. The total population
of the group exceeds 50,000 and
Mr. F. W. Christian in his work on the Caroline Islands describes the people as "a fusion worked out for many centuries
past between trader, explorer, fugitive,
castaway, exile and pirateâ€”streams
of overlapping population following wave on wave."

The islands were discovered by the Portuguese Diego de Rocha in 1537, and
called Sequeira; n 1686 they were annexed
and rechristened with their present name
in honor of Charles II by the Spaniards. Later still they were, for a time, known
as the New Philippines. Several at- tempts (1710, 1731) to Christianise the
inhabitants by the Jesuits from Manila
were unsuccessful. 

\section{German Possession}

In 1885, the hoisting of the German flag on Yap, gave rise to a sharp dispute with Spain, who claimed
older rights to the islands. After much
discussion it was decided that both countries
should submit their claims to the Pope and abide by his decision in the
matter. The Pope, Leo XIII, declared
the islands belonged to Spain, but Germany should be allowed to establish a naval and coaling station there, and that German merchants acquiring land and
residing there should have the same political rights as Spanish subjects. 

On 30th June, 1899, the islands became a German possession Spain having agreed to relinquish her rights in them and also in the Marianne Islands (except [Guam](../guam/Introduction)), and
Palau Islands for a monetary consideration of about five million dollars. Spain
still, however, retained a coaling station on the islands
