## Caroline Islands

### Japanese Occupation 1914

In 1899 in the German-Spanish Treaty (1899), as a consequence of the Spanish-American War of 1898, Spain sold the islands to Germany for 25,000,000 pesetas or respectively 17 million goldmark (nearly 1,000,000 pounds sterling), which administered them as Karolinen, administratively associated with [German New Guinea](../german-new-guinea).

Japan occupied the islands in 1914 and received a League of Nations mandate over them and the Marshall Islands in 1920. During World War II, Japan had a large base at Truk Lagoon, which the Allies effectively neutralized in Operation Hailstone. After the war, the islands (together with the Marshall Islands) became trust territories of the United States, with the Federated States of Micronesia gaining independence in 1986, followed by Palau in 1994.

At the outbreak of World War I, the Australians were expected to occupy the Carolines, Marianas & Marshalls, and had prepared the North West Pacific Islands overprints for use there. However, they were beaten to the punch by the Japanese Navy. Rather than destroy the NWPI overprints, and despite the designation being quite inappropriate, the stamps were issued in New Guinea]
