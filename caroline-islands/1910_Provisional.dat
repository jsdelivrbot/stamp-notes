# The 1910 Provisional 5 pf Surcharge

In 1910, another provisional 5pf stamp
was issued in Ponape. Owing to a temporary
shortage of this denomination
500 of the 3pf stamps were surcharged
"5pf" in black in type similar to that
shown in the accompanying illustration.

The postage stamp can be found used on postal cards of the period and cancelled with the provisional "Typhoon" cachet. These are rare and auction prices vary between 1500-2500 Euros.
