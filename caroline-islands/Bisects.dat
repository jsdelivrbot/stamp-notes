## Caroline Islands

Friedemann at page 773 states that demand from sailors aboard a visiting naval squadron depleted stocks of the 5pf and 10pf value, resulting in the '5pf' on 3pf Provisional Surcharge and the 20pf provisional bisect. At page 775, it is stated that about 500 covers were processed with the 20pf bisect: most were philatelic.
