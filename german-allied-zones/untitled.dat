Allied Occupation

General Issues - 1946


Beginning in February 1946 and continuing through June 1948, Allied occupation stamps were issued for general usage throughout the American, British, and Soviet occupation zones. During this period, the French occupation zone issued their own stamps.

Occupation postage stamps, other than the French zone ones, issued in 1945 or after June 1948, will be found in the Bizone (American and British Zones) or the Soviet Zone sections.

These occupation general issues, in most of the major catalogs, follow right after the last of the Germany - Third Reich catalog listings.
