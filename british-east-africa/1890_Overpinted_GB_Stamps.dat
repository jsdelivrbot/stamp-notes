\chapter{First Issue Covers}

The provisionals forming the first issue utilised three values then current in Great Britain.

These overprinted and surcharged stamps are scarce in blocks, although at least three
unused sets in fours exist. Only three commercial covers are known to me, the most spectacular
of which bears a strip of five of the 1 anna value, and forms the largest recorded
multiple. The now defunct stamp firm of Whitfield King was well stocked with these first
issue stamps and arranged covers for their clients as late as May 1895, but even these
are now no longer common and over a fourteen-year period I have noted six. I show in the
frames the 1/2 anna value cancelled 'Lamu, May 30th 1890'; this is the only recorded example
of a May date on the first issue, and it is probable that these stamps were not available at
Mombasa in time to frank May letters for the monthly mail steamer. The following month's
mail to England was despatched from Mombasa on 24 June, and is the next earliest date
noted on first issue stamps.
