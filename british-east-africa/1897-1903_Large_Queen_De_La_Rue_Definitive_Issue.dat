\section{1897-1903 Large Queen De La Rue Definitive Issue}

The large rupee values appeared late in 1897, with the initial requirement having been
for 10, 20, and 50 rupee duties of standard Revenue size. In order to regularise the size of
all future rupee stamps an amendment to include values from 1 to 5 rupees was placed, and
the complete new range invoiced by De La Rue on 5 October. I show a die proof of the new
issue, also an imperforate 3 rupee plate proof.

It appears an appropriate opportunity to bring to your notice the following relevant
paragraph on page 593 of Easton's De La Rue History: 'The firm supplied a colour scheme
on July 9th, and quoted ten weeks for delivery. One change was made by the Crown Agents;
the colour of the Ten Rupees was altered from dark blue to purple,'
The above value should surely read 50 rupees, since the colour of the 10 rupees is yellowbistre.

To emphasise the point I am able to show a proof in the unacceptable dark blue
colour quoted, the value tablet having been completed with a handpainted 'Fifty Rupees'.
