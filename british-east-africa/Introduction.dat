##British East Africa

Britain had interests in this area as early as 1824. Missionaries are known to 
have settled in the area in 1844. The {{wi: Imperial_British_East_Africa_Company}} obtained 
a concession in 1887 to administer this area, from Sultan Bargash of the Sultanate 
of Zanzibar. The company started to experience financial difficulties in 1891. 
The situation was made more difficult in 1892 when Britain declared the Sultanate 
of Zanzibar part of the Congo Free Trade Zone and thus depriving the company of 
import duties.[1] On 1 July 1895, the British government took over the administration 
of this area when the company was facing bankruptcy.


\section{Pre-stamp era} 

The early missionaries in British East Africa sent letters by runner to forwarding 
agents in Zanzibar. Letters are known from as early as 1848. From 1875 mail 
was sent via the Indian post office which had been opened in Zanzibar.

## Imperial British East Africa Company administration

The Imperial British East Africa Company was the first company holding a Royal Charter allowing operation of a postal system, for both local and international mail, to use their company name on the their stamps. They were also the first to create a series of surcharged stamps with authorizing initials. Both of these led to the adoption of these practices by other countries such as the British South Africa Company and the Mozambique Company in 1892 and the surcharged Uganda typewritten stamps in 1895.[2]

The Imperial British East Africa Company set up post offices at Mombasa and Lamu in May 1890.[3] The first stamps issued, on 23 May 1890, were surcharges on British postage stamps with values of Â½, 1 and 4 annas and 'BRITISH EAST AFRICA COMPANY'.
During an acute shortage of stamps in August and September 1890 stamps of India were used and are known postmarked 'MOMBASA' or 'LAMU'. It is alleged that an agent of stamp dealer Whitfield King bought up all the stocks in the post offices.[4]

The British East Africa Company issued stamps, on 14 October 1890, using a symbolic sun and crown design and inscribed 'IMPERIAL BRITISH EAST AFRICA COMPANY', all valued in annas and rupees.

Shortages, of some values, between 1891 and 1895 resulted in a variety of surcharges being produced.

\section{British administration} 

On 9 July 1895 stamps of Imperial British East Africa Company were overprinted reading 'BRITISH / EAST / AFRICA' and overprints of 'British / East / Africa' on stamps of India were also issued.[3] The protectorate joined the Universal Postal Union at this time.

In 1896 a series of stamps depicting Queen Victoria was issued, inscribed 'BRITISH EAST AFRICA', these ran short in 1897 and stamps of Zanzibar were overprinted as the stamps of India had been previously. 

A number of additional post offices were opened along the Uganda Railway, which was started in 1896 at Mombasa and reached Kisumu on Lake Victoria in 1902.

In 1901 the postal administration was merged with that of Uganda, and in 1904 stamps issued for the combined East Africa and Uganda Protectorates came into use.[3]
