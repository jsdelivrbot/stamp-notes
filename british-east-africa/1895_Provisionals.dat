Throughout 1894 the position of the Imperial British East Africa Company became
increasingly untenable, and the venture had clearly failed to realise the expectations of its founders. At the outset the company received considerable encouragement from the then
Prime Minister - Lord Salisbury - but following Gladstone's victory at the 1892 General
Election the new Liberal Government was unsympathetic. The construction of a cross-

Imperial Administration
On 31 August 1895, the Foreign Office stated that all territories in East Africa which were then under British protection (except the islands of Pemba and Zanzibar, and also the Uganda Protectorate), would be included in one Protectorate under the name British East Africa
1895 Grace Period
There was a "grace period" for use of IBEA Co. stamps and postal stationery after the change in postal administrations on 1 July until the release of Provisionals on 9 July in Mombasa and 10 July in Lamu
1890-95 7½a. dated 6 July, ½a. and 2½a. dated 7 July, 1895 "TECR" ½a. on 3a. dated 9 July and 1890-95 7½a. exceptionally dated out of period on 20 July, all at Mombasa, and 1890 95 2½a. dated 10 July at Lamu. A scarce and most unusual group. Photo

country railway was essential for the successful development of British East Africa and
Uganda, but the company could not raise the necessary funds and the Government would
not, at this time, provide the millions of pounds required to further such a politically
contentious project. The company became progressively insolvent, and terms for its liquidation
were proposed by the British Government in November 1894. Agreement was
reached in March 1895, Protectorate status declared in mid-June, and administrative
control in British East Africa passed to the Crown on 1 July of that year.

The company postmaster at Mombasa - Thomas Remington - gained considerable
promotion from the new regime, being appointed Postmaster-General of both the British
East Africa and Zanzibar Protectorates. Remington's immediate problem was to reflect the
changed status on the stamps, and the small stock of the company issue remaining at
Mombasa on 1 July was handstamped under his supervision. Unused blocks of these
stamps are scarce, and it is significant that blocks of three values only are recorded in the
Royal Collection. I am able to show six values in unused blocks, a notable item being a
corner multiple of eight of the 8 anna stamp.
