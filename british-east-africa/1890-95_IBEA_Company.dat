1890-95 Imperial British East Africa "Sun and Crown" Definitive Issue
Specimen Stamps
½a., 1a., 2a., 8a. blue and 1r. grey, each handstamped "specimen" (BEA1), without gum as usual; ½a. and 1a. with small stains, otherwise fine. A rare group. Photo 

Note: Stamps distributed by the U.P.U. in January 1891 were not overprinted. In November 1890 the IBEA applied a "SPECIMEN" handstamp to five values, as offered above, and attached them to letters promoting the Company's stamps

Estimate £800 to £1,000.}

Imperforate proof sheets for the new company issue were sent to Mombasa, and the majority
of these proofs to the 1 rupee value were subsequently openly sold for postage. Their
purchase, however, was monopolised by H. L. Hayman, a London collector/dealer. Most
of the stamps were used in imperforate pairs as postage to London between March 1892
and October 1894, and at least five covers exist, all heavily over-franked. The complete
range of used pairs are in the frames; unused pairs are generally considerably scarcer, and
I am handing these round for your inspection, together with unused imperforate blocks of
the 2 1/2 and 3 anna values.
