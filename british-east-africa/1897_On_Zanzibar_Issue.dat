\chapter{1897 "On Zanzibar" Issue}

\heading{SG80-85}

A further stamp shortage at Mombasa in January 1897 was overcome by using overprinted
and surcharged stamps of Zanzibar. These were held in many quarters to be unnecessary
issues, and Remington incurred considerable long-range criticism. Remington
was subsequently exonerated when it was revealed that his estimate of stamp sales for
1896-97 (25,777 rupees) had failed to anticipate the greatly increased demand, and actual
sales totalled 62,800 rupees.
