\chapter{1896-1901 Small Queen De La Rue Definitive Issue}
I referred earlier to the new definitive issue in hand for British East Africa, and propose to
read from two letters recorded in John Easton's De La Rue History to 1901.
A note from the Foreign Office dated 13 July 1895: 'Sir Percy Anderson presents his
compliments to Messrs De La Rue and would be obliged if they would send a gentleman
to the Foreign Office to discuss the question of a stamp for the new British Protectorate in
East Africa. He should be instructed to ask for Mr Walrond Clarke who will be happy to
see him any afternoon next week.'

The result of the visit was confirmed by De La Rue on 17 July: 'With reference to
your letter of the 13th instant, we beg to inform you that we called to see Mr Walrond
Clarke, and have prepared the enclosed rough sketch on tracing paper for the British East
Africa Protectorate Stamp. If this rough sketch properly embodies your requirements, we
will draw a carefully finished design to submit to you for approval.'

I am able to show the actual artist's drawing referred to in the above letter, and you will
note a certain amount of background re-arrangement took place before the final design was
approved on 18 September 1895. For a reason that will become clear, the die proof of
the accepted - and very pleasing - design is shown on a later sheet.
I show a selection from the wide range of ungummed colour trials that were prepared,
also two coloured proofs on gummed paper. The firm forwarded a colour scheme for the
fifteen value issue on 14 November 1895, and I am aware of two sets formed from the colour
trials and completed with handpainted duties. I am passing a set round for your inspection,
and it is interesting that the shades of the two blue stamps - the 2£ anna and the 1 rupee - were reversed before printing of the issued stamps commenced.
