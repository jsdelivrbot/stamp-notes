\chapter{1895 Imperial Administration}

The company postmaster at Mombasa - Thomas Remington - gained considerable promotion from the new regime, being appointed Postmaster---General of both the British East Africa and Zanzibar Protectorates. Remington's immediate problem was to reflect the changed status on the stamps, and the small stock of the company issue remaining at Mombasa on 1 July was handstamped under his supervision. Unused blocks of these stamps are scarce, and it is significant that blocks of three values only are recorded in the Royal Collection. I am able to show six values in unused blocks, a notable item being a corner multiple of eight of the 8 anna stamp.
