RARE EARLY EXPEDITION COVER TO KILIMANJARO VIA U.S. CONSUL IN ZANZIBAR; 3 June 1861 env. (slightly reduced at left and with some staining - mainly at bottom left clear of stamps & address, caused - according to Robson Lowe himself - when it was rescued from a bonfire!) from Bradford (Yorks.) addressed to ìRichard Thornton Esqr., Care of Mr. Webb (American Consul), Zanzibar, East Africaî is franked for the 7d rate (with 1d Red + 6d lilac tied by Bradford ì107î numerals) and was endorsed via ìSouthampton & Adenî. There is a 3 July ìADEN STR. POINTî backstamp, so it would have travelled there via the P&O ëBeharí from Suez, and then on to the Seychelles (where the P.O. did not open until 11 Dec. 1861!). It would have arrived at Zanzibar (where there was no P.O. until 1868) on c.22 July 1861 whence William G. Webb (1835-96), the U.S. consul would have forwarded it the 200 miles inland (along with supplies carried by porters for the von der Decken Expedition at Mount Kilimanjaro, which they attempted to climb during 19 days in July 1861) from which the Expedition returned to Zanzibar by Nov. 1861. This is the only recorded cover to Thornton during this brief Kilimanjaro Expedition, and one of the earliest recorded letters addressed to Zanzibar. The famous Tanzanian Mount Kilimanjaro was first sighted by a European in 1848. Subsequent expeditions to explore the mountain were mounted in 1859-63 (led by Baron von der Decken) when Englishman, Richard Thornton, made the first map of the mountain), in 1884, 1887 & 1888 before it was finally climbed in 1889. The 1859-63 Decken Expedition to the mountain lured Richard Thornton away from Livingstoneís ìZambezi Expeditionî (from which he had been temporarily sacked in June 1859); this English geologist returned to Livingstoneís Expedition in March 1863, only to die of fever at Tete on 21 April 1863. [This cover was probably in his personal effects on both expeditions and is thought to have returned to England with his other effects after his death. Very little mail was sent to Zanzibar before 1870, although it was the gateway for explorers/supplies destined for the interior of Africa from the 1840s. Highly Important early letter from this part of East Africa. [Ex Robson Lowe's personal collection.]		Estimated Value: £1500
