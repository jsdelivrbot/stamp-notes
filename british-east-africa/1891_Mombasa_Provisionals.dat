\chapter{1891 Mombasa Provisionals}

The manuscript provisional first appeared during 1891 to overcome a temporary local
shortage of 1/2 anna and 1 anna stamps, and bear the authorising initials of responsible
officials in Mombasa. An exhibition judge of international standing has expressed to me his misgivings when faced with these provisional, but it is my experience that complete forgeries of the manuscript are infrequently seen. A proportion of the stamps were, however, used for fiscal purposes, and numerous cleaned copies exist bearing a subsequently applied
Mombasa cancellation. The dates encountered in these dubious cancellations are 21 Febuary
1891 and 30 February 1891; the two stamps principally selected for 'treatment' were
the 1 anna brown (SG 26) and the 1/2 annas 'error' (SG 22a).

Covers of this issue are extremely rare with only two recorded. \ref{provisionalcover} shows the only known block of the issue and one of two covers known.
