\section{Tonga, Stamps and Postal history}
The postal history of Tonga can be traced to 1886, with the issuance of postage stamps featuring the image of King George Tupou I.[1]

\section{Tin Can mail}

In the early part of the 20th century, philatelists began seeking out
postal cancellations from Niuafo'ou, a volcanic Tongan island. Since Niuafo'ou
lacked a deep water harbor to accommodate ships, postal deliveries were 
received via the so-called "Tin Can Mail" system of having mail thrown 
overboard in biscuit tins and retrieved by local swimmers.[2]



\section{Self-adhesive stamps}

In 1963, Tonga issued the world's first self-adhesive stamps, 
an event which was celebrated by numismatics.[3] The stamps were 
also circular in shape and printed on embossed gilt-foiled paper, 
thus matching the design of the coins being commemorated.[4] 
Subsequent philatelic issues employed other off-beat designs --including 
stamps shaped like hearts, birds and fruit-- and Tonga continued to issue
self-adhesive stamps printed on paper.[4] Although several of 
the stamps were too big for placement on conventional first-class
mailing envelopes, Tonga's unusual postage stamps have 
become popular with philatelists around the world.[5]

Recent developments

In April 2008, the Tongan government announced the Tongan
Post Office would be corporatized. However, the Tongan Post
Office was not included in the 2008 effort to privatize 
other agencies and departments run by the government.[6]
