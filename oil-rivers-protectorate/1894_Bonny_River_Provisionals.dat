# 1894 Bonny River Provisionals

At the beginning of august 1894 the Bonny River Post Office also experienced shortages of the half-penny and then the one-penny values.

Initially one-penny stamps were bisected (but with no surcharge) and as Opobo this action created a shortage of one-penny stamps which was met by bisecting two-penny stamps, again with no surcharge.

The following were bisected in the manner indicated:

\begin{tabular}{cll}
SG No & Value & \textbf{Form of bisect}\\
2     & one-penny lilac 1892  & diagonal or vertical\\
3     & two penny green/carmine 1892      &diagonal or vertical
\end{tabular}
