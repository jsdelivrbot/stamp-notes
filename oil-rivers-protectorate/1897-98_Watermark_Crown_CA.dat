The administration of the Protectorate was, in 1896, transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office. Later that year the stamp requirements were now printed on paper watermarked with acrown CA to mark the change but using the 1894 plates.

The lower values were first to be so printed, the one-penny appearing in MArch 1897, followed by the half-penny and two penny in July. The two-and-a-half-penny appeared in August but the five penny and one-shilling did not appear until 1898. Watermark varieties exist and they are extremely rare, possibly on one sheet only.
