Whenever a series of British Colonial issues has been locally surcharged in the colony, the possibility of errors in the printing arising is very high. The 1893 and 1894 Provisionals of Niger Coast have given rise to many such errors and varieties and the study of them has been a fascination to philatelists for more than 100 years.
