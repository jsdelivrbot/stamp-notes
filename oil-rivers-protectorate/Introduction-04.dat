###The December 1893 1/- Provisional

There was an alleged shortage of the 1/- value at the Old Calabar post office
and this was countered by surcharging the 1892 2d. green and carmine with
the words  halfdOne / Shilling halfd and a bar through the old denomination. As in the  halfd
d. provisionals, a trial sheet was issued, with the surcharge in 2 types and 3
colours, violet, vermilion and black and various positions.
The pair below shows SG 37 se-tenant with SG 38b, surcharge diagonal. This
is one of two known examples and is ex Hind and Dale-Lichtenstein.

a perfect well struck surcharge, o.g., light vertical crease and

with surcharge reading down, this is the unique example outside of the 
Royal Collection of an inverted and diagonal surcharge reading down;
