 The British sphere of interest in the Niger basin was internationally recognized in 1885, as the second British outpost in the Niger river region, after Lagos (1862). The administrative center 1885-1894 was at {{wi:Bonny}}; British consuls were stationed at Old Calabar. In 1891 the Oil Rivers Protectorate was formally proclaimed, named after Palm Oil, the major export product. In 1893 it was extended and re-named the Niger Coast Protectorate. In 1900 this enlarged protectorate was amalgamated with the southern part of the territory that had been administered by the Royal Niger Company to form the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria (1900-1914).
In 1885 the Oil River Irregulars were established, a unit of Africans commanded by British officers. In 1891 they were renamed the Oil Rivers Constabulary; they served in several campaigns against native emirates. In 1893 they were renamed Niger Coast Constabulary.

In 1892 the British undertook an expedition against Ijebu, the only Yoruba state to refuse access to missionaries. The Ijebu army was routed; the Yoruba states recognized British military superiority and signed treaties. In 1895 the British took the city of Oyo under artillery fire, to force the ruler of Oyo to accept British conditions. When several Englishmen had been killed in the Kingdom of Benin in 1897, the British launched an expedition, confiscated their art treasures and burnt the capital. 

Postage stamps and postal history

The main post office was established at Old Calabar in November 1891; sub-offices existed at Benin, Bonny, Brass, Opobo, and Warri. Initially the postage stamps of Britain were used; in July 1892 they were overprinted with "BRITISH / PROTECTORATE / OIL / RIVERS". A pressing need for halfpenny values in mid-1893 resulted in a variety of surcharges on 2d and 2 1/2d stamps. While most simply read "HALF / PENNY", with a horizontal bar to obliterate the old value, some were overprinted "1/2 d" twice, with the intent that they be bisected diagonally to produce two 1/2d stamps.

The name change occurred just as new stamps were being prepared, and so the first issue of the Niger Coast Protectorate, featuring a 3/4 portrait of Queen Victoria, was inscribed "OIL RIVERS" but obliterated and overprinted "NIGER COAST". Available in November 1893, they were superseded the following May by stamps in a new design and the correct inscription. These stamps continued for the remainder of the protectorate's existence, with a change over to use the "Crown & CA" watermark from 1897 on (the paper had previously been unwatermarked).


Most of the illustrations here are from scans of the Neal M. Allen Collection of Niger Coast sold by Shreeves in 2004.
It included most of the important varieties. The balance are from my own collection and various other sources,

Whenever a series of British Colonial issues has been locally surcharged in
the colony, the possibility of errors in the printing arising is very high. The
1893 and 1894 Provisionals of Niger Coast have given rise to many such
errors and varieties and the study of them has been a fascination to
philatelists for more than 100 years. The Gian-Maria Rossi collection, to be
offered by Warwick and Warwick on June 8th,
contains a superb selection of these provisionals, including unique items and
rare se-tenants, where the only other known examples are in the Royal
Collection.

By the beginning of September 1893, the post office at Old Calabar had run
short of � d. stamps, so 4 half sheets of 120 stamps of the 1d. lilac were
surcharged locally by a diagonal line, running from the bottom left to the top
right corners, each half thus formed being handstamped � d, parallel to the
diagonal line. __The surcharge was applied in a setting covering one horizontal
row at a time__. The top row of 10 stamps (20 surcharged stamps) of the first
sheet was surcharged in violet ink. However, it was thought that the colour did
not contrast sufficiently with the body colour of the stamp and vermilion was
selected for the remaining rows. The Rossi collection included a block of 4
surcharges, F.U., from the first 2 rows of the first sheet, the top pair showing
the surcharge in violet and the lower pair in vermilion. 

Robson Lowe notes that only four half sheets were surcharged. The issue therefore, comprised 24 copies of the 1/2p
copies in villet and 936 in vermilion (960 values in all).

__The type was evidently loose and fell out frequently and was carelessly replaced. Used copies are
generally found cancelled__ __OLD CALABAR RIVER__.

On only the 1st sheet of the 4 surcharged, on row 3, stamps 3 and 8 both
received the diagonal dividing line running from top left to bottom right, with
the orientation of the � d. overprint similarly reversed. It is believed that two
unsevered pairs with reversed surcharge are known. The Rossi collection
includes a F.U. se-tenant block of 4, one unsevered pair with surcharge
reversed and one pair normal.

###The December 1893 1/- Provisional

There was an alleged shortage of the 1/- value at the Old Calabar post office
and this was countered by surcharging the 1892 2d. green and carmine with
the words �One / Shilling� and a bar through the old denomination. As in the �
d. provisionals, a trial sheet was issued, with the surcharge in 2 types and 3
colours, violet, vermilion and black and various positions.
The pair below shows SG 37 se-tenant with SG 38b, surcharge diagonal. This
is one of two known examples and is ex Hind and Dale-Lichtenstein.
