\chapter{Curacao Stamps and Postal History}  

The first postage stamps of Curaçao (the name was used for the six islands collectively when the areas was named Curaçao and Dependencies and Territory of Curaçao]) were issued 23 May 1873;[1] they depicted William III in profile, and were inscribed "CURAÇAO", as were all issues for the next 77 years. The six original values (2½c to 50c) were joined by a 2.50-gulden value in 1879, a 12½c in 1886, and four more values in 1889. All of these were issued without gum (due to the heat and humidity) until 1890.

In 1889 a longstanding tradition began with the issuance of low-value (1c to 5c) stamps showing only a large numeral. In 1891 the 30c value was surcharged 25c. Meanwhile, the passing of William left his daughter Wilhelmina to be among the youngest persons depicted on a stamp to that date, with five values appearing between 1892 and 1896. Only the vignette actually changed.

Additional surcharges were needed periodically; 2½c in 1895, and in 1901/1902 they were applied to stamps of the Netherlands. A new definitive series came out in 1904, with numeral in a horizontal layout for low values, and Wilhelmina in a circular frame for the higher values. Additional values were added in 1906 and 1908.



In 1915 a new series reused designs from the Netherlands Indies stamps of a few years previously. The low-value numbers were changed to have a white instead of a hatched background, for readability, while medium values showed the Queen and a ship at sea, with the highest values showing the Queen flanked by palm trees. These stamps continued as the standard for many years, with some values getting color changes; for instance, the 5c was originally rose, then changed to green in 1922, then to lilac in 1926.

The first commemorative stamps, in 1923, celebrated Wilhelmina's 25th anniversary, depicting her with a finely-engraved portrait. The portrait was reused in the definitive series of 1928, which added a steamship to the bottom of the design.
In 1934, a series of 17 types marked the 300th anniversary of the colony; designs included portraits of figures significant in history, plus a view of Van Walbeecks' ship.
1936 saw a new definitive series, with the usual lower values as numerals, now vertical in an oval frame, while from 10c on up was a profile of Wilhelmina wearing a sort of shawl or veil drawn back; a depiction of the Queen not seen any other stamps of the Dutch area.

15c, 1941
The 40th anniversary issue in 1938 and the definitives of 1941/1942/1947 reverted to the use of the same profiles of Wilhelmina as the Netherlands and the Netherlands Indies.
A set of 15 airmail stamps in October 1942 were bi-colored designs showing airplanes, maps, and scenery in various combinations; they were soon followed by set of six regular issues in 1943 that were also bi-colored, each with a scenic view of a different island. A last set of airmail stamps appeared in 1947, the lower values a stylized plane and posthorn design, and the higher showing a DC-4 skimming the waves.

A 1948 set of 11, showing white-haired Wilhelmina in profile, quickly became dated as Queen Juliana was invested with the crown in September; she appeared on a pair of stamps commemorating the occasion in September.
