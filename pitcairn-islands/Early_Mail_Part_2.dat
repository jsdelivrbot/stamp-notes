cover with Burke Family crest embossed in red on the flap, to Ireland with a very fine strike of the first recorded postal marking 'Pitcairn/Island' (CK #1.1) at lower-left, United States 5c Garfield (corner fault at lower-right) cancelled in transit with 'NEW YORK/DEC29/83 - 12 ' duplex, light 'DUBLIN' arrival b/s (affected by opening tear), minor piece missing from the reverse. The earliest recorded stamped cover from Pitcairn Island & thus a remarkably significant item that has probably never before been offered at auction. [Unrecorded by Bill Hornadge. Cy Kitching records usage until 1891 but this is the only cover we have recorded]

cover to England with a very fine strike of the second postal marking 'PITCAIRN ISLAND' with quotation marks (CK #1.2) in rosine at lower-left, United States 5c Grant cancelled in transit with 'SAN FRANCISCO CAL/FEB26/91 - 17' duplex, very fine 'BOURNEMOUTH/16MR91' arrival b/s (affected by opening tear), ironed-out vertical fold & minor soiling/toning. Another highly significant item that also has probably never before been offered at auction. [Unrecorded by Bill Hornadge. Cy Kitching records usage between 1890 & 1900 but this is the only cover we have recorded. We do wonder if Captain Kitching was guessing about the period of use. It's certainly possible that usage of #2 overlapped with #1, but we consider that it's unlikely. Also, he obviously hadn't sighted an example because the ink colour is noted as "struck in ?"]
With note from the addressee dated 19.3.1891 & signed "ECopeman" stating "I have great pleasure in forwarding one of the Envelopes as discussed", which explains the central fold. He goes on to talk about seeds sent to Pitcairn for a trial planting. The cover was almost certainly carried per the barque "Pitcairn Island" which departed 14/1/1891 bound for San Francisco.
