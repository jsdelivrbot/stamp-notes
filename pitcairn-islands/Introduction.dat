##Pitcairn Islands: Postal History and Stamps

The Pitcairn Islands, officially named the Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands, are a group of four volcanic islands in the southern Pacific Ocean. The islands are a British overseas territory (formerly a British colony), the last remaining in the Pacific. Only Pitcairn Island--the second largest--is inhabited.

The islands are best known for being the home of the descendants of the Bounty mutineers and the Tahitians who accompanied them, an event retold in numerous books and films. This story is still apparent in the surnames of many of the islanders. With only 48 inhabitants (from nine families), Pitcairn is also notable for being the least populated jurisdiction in the world (although it is not a sovereign nation). 
The United Nations Committee on Decolonisation includes the Pitcairn Islands on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.[2]

The islanders reported that it was not until 27 December 1795 that the first ship since the Bounty was seen from the island, but as she did not approach the land, they could not make out to what nation she belonged. A second appeared some time in 1801, but did not attempt to communicate with them. A third came sufficiently near to see their habitations, but did not venture to send a boat on shore. The American trading ship Topaz under the command of Mayhew Folger was the first to visit the island and communicate with them when they spent 10 hours at Pitcairn in February 1808. A report of Folger's find was forwarded to The Admiralty mentioning the mutineers and a more precise location of the islandï¿½latitude 25Â° 2' S and 130Â° longitude/,[7]ï¿½however this rediscovery was not known to Sir Thomas Staines who commanded a Royal Navy flotilla of two ships (HMS Briton and HMS Tagus) which found the island at 25Â°.4' S. (by meridian observation) on 17 September 1814. Staines sent a party ashore and wrote a detailed report for the Admiralty.[8][9][10]

The island became a British colony in 1838 and was among the first territories to extend voting rights to women. By the mid-1850s the Pitcairn community was outgrowing the island and its leaders appealed to the British government for assistance. They were offered Norfolk Island and on 3 May 1856, the entire community of 193 people set sail for Norfolk on board the Morayshire, arriving on 8 June after a miserable five-week trip. But after eighteen months on Norfolk, seventeen of the Pitcairners returned to their home island; five years later another twenty-seven did the same.

Since a population peak of 233 in 1937, the island has been suffering from emigration, primarily to New Zealand, leaving some fifty people living on Pitcairn.

There are allegations of a long history and tradition of sexual abuse of girls as young as 7, which culminated in 2004 in the charging of seven men living on Pitcairn, and another six now living abroad, with sex-related offences, including rape. On 25 October 2004, six men were convicted, including Steve Christian, the island's mayor at the time. See Pitcairn rape trial of 2004. After the six men lost their final appeal, the British government set up a prison on the island with an annual budget of NZD 950,000. The men began serving their sentences in late 2006, and all are expected to be freed by December 2008.

__With a population of only around fifty, the people of Pitcairn are descended from the mutineers of 
HMAV Bounty and their Tahitian companions. Pitcairn Island is approximately 3.2km (2 miles) long and 1.6km (1 mile) 
wide with the capital Adamstown located above Bounty Bay and accessed by the aptly named road, "The Hill of Difficulty".__

On August 1 the Alexander Turnbull Library acquired a significant collection of papers relating to Baron Charles de Philippe de Thierry (1793-1884). The Baron was a particularly colourful character in New Zealand's early history, trying several times unsuccessfully to establish himself as the head of a New Zealand colony.

Records of his grandiose activities are scattered around the world, particularly in the public archives of those countries that had to deal with the consequences of his plans. A particularly important document, his unpublished autobiography is also held at the Auckland City Library. However, the items acquired by the Alexander Turnbull Library comprise the single largest known collection of items relating to the de Thierry familyï¿½s activities in New Zealand.

The collection includes 60 letters to the Baron and his sons, and ten from the Baron to various recipients, including Governor William Hobson. There are papers relating to family history, accounts, land claims, births and deaths and testimonials. Finally, there are four pencil sketches and a very rough watercolour of what appears to be the Baron's Hokianga settlement.

In 1820 the Baron met Hongi Hika and Thomas Kendall, and for the mere price of 36 axes, claimed to have bought himself 40,000 acres at Hokianga. For the next 20 years he tried unsuccessfully to gain French support for his bid to become head of the colony. After a wandering life in the Americans, he arrived in New Zealand in 1837 and was granted 800 acres only. His final hopes were dashed by the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.

This collection has new documentation not previously available to researchers. It will be useful for any biographical study of de Thierry as well as studies of the times of which he was a notable part. It is an important addition to our research collections relating to early New Zealand history in the years on either side of the Treaty.
