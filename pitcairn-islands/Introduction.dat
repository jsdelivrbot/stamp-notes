# Pitcairn Islands: Postal History and Stamps

The Pitcairn Islands, officially named the Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands, are a group of four volcanic islands in the southern Pacific Ocean. The islands are a British overseas territory (formerly a British colony), the last remaining in the Pacific. Only Pitcairn Island--the second largest--is inhabited.

The islands are best known for being the home of the descendants of the Bounty mutineers and the Tahitians who accompanied them, an event retold in numerous books and films. This story is still apparent in the surnames of many of the islanders. With only 48 inhabitants (from nine families), Pitcairn is also notable for being the least populated jurisdiction in the world (although it is not a sovereign nation). 
The United Nations Committee on Decolonisation includes the Pitcairn Islands on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.[2]

1925two generally fine strikes in violet at top of letter headed "Pitcairn Island/Oct 21 1928" & signed "Richard Edgar Christian/(Postmaster)" who mentions the handstamp impressions "...we use [sic] on our own letters before becoming a branch of the New Zealand Post Office". Various authorities quote 7/6/1927 as the Opening Day of the Agency but Christian states it "first opened July 12 1927". This suggests that the earlier date was the intended or official opening date but that there was actually a 5 weeks delay. We note that James Brill had a purported 7th June Opening Day cover but our assessment is that it's as phony as a $3 bill]

The postal history of the Pitcairn Islands can be traced to early whaling vessels that visitsecond half of the 19th centud the area and later when outgoing mail was hand stamped as "Posted on Pitcairn Island: no stamps available." 

Stamps were carried by passing ships and received postal stamps and cancellation at various ports of calls.[2] However, this practice was discontinued in 1926 following reports of ship passengers mixing their own mail into the “no stamp” system set aside for the Pitcairn residents.

In June 1927, a postal agency was set up on Pitcairn to sell New Zealand stamps. The first Pitcairn postage stamps, consisting of eight denominations, were issued on October 15, 1940.

The New Zealand-based Pitcairn Islands Philatelic Bureau coordinates the territory’s stamp program. The program issues up to six commemorative stamps per year, and new definitive stamps are issued on an average cycle of five years. The sale of philatelic issues has been a source of revenue for the territory for many years.
