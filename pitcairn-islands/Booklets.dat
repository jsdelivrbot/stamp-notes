\ph[90%]{../pitcairn-islands/SB1var.jpg}{S.G. #SB1 var., 1940 King George V complete booklet, a provisional booklet made up by Postmaster Roy Clark after the original supply of booklets was exhausted (approximately 1943), these are identical to the issued booklet with the same cover that folds around, and including a single stamp of each value of the first issue of Pitcairn issue and identical wax paper interleaving, the 2/6 value in this booklet is a top right corner single with control no. 255, Clark lacked a stapler so he used a small paper fastener to hold the booklet together, fresh and attractive, all the covers that were available to the Clark had small flaws, this has a faint diagonal bend, very fine; the interesting origin of these booklets is revealed in a letter from Roy Clark to Dr. Arthur Delaney after the war, "..of our first issue (1940) a few booklets were sent here for sale. These were soon sold out. The Government never has renewed booklets, though I did for a few friends of mine make up a few empty covers that came with the shipment. I have no idea of the number of booklets sold. Those I made were not many."; it is believed that less than fifteen booklets were made by Postmaster Roy Clark; another great booklet rarity of Pitcairn Island.  Est. $2,000-3,000
