EARLY INGOING COVER FROM G.B. WITH BLUE-GREEN "SYDNEY/NSW" ARRIVAL C.D.S.; 16 Apr. 1830 EL from Liverpool to "Mr Robert Foster, Messrs. Aspinall Browne \& Co., Sydney" (a merchant firm with an office in Liverpool G.B. as well) endorsed "P [Ship] Juno"; there is a small manuscript "4" arrival Ship Letter charge on the front along with a partly fine blue-green "SYDNEY/NSW/N 30/1830" c.d.s. with part frame. The letter, most unusually, has been cross-written in black and red inks - so as to save paper and postage. Ingoing mail to Sydney at this early date is seldom seen. Not previously offered for sale; from a new 'find'. Later in Browne's career (1832) he was involved in an acrimonious libel case with the bad-tempered Postmaster of Bong-Bong, N.S.W.!}

\ph[60%]{../new-south-wales/early-01.jpg}{PAIR OF FALMOUTH \& LIVERPOOL "INDIA LETTER" COVERS TO G.B.; 10 Dec. 1834 \& 22 Apr. 1835 pair of ELs to the same London address endorsed "P. B[ritish] Sovereign" or "P. Coboten" (?), having fair red boxed "INDIA LETTER/FALMOUTH" or very fine black boxed "INDIA LETTER/LIVERPOOL" marks on the flaps. Both letters are signed by the well-known Sydney merchant "Richard Jones" (1786-1852; see Aust. DNB) who was one of the city's richest whaling merchants. (2 covers)}

EARLY "DEAL/INDIA LETTER" \& "PER FAVOUR" COVERS TO G.B.; 30 Sept. 1834 \& 24 May 1837 pair of ELs from Sydney to the same London address; the first prepaid 4d Ship Letter rate with a mainly fine red oval "POST PAID SHIP LR/SYDNEY" d.s. on the front and an overstruck red boxed "DEAL/INDIA LETTER" on the flap, the other endorsed "Per favour Capt John Kean" and apparently carried the whole way (breaking the strick Ship Letter rules) by a ship's Captain. Both are written by the wife of Australia's first lunatic, James Birnie (1762-1844; see Aust. DNB); one asks for a "comfortable [post] chaise" to be sent from England, and the other describes a box of seeds and plants that the writer has sent over from Sydney to London. (2 covers)}

UDC on the front beside a very fine black crowned oval "GENERAL POST OFFICE/*/SYDNEY" d.s. (14 Feb.) and overlapped by a faint red "CORK/PENNY POST" transit mark; there is also a very faint red octagon-boxed "PAID AT/PARRAMATTA" beneath the Sydney d.s.; charged "1/-" and then "1/10" with a partial boxed "INDIA LETTER/RAMSGATE" on the flap; carried by the 'Governor Harcourt' - 149 days.
