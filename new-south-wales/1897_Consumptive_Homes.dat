\chapter{1897 Consumptive Homes/Diamond Jubilee}

The first semi-postal was actually a postal card; to commemorate the Uniform Penny Post in 1890, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland issued a card with a face value of one penny, but sold it for sixpence, with the difference given to a fund for postal workers. The first semi-postal stamps were issued by the Australian colonies of New South Wales and Victoria, who both marked the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897 with stamps denominated in pennies, but sold for shillings, a 12x increase over the face value.

Description: 1897 Consumptive Homes/Diamond Jubilee 1d (1/-) \& 2½d (2/6d) SG 280-1 blocks of 4, lightly mounted, Cat £840++. Beautiful multiples of the world's first charity-stamp issue (and first multicolour lithographed stamp).
This was a highly controversial issue for more than one reason. The surcharge over the face value was widely denounced; as was the rationing of the stamps to subscribers, which resulted in very few blocks surviving.

notice (the italics being our own):

" CONSUMPTIVES' HOSPITAL POSTAGE STAMPS.—The Postmaster-General, at the
request of His Excellency the Governor, has made arrangements for the issue of two
special postage stamps .designed to enable charitable and loyal persons to at once
contribute to the fund for establishing the Consumptives' Hospital, and to obtain an
attractive souvenir of Her Majesty's Record Reign.

"The stamps will have the postal values of id. and 2|d., but will be sold to the
public at is. and 23. 6d. respectively; the amount thus realized in excess of the postal
value will be devoted to the Hospital Fund.

" The design for the is. stamp has for a central vignette an angelic figure supporting
in her arms an exhausted being, helpless and in need of sympathy.* The vignette is
surrounded by an ornamental frame, from the left upper corner of which springs the
initial letter ' C' of the title ' Consumptives' Home,' which occupies the top of the
frame; and in the right upper corner is shown a portrait of Her Majesty the Queen.
At the sides the figures '1837, 1897' are enclosed in diamond outlines. In the two
lower corners the value, 'is.,' is shown, while the space between is occupied by the
inscription, ' N. S. W., Postage One Penny.' The frame is in dark green, and the
central vignette in sepia.

" In the as. 6d. stamp the motive of ' restoration' or ' rebuilding' is typified by
two figures draped in white, the strong gently leading the weak, as she points to the
motto, ' Redifico.' This vignette is placed in a diamond frame, above which are the
words ' Consumptives' Home' inscribed on a riband. A circle of gold forms the background,
upon which the flannel flower and waratah are displayed. In the left lower
corner is a medallion bearing the figures ' 2/6,' while the base of the design is
inscribed 'N. S. W., Postage 2jd.' This stamp is printed in gold, blue, rose, and
carmine. Both designs are four times the size of an ordinary postage stamp, and are
the work of Mr. Charles Turner, of Sydney.

" The issue throughout the colony will be strictly limited to 10,000 of the 2s. 6d.
and 40,000 of the is. value. The is. stamp will be on sale at the General Post Office
on Tuesday, and arrangements are now in progress for the production of the 25. 6d.
stamp at the Government Printing Office, and it is anticipated that it will be ready on
Saturday next. Supplies of both values will be obtainable at Post Offices throughout
the colony on and after the 28th instant. The period of sale and validity for postal
use is to be limited to two months." cite{LP068.pdf}
