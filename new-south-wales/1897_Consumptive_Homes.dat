\chapter{1897 Consumptive Homes/Diamond Jubilee}

The first semi-postal was actually a postal card; to commemorate the Uniform Penny Post in 1890, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland issued a card with a face value of one penny, but sold it for sixpence, with the difference given to a fund for postal workers. The first semi-postal stamps were issued by the Australian colonies of New South Wales and Victoria, who both marked the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897 with stamps denominated in pennies, but sold for shillings, a 12x increase over the face value.

This was a highly controversial issue for more than one reason. The surcharge over the face value was widely denounced; as was the rationing of the stamps to subscribers, which resulted in very few blocks surviving.
