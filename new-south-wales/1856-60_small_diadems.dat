I now come to the 2d. value. I have left this to the last because this is the
particular stamp I want to talk about to-night. This is, I consider, the most
interesting of all the New South Wales stamps, and I have been making a special
study of it for about seven years. The 2d. plate was first printed from it
December 1855, but none were issued in that year. The first issue for use was
about the middle of January 1856. 

The numbers given are : 1855—13,200,
1856—1,858,800, and in the first quarter of 1857—288,000. The stock of paper
watermark 2 was then exhausted and recourse was had to paper watermark 5,
a total of 383,000 being printed on that paper. In May a new stock of paper
watermarked 2 arrived, and from May to December 1857 1,242,000 were printed,
and in 1858—2,395,200. In March 1858 a small lot of paper watermarked 5
was used up, giving only 2,520 stamps ; in 1859—2,736,360 stamps were printed
on the 2 paper and in January 1860—234,000. Making grand totals of
Watermark 2 = 8,600,280
Watermark 5 = 385,520

and the records say less allowance for those which were spoiled or destroyed.
2d. stamps watermarked 1 and watermarked 8 are known, but these are so very
rare that it is thought only one sheet of each watermark was printed, having got
among the watermark 2 paper by some error or oversight.
Towards the end of 1858 the 2d. plate was damaged by overheating, and
attempts were made to repair the damage by retouching a number of the subjects.
I shall return to the subject of these damaged and retouched stamps later on
in this paper.

In consequence of this damage a new plate was ordered from London. A
further proposal was made that in the meantime an experiment should be tried
and an attempt made to print the stamps by the lithographic process. This
was approved on July 21/59, but there are no records of any such printing. We

In this introduction, we cannot decribe or show adequately the retouches, however the
figure below is a striking example of the third retouch, when the design was extensively
redrawn.
