\chapter{The Laureated Issues, 1852-53 6d} 

THE increasing demand for postage stamps, and the difficulty
experienced in coping with this demand by printing from
the small plates of the first issue, impelled Mr. Raymond,
Postmaster-General, to consider some means for securing a
more rapid method of production.

As early as 5th January,
1850, he called the attention of the Colonial Secretary to
the difficulty, and suggested the advisability of obtaining three steel plates
from England, containing at least one hundred impressions of each stamp.
However, England was a long way off, and the means of communication
were very slow. The Postmaster-General, therefore, did not at the time
further urge that his suggestion should be carried out. He appears to have
taken steps to obtain estimates from local engravers as to the cost of making
plates, for on the 28th October, 1850, he wrote to the Colonial Secretary,
returning a tender from Mr. Robert Clayton, offering to engrave a steel
plate for postage stamps, at the same time observing that from the trouble
and disappointment sustained the previous year by Mr. Clayton's nonperformance
of the work he engaged to undertake, and the manner in which
he engraved the one penny stamp then in use, he did not feel justified in
recommending his employment on the present occasion. 

He took the
opportunity, however, of reporting that he had communicated with several
engravers with a view to obtaining steel plates for the postage stamps,
and begged to submit an offer from Mr. Carmichael, who he believed to
be the most competent engraver in Sydney, to furnish the plates according
to a design accompanying the letter, or such other as might be decided upon,
at twenty-five shillings each stamp. Although he considered the price high,
he feared that there was no alternative but to accept the offer, Mr. Ham
having intimated his inability to come up from Melbourne to undertake the
work, as he had at first proposed, and his tender, even, was higher than
Mr. Carmichael's. Mr. Raymond also stated that Mr. H. C. Jervis, the only
other engraver he could find willing to execute the work, offered to do them
at sixteen shillings each stamp, but as the threepenny plate then in use,
furnished by him (Jervis), was certainly not a good specimen pf engraving,
he was unwilling to entrust the business to him.

In replying to a letter written by the New Zealand Government, asking
for particulars respecting plates for postage stamps, Mr. Raymond threw a
little more light on the matter. Under date 2gth November, 1850, he
wrote:—

\ph[30%]{../new-south-wales/9566.jpg}{
Lot: 2236		Sale: 69 Australian States: The Leslie Digby Nelson collection of New South Wales: The Laureated Issues, 1853 8d., the three shades, each with three margins, also another torn and extensively repaired, and 8d. proof in blue. (5) S.G. 79-81, at. £1,800+. Price Realised £210.}    

"I do myself the honour to state that the engraver who is employed preparing new
plates for this Department is willing to furnish three similar ones for the New Zealand
Government, each containing twenty-five stamps, for ^112 io/-, to be completed by
the 3oth November, 1851. . . . It will doubtless be in your* recollection that when
the Act introducing the system of prepayment of postage by stamps was passed much
difficulty was experienced in procuring plates, and the law coming into operation in
little more than two months and a half after being assented to, it was found necessary
as a temporary expedient to get three plates, containing twenty-five t stamps each, from
three different engravers.

"These plates being on copper are objectionable, as they require to be renewed,
and the impression thus becomes altered.  It was therefore determined to get three steel
plates, adopting the Queen's head, with New South Wales Postage as the design, and
Mr. Carmichael, who is the best engraver in Sydney, is now engaged upon them, but
they will not be completed before the end of June, when he will be prepared to undertake
those for the New Zealand Government, should they be required."

Hence it appears evident that the design referred to in the letter of
the 28th October, 1850, consisted of a "Queen's head" with the inscriptions
" NEW SOUTH WALES. POSTAGE," and, presumably, the value in words. The
omission of the name of the colony, in an Anglicised form, from the " View "
stamps seems to have caused some comment, and it was determined to leave
no room for doubt in future issues. It was hardly to be expected that all
the colonists were sufficiently versed in Latin to understand that " NOV.
CAMB. AUST." meant "New South Wales."

On the I3th November, 1850, Mr. Raymond wrote to Mr. John Carmichael
with reference to a personal interview he had had with him relating
to the engraving of the plates, acquainting him that the sanction of His
Excellency the Governor had been received to accept his amended tender
to engrave three steel plates, each containing respectively fifty postage
stamps of one penny, twopenny, and threepenny, of the design and
description with which he had been furnished. Mr. Carmichael was informed
that the plates were to be completed to the satisfaction of the
Government on or before the 3Oth June, 1851, to which effect he would
be required to enter into a bond or agreement should the same be considered
necessary by the Crown Solicitor.

This guarantee as to due execution was evidently considered desirable;
a bond was prepared and forwarded by the Crown Solicitor for execution.
Some time was spent in fruitless negotiations, and on the I5th February,
1851, Mr. Raymond wrote to the Crown Solicitor:—

\begin{blockquote}[shadow]
"Referring to your letter of the 22nd November, forwarding a bond for the
signature of Mr. John Carmichael for the due completion of plates for postage
stamps, I do myself the honour to inform you that, having called upon Mr. Carmichael
to execute the same, he refuses doing so. I therefore beg leave to return
the bond and tender."
\end{blockquote}

Dr. Houison states that Carmichael " was deaf and dumb, but evidently
had a will of his own." Subsequent events point rather to his having wellgrounded
doubts as to his own ability to carry out the work within the
specified time, as it was not until the i6th July, 1851, or sixteen days after
the expiration of the period stipulated for the completion of all three plates,
that the Postmaster-General was able to "submit for the inspection of His
Excellency the Governor-General the new plate for the twopenny postage
stamps, with a proof of the same."

On the Qth June, 1851, Francis Lewis Shaw Merewether, Esq., was
appointed Postmaster-General.

The Postmaster-General forwarded at the same time the old twopenny
plate, which was unserviceable, in order that it might be condemned. As
there was not more than a week's supply of the twopenny postage stamps
printed, Mr. Merewether stated that it would be necessary to immediately
bring the new plate into use, but conceived that before doing so it would be
necessary to publish a notice describing the alteration in the design of the
stamp.

That His Excellency the Governor-General lost no time in giving his
approval is well known. In 1886 Major Evans described this very proof
sheet,* across the face of which was written: "51/6960. Approved. See
Governor-General's Minute on the Back." The endorsement referred to was,
"Approved by my Minute on 51/6960 of this date, C. F. R., i/th July, 1851."
This proof sheet had been removed from the records, and the finder had cut
it up, evidently with the view of removing those impressions which had
escaped the inscription, and could consequently be disposed of at an enhanced
figure as "unused." When the sheet reached Major Evans it consisted
of thirty-nine specimens, all cut separate, with the exception of one
pair. Curiously enough, these stamps had been previously offered to me by
Mr. W. F. Petterd, of Launceston, who had received them from a correspondent
in Sydney. My philatelic eyes not being fully opened at that date,
I saw nothing singular in a lot of " Twopenny Laureates" scribbled over
with the broad marks of a quill pen, and stuck anyhow on a sheet of paper.
I returned them to Mr. Petterd without attempting to decipher the inscription,
or even thinking that the markings contained anything coherent. My
feelings when Maj'or Evans's paper appeared, and I discovered what I had
missed, may well be imagined ! *

The notification which Mr. Merewether pointed out would be necessary
duly appeared in the Government Gazette of the 25th July, 1851, as follows:—

\begin{blockquote}[shadow]

\opening{COLONIAL SECRETARY'S OFFICE, SYDNEY,}

POSTAGE STAMPS.

"Referring to the Government Notice, dated 22nd December, 1849, respecting
the issue of stamps, in accordance with the tenth clause of the Act of the Governor
and Council, i3th Victoria, No. 38, intituled, 'An Act to establish an uniform rate of
Postage, and to consolidate and amend the Law for the conveyance and postage of
Letters] His Excellency the Governor-General directs it to be notified that
it has become necessary to provide new plates, on which, instead of the present
design, there will be engraved the Queen's head, with a laurel wreath and the words
' New South Wales' in the border.

" 2. Twopenny stamps with the above design will immediately be issued.

\closing{By His Excellency's command,}
\closing{E. DBAS THOMSON.}

\end{blockquote}

This notice was repeated verbatim in the Gazettes of the 29th July, ist
and 5th August, 1851, the error made in omitting the word "be" in the
second paragraph remaining unnoticed.

On the 29th July, 1851, the Postmaster-General forwarded Carmichael's
account for the twopenny plate to the Colonial Secretary. In submitting
this claim, Mr. Merewether referred to Carmichael's tender to furnish three
plates for the sum of £150, and suggested that, as he refused to enter into
any engagement for the fulfilment of his tender, it might be desirable, before
any payment was made, to obtain some guarantee that the other plates
would be completed. Carmichael preferred a further claim of _£io for engraving
the words "New South Wales" on the twopenny stamps. 

Mr. Merewether stated that he was informed that these words were in the original
design, and as a matter of right, therefore, Mr. Carmichael seemed to have
no claim to this extra sum.

Carmichael resisted the second attempt to obtain a guarantee for the
completion of the other two plates, but the Inspector of Stamps (Mr.
Manning) having assured the Postmaster-General that he was satisfied
Mr. Carmichael would complete the other plates according to his engagement,
Mr. Merewether recommended the payment of £50 for the twopenny
plate, and as the claim for extra remuneration for alterations had been
reduced to £$, he did not see any objection to that additional allowance.
This completes the records relating to the twopenny of the Laureated
series, so far as regards its preparation and issue in its original state.
I have made a very careful search in the Post Office Letter Books, but
can find no trace of any communication referring to the completion and
handing over of the one penny plate. However, the approximate date
of its completion is shown in the following notice, published in the Government
Gazette of the 23rd December, 1851 :—


" COLONIAL SECRETARY'S OFFICE, SYDNEY,
" 20th December, 1851.

"POSTAGE STAMPS.

"Referring to the Government Notice of the 24th of July last, His Excellency
the Governor-General directs it to be notified that one penny stamps of a new
plate, on which, instead of the present design, there will be engraved the Queen's
head, with a Jaurel wreath and the words 'New South Wales' in the border, will be
immediately issued.

\closing{By His Excellency's command,}
\signature{E. DEAS THOMSON.}

Notwithstanding Mr. Raymond's disparaging remarks with reference to
Jervis's engraving of the threepenny " View " plate, it stood wear and tear
better than the other two values, and in November, 1851, Mr. Merewether
spoke of it in terms of high approval. He said: " The present plate is
copper, and though in use for nearly two years, and has never been repaired,
may be said to be as good as when delivered by the engraver. Being well
cut it would last many years longer."

This fact, and the necessity arising for the immediate provision of a
sixpenny plate, account for the long time which elapsed before the third of
the plates, contracted to be supplied not later than the 3Oth June, 1851, viz.
the threepenny, was delivered.

The following letter relating to the sixpenny plate is quoted in full:—

"GENERAL POST OFFICE, 8f/i March, 1852.
" SIR,—In order to afford greater facility for the affixing of the required value of
stamps on letters chargeable with high postage, and also for the payment of the fee
of sixpence on registered letters, I do myself the honour to recommend that a sixpenny
stamp should be struck off on copper in the Colony for immediate use.
" 2. The demand for these stamps will be comparatively so limited that a copper
plate, if well engraved, will last for a considerable time. The threepenny stamp plate,
although it has been in use for two years, is still perfectly good.
"3. I propose that the plate should contain twenty-five subjects, which will be
sufficient to enable the Inspector of Stamps to meet the demand for these stamps for
a considerable time.

"4. A design which I enclose was prepared by the late Inspector, Mr. Manning,
for a sixpenny stamp, but it is not so difficult of imitation as the design recently
adopted for the other stamps, and I am therefore disposed to recommend that the
latter should be selected, with the necessary substitution of sixpence in strongly
marked characters.
"5. Mr. Carmichael, by whom the other plates have been engraved, will execute
this at the rate of IDS, 6d. per subject, according to Manning's design, and at i6s. a
subject if the Queen's head design be preferred. The cost in the former case will be
^13 as. 6d. and in the latter £20. The cost of this plate can be charged on the
sum of ;£ioo which was voted by the Legislative Council for 'providing and renewing
plates for postage stamps,' independently of the ;£6oo voted on the Supplementary
Estimate for the plates, etc., to be obtained from England.

" I have, etc.,
"T. L. S. MEREWETHER."

Dr. Houison, in his History of the Post Office, speaks of designs for
sixpenny and one shilling stamps, which had been engraved (as essays) by
Carmichael, and illustrates them. Both of these essays bear a Crown as a
central design. The original designs, says Dr. Houison, were drawn by
James Raymond, the Postmaster-General. Mr. Merewether speaks of the
design he submitted as having been prepared by Mr. Manning, the Inspector
of Stamps. It is hardly likely that two sets of designs were furnished by
Post Office officials for the same purpose, and I am inclined to believe that
Manning designed these Crown stamps at Mr. Raymond's instigation.
There are no Post Office records relating to the submission and approval
of proofs from the sixpenny plate, but the new stamps were duly gazetted in
the following notice :—

" COLONIAL SECRETARY'S OFFICE, SYDNEY,
"30/A April, 1852.

"POSTAGE STAMPS.

"His Excellency the Governor-General directs it to be notified, that in
pursuance of the provisions of the 1501 clause of the Act of the Governor and
Council, «5th Victoria, No. 12, intituled, 'An Act to consolidate and amend the Law
for Conveyance and Postage of Letters] a plate has been approved for sixpenny stamps,
of the same design as the penny and twopenny stamp now in use.

" Sixpenny stamps with this design will be immediately issued.
" By His Excellency's command,
"E. DEAS THOMSON."

Dr. Houison gives the date on which this stamp was gazetted as 8th May.
As in all cases the Laureated stamps were issued on the date of the public
notice, the date of this value may safely be altered to $oth April.
It is worthy of note that the recommendation of Mr. Merewether, that
the word " Sixpence " should be in strongly marked characters, was faithfully
carried out by the engraver.

On the 1st May, 1852, Mr. Merewether was appointed Auditor-General,
and Major W. H. Christie succeeded him as Postmaster-General.

The urgently required sixpenny stamp having been provided, it might
naturally have been concluded that the engraver would at once fall to and
complete the threepenny plate, which was originally to have been ready by
the joth June, 1851. However, this was not the case, for nothing further was
heard of the plate until the 2Qth September, 1852, when the Colonial
Secretary made inquiries when it would be ready. Major Christie, in reply,
stated that the engraver had promised that the plate would be completed by
the loth of October. Evidently the Major was not acquainted with Mr.
Carmichael's little idiosyncrasies, otherwise he would have been more guarded
in accepting his assurances. The loth of October came and went, but the
long-promised threepenny plate was still incomplete. The Colonial Secretary
again wrote on the fourteenth of that month, asking when the plate
would be forthcoming. Major Christie appears to have tried to stir Carmichael
up to a sense of his duty, but without avail, for on the 25th October
he had to write to the Colonial Secretary, informing him that the plate for
the threepenny postage stamps was not yet completed, but the engraver had
now promised it by the 1st of November. The Major added that these
annoying delays had not occurred from neglect in the Post Office.
Carmichael's promise again proved to be of the piecrust order, and it was
not until the 27th November that a proof from the plate was submitted for
approval. The Governor gave his approval on the ist December, and the
issue of stamps was gazetted as follows:—

" COLONIAL SECRETARY'S OFFICE, SYDNEY,
" 2nd December, 1852.
"POSTAGE STAMPS.

" His Excellency the Governor-General directs it to be notified, that in pursuance
of the provisions of the isth clause of the Act of the Governor and Council,
15th Viet., No. 12, intituled, 'An Act to consolidate and amend the Law for
Conveyance and Postage of Letters,' a new plate has been provided for threepenny
stamps of the same design as the penny, twopenny, and sixpenny stamps now in use.
" Threepenny stamps with this design will be immediately issued.

" By His Excellency's command,
"E. DEAS THOMSON."

On the 3rd December, 1852, Major Christie forwarded duplicate sheets of
the threepenny postage stamps which had just been struck off from the new
plate for transmission to England. This was done in connection with the
proposal to obtain a supply of "threaded" or watermarked paper from
England, hereinafter referred to.

\section{The Eightpence}

The remaining value of the series, the eightpence, is referred to only in
the following letter, there being no other records to be found in the Post
Office :—

"GENERAL POST OFFICE, \$th January, 1853.

" SIR,—Referring to the notice of the 24th ultimo, respecting the prepayment of
letters to the United Kingdom, I have the honour to bring under the notice of the
Governor-General the expediency of having an eightpenny stamp for issue to the
public, this being the rate of postage on letters by private ship.

" 2. This stamp is also desirable for the quadruple postage on inland letters, and
will thus relieve the great pressure on the twopenny stamps.

"3. I beg, therefore, to recommend that I may be authorised to obtain a copper
plate containing fifty labels of the value indicated for immediate use, at a cost not
exceeding £26 53., to be charged against the sum voted for providing and repairing
postage stamp plates, and that a steel plate containing 100 labels may be ordered
from England. " I have, etc.,

"W. H. CHRISTIE."

Carmichael had apparently forfeited all claim to consideration, owing to
his dilatoriness, and the work of engraving the eightpenny plate was entrusted
to H. C. Jervis, the engraver of the threepenny "View." The plate
was ready on the 13th May, and the issue of stamps was gazetted as
follows:—

\begin{blockquote}[shadow]

\opening{COLONIAL SECRETARY'S OFFICE, SYDNEY,}
\openingdate{16th May, 1853.}

\heading{POSTAGE STAMPS.}

His Excellency the Governor-General directs it to be notified, that in pursuance
of the provisions of the isth clause of the Act of the Governor and Council,
15th Victoria, No. 12, intituled, 'An Act to consolidate and amend the Law for
Conveyance and Postage of Letters,' a plate has been provided for eightpenny stamps
of the same design as the other postage stamps now in use.

" Eightpenny stamps with this design will be immediately issued.

\closing{By His Excellency's command,}
\closing{E. DEAS THOMSON.}

\end{blockquote}

The series of Laureated stamps having been completed so far as it was
then intended to furnish them, the following notice was published in the
Gazette:—

" GENERAL POST OFFICE, SYDNEY,
"4tAJufy, 1853.
"POSTAGE STAMPS.

" Notice is hereby given that stamps of the undermentioned values can now be
procured at the General and all country post offices, as well as at the several suboffices
and receiving offices, viz. :—

" One penny postage stamps
Twopenny ,,
Threepenny „
Sixpenny „
Eightpenny

" Plates for fivepenny and 'one shilling stamps have been ordered from England,
and will be issued on their arrival in the Colony.

" VV. H. CHRISTIE, Postmaster-General."

The twopenny steel plate had been in use just two years, when the
Inspector of Stamps found it necessary to report to the Chief Secretary that
it had become so worn from constant use that it would shortly be necessary
to have it repaired. In reply to this communication the Colonial Secretary
wrote, under date 8th August, 1853 :—

\begin{blockquote}[shadow]

"SIR,---I do myself the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the
28th ultimo, No. 53/29, reporting that the steel plate for printing twopenny postage
stamps has become from constant use so worn that it will shortly be necessary to
have it repaired, and in reply I am directed to inform you that under the circumstances
represented in your communication, His Excellency the Governor-General
approves of your employing Mr. H. C. Jervis to engrave a new copper twopenny
plate, as nearly similar as possible to the steel plate now in use, at an expense of ^40,
and also to repair the steel plate for the sum of £40, to be charged against the
amount voted for this service in the contingencies of the Stamp Department.

\closing{I have, etc., for the Colonial Secretary,}
\closing{"W. ELYARD, JUN.}
\end{blockquote}

On the same date Mr. Elyard wrote to the Postmaster-General, enclosing
a copy of the foregoing letter.

I have found no further records relating to this copper plate twopenny
stamp, which, as is well known, was the variety with six-rayed stars in the
angles. Nor have I been able to find any further reference to the retouching
of the twopenny steel plate, referred to in the foregoing letter, nor to the
retouching of the sixpenny plate, which doubtless was effected about this
time by Jervis.

On the nth June, 1852, Major Christie wrote to the Colonial Secretary a
letter with reference to procuring postage stamp plates and paper from
England. The following paragraphs, which relate to the paper for the
Laureated series, are quoted :—

"I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated zsth ultimo,
No. 52/74, informing me that His Excellency the Governor-General has been pleased to
approve of the suggestions contained in my predecessor's letter of the 3oth April last,
No. 56, for procuring plates, papers, etc., for postage stamps from England. . . .
" 4. I beg also to transmit duplicate sheets of the one penny and twopenny stamps
to be forwarded to England, together with two copies of the estimates annexed to my
predecessor's letter of the postage stamps required to meet the demand for two years,
and of the cost of providing the books, colours, etc., to be procured from England.
"5. So soon as the threepenny stamps now being engraved by Mr. Carmichael
are struck off, I shall not fail to transmit duplicate sheets to be forwarded to
Mr. Barnard. The designs for these stamps have already been approved of in your
letter, No. 50/200, dated 2ist November, 1850."

As we have already seen, the duplicate sheets of the threepenny stamps
were forwarded for transmission to England on the 3rd December, 1852.
On the 3Oth January, 1854, in notifying the issue of the new sixpenny
and one shilling stamps (large square design), the Colonial Secretary
announced:—

" It is further notified that for the future all stamps will bear a watermark on each
label of the value indicated by each respective stamp, with the exception of the
eightpenny, the new paper for which has not yet arrived from England."
As the notice above referred to provided for the supersession of the
sixpenny of the Laureated series, the only stamps of that series to which the
notice relating to watermarks could refer were the one penny, two pence
(Plate I., retouched), and three pence.

In order that collectors may learn how narrowly they escaped having to
provide space for another value of the Laureated series I will quote the
following correspondence.

In a letter dated 3Oth April, 1852, Mr. Merewether said :—

"4. I recommend that plates for sixpenny and one shilling stamps, engraved
on steel and with elaborate workmanship, so as to give security against forgery,
should be forwarded from England."

And on the i2th May, 1852, his successor, Major Christie, wrote:—
"Referring to the letter from this office of the 3oth April, No. 52/56, in which it
is proposed that a plate for shilling stamps should be obtained from England, I have
the honour to inform you that in consequence of representations which have been
made to me of the difficulty of affixing a sufficient number of the stamps now in use
on parcels passing through the post, I consider it necessary that shilling postage
stamps should be issued as soon as practicable.

" 2. Mr. Carmichael, by whom the other plates have been engraved, will execute
the one now required on copper, of the same pattern as the sixpenny stamps, with the
necessary substitution of the words ' One Shilling' in strongly marked characters, for
£20, being at the rate of i6s. a label, the plate to contain 25 labels.
"3. The cost of this plate can be charged against the sum of ^100, which was
voted by the Legislative Council for providing and renewing plates for postage stamps
during the present year."

That the Governor-General did not think the locally engraved stamp
would be sufficiently protected against the danger of imitation is shown
by the following letter, addressed by Major Christie to the Colonial
Secretary:—

"GENERAL POST OFFICE, zyth May, 1852.

" SIR,—I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 26th
instant, No. 52/77, in reply to mine of the I2th instant, in which it is stated that His
Excellency the Governor-General does not consider it expedient that a plate for one
shilling stamps should be ordered in this Colony, as it is considered that forgery would
be encouraged if stone* plates of this value were engraved similar to those already
in use for stamps of lesser value.

" 2. I beg to state that the proposal made in my letter of the i2th instant was for
a steel plate,* and that Mr. Carmichael, who has already engraved the sixpence and
the other stamps, is probably the only person in the Colony who could execute these.

"3. For engraving on copper plate Mr. Carmichael's charge is i6s. each Queen's
head; for engraving on steel, which is afterwards hardened and is therefore more
durable, the charge is £1 per Queen's head.

"4. As it will probably be a twelvemonth before the plate from England can
arrive, and the demand for stamps of greater value than 6d. has become great and
urgent in consequence of the numerous packets of gold that pass through the Post
Office daily, I am induced to request that His Excellency will be pleased to reconsider
his decision, the more so as-1 doubt not that Mr. Carmichael would make no extra
charge for an alteration in the shape of the stamp, and in the design itself, that would
obviate any possibility of the stamps of lesser value being used, even if the difference
of the colouring did not obviate this objection."

This appeal, however, was in vain, and nearly two years elapsed before
New South Wales possessed a shilling stamp.
