These envelopes and letter sheets were the World's first Postage Paid Stationery, predating the Mulready stationery by nearly two years. Photo.'Hill's proposals were first put into effect … in Australia when in 1838 James Raymond, the Postmaster General at Sydney, New South Wales, persuaded the government to authorise the issues of stamped letter sheets, wrappers and envelopes bearing the seal of the colony embossed in relief - predating the Mulready letter sheets and envelopes by nearly 2 years. …Members of the public could supply their own paper for stamping. … the first stamping-to-order facility for postal paper, a service which was also contained in Hill's proposals, but not made available in the UK until October 1855.'
