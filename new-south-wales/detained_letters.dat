GAZETTE; Very fine complete 7 Dec. 1849 11-page "New South Wales Government Gazette" (folds to fit album page) with detailed 30 Nov. 1849 G.P.O. Sydney Notice giving a "LIST of Letters 70 in all detained in consequence of the sea postage required thereon not having been paid..." mostly being G.B. addresses (incl. Derby!) but including some in Hong Kong, San Francisco, Calcutta & Cape Town. Clear evidence that Sydney P.O. needed their "DETAINED/FOR POSTAGE" mark as much as London did. Rare early Sydney P.O.
