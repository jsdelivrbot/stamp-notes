\chapter{1854-59 Large Diadems}    

THIS issue is generally known to philatelists as the " Diadems,"
the Queen's head being surmounted by a diadem instead of
being wreathed with laurel as in the [laureted issues](1851-52_The_Laureated_Issues).

The dies and plates for printing this issue were prepared in
London by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon \& Co. from original sketches made in the
CoJony by Mr. T. W. Levinge. The finished drawings were made in London by
Mr. Edward Henry Corbould, drawing-master to the Royal Family. The engraving
of the steel dies was done by Mr. William Humphreys. The plates
were of steel, made in the usual way by rolling in the separate designs while the
plate was in a soft condition. The plate was then touched up by the engraver,
who had to remove all the burring-up at the edges of the designs caused by
the rocking in process ; in doing this sometimes the graver cut a little too deep,
thus causing gutter marks between the stamps. The plate was then hardened
and was ready for use.

The plates for the large square stamps had 100 subjects upon them, and for
the smaller stamps 120 subjects ; these were arranged in ten rows of 12. The
1d. and 2d. values are close imitations of the Early English stamps of the same
value, both as regards the details of the design and the colours. The id. being
red and the 2d. blue. All the values, viz. 1d., 2d., 3d., 5d., 6d., 8d., and I/-,
were at first issued imperforate, and later they were perforated ii|-i2.

\section{Proofs and Colour Trials.}

A large number of proofs are known of the lower values, these are in many
shades of colour and on different kinds of paper. The label over the head is usually blank; 
there is no value, and the left-hand bottom corner has been
voided or cut off. They were printed from trial plates of six designs.\cite{Ginger, 0464 pdf}

The 6d. is also known in many colours, and, in some, one corner has been
voided. These were printed from small trial blocks of four designs. Black die
proofs are also known of all the values, including 5/-, many on India paper,
and some on stiff card.

The 5d., 8d., i/- and 5/- are also known in many shades and colours,
and the 8d. blue is known to have passed through the post. I show a selection
of the above, and also a few reprints ; these latter are on paper watermarked
N.S.W., and in some cases have the word " Cancelled " printed on them.

The first plates made were for the 6d. and 1/- values in the large square
design, each having 100 subjects. These were sent out to the Colony in July
1853, along with a printing press, a supply of special paper, pigments, etc. The
stamps were issued for use February 1854. The diversity of the shades of colour
in the case of the 6d. is very great and shows that the printing staff at Sydney were
very inexperienced in the mixing of colours. Early in 1864 the 6d. plate showed
signs of wear and a new plate was ordered from London, to again have 100 designs
and to be made from the same original die. 

This new plate was sent out in
October 1864. In 1857 the 1/- plate was damaged by over-heating, but the
damage does not appear to have been very great, as it continued in use for many
years.

Plates for the 5d. and 8d. values were sent to the Colony in January 1855.
The local authorities were much displeased when they found that these plates
had been prepared with designs the same size as the 6d. and i/-, and an attempt
was made to get them substituted by new plates giving smaller size designs.
The Governor-General, however, decided to accept them, and stamps printed
from them were issued in December 1855. The four values, 5d., 6d., 8d., and i/-,
were all printed on paper watermarked with large double-line numerals ; the size
of these numerals varies very considerably.

The 6d. watermark 8. In July 1859 the paper watermark 6 was all used up,
and paper watermark 8 was used pending the arrival from England of a further
supply of paper watermark 6. 175,000 6d. stamps were printed on this paper
watermark 8, a number of which were supplied to Queensland.
The stamps on this paper are in two distinct shades, viz. pale greenish grey
and pale greyish brown.

The I/- watermark 8. In May 1857 the stock of paper watermark 12 was
exhausted, and paper watermark 8 was used for a short time, viz. from June 20th
to October 5th, 1857. The total number of i/- stamps imperf. and watermark 12
was 439,900. The number watermark 8 was 25,000. In the i/- imperf. as in the
66.., there was a great diversity in the shades. They have been roughly divided
into rosy vermilion, pale red, and brownish red.

The 5d. was first issued on December ist, 1855, and the total number printed
imperf. was 28,400, of which only 9,900 were used. This value is found in two
distinct shades, viz. yellowish green and deep full green. Of the 8d. imperf.
52,000 imperf. were printed, and these are found in three distinct shades, viz.
golden yellow, pale yellow, and dull orange.

\section{The 1d. and 3d. Values}

The id. value was first issued in April 1856, and the total number of the
imperf. stamps printed was 4,356,720. There are many shades of colour, the first
being in bright orange-vermilion, printed from over-inked and badly wiped
plates. Later, the colour was carmine-vermilion to scarlet and finally dull shades
of brick-red and red-orange. All were watermarked double line 1. The first
printing from the 3d. value was in September 1856, but they were not issued
until October loth. The total number of imperf. stamps was 215,000 ; again
there were many shades, beginning with deep yellow-green from over-inked and
badly wiped plates and ranging through various shades of green ; these were
watermarked 3.

The 3d. watermark 2. An error of watermark, viz. watermark 2 is known,
but this is so very rare that it is thought only one or two sheets were printed,
and that these got mixed with the watermark 3 sheets by some oversight.
The three plates for the id., 2d., and 3d. stamps were all made with 120
subjects upon them, viz. ten rows of 12 equal 120.

The 3d. and 5d. Diadems had a very long lease of life, and it is said that the
5d. holds the record for the longest service of any design for any postage stamp,
the same plate being in use for about sixty years without retouch or renewal.
