Description: Proofs of the Adopted Designs: Imperforate colour trial blocks of 4 on ungummed unwatermarked paper, all different colours comprising 1d (4), 2d (4), 4d (4), 6d (5), 8d (4), 1/- (4), 5/- (4) 
\& 20/- (4), all with good to large margins. 
In 1988 Rodney Perry offered by private treaty ("Price on Application") a largely complete set of 57 of the 65 possible colours all in blocks of 4. Several of the blocks included here can be traced to that offering and our vendor has confirmed that they are all from that source, as are the blocks in the next lot. 
Richard Breckon, writing in "The Australian Philatelist" of June 1988, referred to the Perry blocks stating "at least one set exists in blocks of 4". We are not aware of any others. (Qty 33 blocks)
Estimate: AUD$ 30000.00.}
