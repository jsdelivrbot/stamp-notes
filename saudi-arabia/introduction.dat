\chapter{Saudi Arabia}  

The pedestrian list of Saudi Arabia in the Gibbons catalogue gives no indication of the
fascinating and complicated background of the present kingdom and to understand fully
the postal issues with their multitude of subjects, overprints and currencies, it would be
necessary first to review the nation's historical beginnings and development. The history of
modern Saudi Arabia can be related to the birth of Muhammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab in 1704. Much
earlier, of course, the old Arabian Empire had fragmented and most of the Middle East
had been taken over by the Ottoman Turks who had made Istanboul their capital. 

With
the disintegration of empire had come a decay in the practice of the Islamic faith and its
tenets. Shaykh Wahab became a religious leader of deep convictions and started a revival
movement, puritanical in nature, and was accordingly persecuted like most reformers.
He found refuge in central Arabia with Shaykh Moh'd Ibn Saud of Nejd where his teachings
appealed to the tough ascetic Bedouin groups and he developed a fanatic following.
These followers, known as Wahabis, under the banner of the House of Saud expanded the
movement by force of arms and by the early 19th century were in physical if not spiritual
control of most of the Arabian peninsula, including the Hejaz and Oman. This period
produced the first Saudi Arabian kingdom.

Naturally, this political situation was unacceptable to the Ottoman Empire and, after
several campaigns, the Wahabis were finally defeated by Moh'd Ali, Viceroy of Egypt, in
1817 and the Hejaz territory was reduced to a Turkish province under Cairo control.
Civil wars between the Saudi and Rashidi families balkanized the rest of the old Wahabi
kingdom. In 1845, jurisdiction of the Hejaz was transferred to Istanboul but actual local
authority was delegated to the Amirate of Mecca. In 1871 the Turks occupied the eastern
al-Hasa area along the Gulf and maintained an uneasy presence in central Arabia. However,
the Saudi family with their Wahabi shock troops slowly staged a comeback and had
reconquered most of Nejd, including Riyadh, by 1910.

A third powerful Arab family was introduced when Istanboul appointed the Hashimite
Sheikh Hussain as Grand Sherif of Mecca in 1910, who soon mounted several unsuccessful
punitive expeditions against the Saudi Nejd. The status quo changed in June, 1917 when,
with British support, Sherif Hussain raised the flag of the 'Revolt in the Desert' which
resulted in the expulsion of the Turks from most of their holdings in Arabia as well as the
issuance of the first Mecca postage stamps. Hussain was subsequently recognized by the
Allied forces as king of an independent Hejaz State and two of his sons, Faysal and Abdullah,
later became the kings of Iraq and Jordan respectively. Turkish forces finally evacuated
Madina and Yenbo shortly before the Hejaz Kingdom became a charter member of
the League of Nations in 1919.




To recapitulate, the present territory of Saudi Arabia in 1920 contained the Hashimite
Kingdom of the Hejaz, the Rashidi Shaykhdom of Shammar, the Saudi Amirate of Nejd,
their various dependencies, the semi-autonomous 'Asir and Wadi as-Sirhan regions and
miscellaneous pieces of desert. However, by the end of 1922, Wahabi forces had extended
Saudi sovereignty to the indefinite borders of the Hejaz and the Nejdi Amirate had been
upgraded to a Sultanate.

Continuing border forays led to open warfare in mid-1924 following King Hussain's
action in proclaiming himself as 'Caliph, Prince of the Faithful and Successor to the
Prophet' and indicated the same by overprinting the Hejaz postage stamps. Mecca, the
Hejazi capital, was evacuated under Saudi pressure and the Hashimite government fled to
the main seaport, Jeddah, where Hussain abdicated in favour of his oldest son, Ali, on
4th October and the Arabic equivalent of this date was overprinted on all later stamp
issues of the Hejaz Government, until the final capitulation in December, 1925.* It should
be noted that prior to the fall of Jeddah, British forces occupied the Hejazi towns of Ma'an
and Aqabah to insure that the Hashimite Kingdom of the Jordan would have access to
international waters!

Standardized bilingual circular postmark introduced about 1901 and continued in use by succeeding
governments until early 1930s.

Following the Hashimite surrender, the Nejdi Sultan Abdul Aziz al-Saud accepted the
additional title of King of the Hejaz and some twelve months later he was proclaimed
King of the Hejaz and of Nejd, and ruled over the dual kingdom until it was consolidated
in September, 1932 as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. From the above it can be seen that,
disregarding the Ottoman stamps used in various parts of Arabia during Turkish suzerainty,
the catalogue listings for Saudi Arabia actually combine those stamps issued by five different
political entities since 1916, namely: the Sherifate of Mecca and its Dominions; the
Kingdom of the Hejaz; the Sultanate of Nejd and its Dependencies; the dual Kingdom of
the Hejaz and Nejd; and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.


These several stamp-issuing administrations employed different monetary systems.
The Sherifate of Mecca stamps were sold for Turkish coinage: 40 para= 1 guersh (kurush/
piaster); 100 guersh=l majidi (Turkish gold pound). The Hejaz Government joined the
sterling area and issued its own coins including a gold sovereign. The Maria Theresa silver
thaler was also in common use. The Nejdi Sultanate continued to use the Turkish majidi
coinage until the succeeding dual kingdom set up its own monetary system in 1928 of:
11 royal guersh =1 Saudi riyal (equal to the Maria Theresa thaler); 10 Saudi riyals=l gold
guinea. Devaluation led to a modification: 22 common guersh=ll royal guersh=l Saudi
riyal; 40 riyals=l gold sovereign, but the stamps continued to be sold for royal guersh.
In 1960, anticipating Britain by eleven years, the money was decimalised to: 100 halala=
20 common guersh =1 Saudi riyal. The new 1960 definitive stamp issues were therefore
denominated in the common guersh, and the postal rates revised, but the older stamps
priced in royal guersh were accepted for postage at double face. So while a rose may be a
rose, a guersh was not necessarily a guerche nor a qirsh although pronounced the same.

\section{The Ottoman Regular Post}
The first regular posts were maintained by the Ottoman Empire until 1916 using
ordinary Turkish stamps. These forerunners can only be identified by the postal markings
and examples are not common.* According to the UPU, the Turkish Post at the turn of the
century had offices in the present Kingdom at Jeddah, Mecca, Madina, Taif, Quinfuda,
Nejd, Hasa and Qatif. Offices were later opened at Wejd, Yenbo Radhwa and elsewhere.
The first stamps for the Sherifate of Mecca were produced by the Survey of Egypt as a
courtesy to a new ally. They were placed in use only a few short months after the June, 1916
Declaration of Independence and can be considered examples of psychologic warfare
against Turkey. The initial release of the 1 guersh value, from a limited printing in pale
blue of only 2,000, was made in mid-August and many copies were presented to important
Arab and British officials and to learned institutions. A Society member must have been
on Allenby's staff for a part sheet of thirty-five of this historic stamp was sent to the Royal!*

Five more denominations were subsequently issued, all of pleasant Arabesque design with
a unifying central inscription reading 'Mecca the Honoured', and the entire series went
through many printings until replaced in 1922. For those interested in all details of these
definitives, a superb colour-illustrated monograph is recommended, entitled: A Short Note
on the Design and Issue of Postage Stamps prepared by the Survey of Egypt for H. H. Hussain,
Emir, Sherif of Mecca, King of the Hejaz.

To belatedly show the change in sovereignty status, the Mecca stamps were typographically
overprinted The Hashimite Arabian Government' with flanking year dates and issued in December, 1921. The non-geographic political term used allowed for possible future
territorial expansion. Only 3,000 complete sets of these 'provisional' provisional were
prepared and they were superceded a month later by stamps with a similarly inscribed but
framed overprint produced in quantity from a litho plate. In February, 1922 a new definitive
series was introduced, duly inscribed at the top of a crowded design featuring the Sherifian
arms with 'The Hashimite Arabian Government'. These stamps were typographed in Mecca
on several types of paper from rather coarse plates and went through several printings
which produced a wide range of shades and minor plate varieties. A bi-colour ten guersh
value was added sometime later which has provided many examples of inverted centres
due, undoubtedly, to the visual difficulty of determining which end of the dark crowded
design should be upermost!

A gilt-powder on black ink overprint was made on the definitive series in March, 1924 to
commemorate the assumption of the Caliphate by King Hussein which action, as noted
previously, helped to trigger off the subsequent Hejazi-Nejd war. Battle reverses led to the
evacuation of Mecca and the Hejaz officials, taking with them a limited supply of obsolete
and current stamps in varying condition hastily collected from the Treasury vaults, fled
to Jeddah in late September. Here the stamps, to become known as the Jeddah Provisionals,
were given two- or three-line control overprints reading more realistically 'The Hejazi
Government 4 October 1924', the date being that of the accession of King Ali to the shaky
throne. The overprinting was done on a hand-to-mouth basis at a local commercial press
by an indifferent printer with an inexperienced crew under siege conditions. Part sheets
and odd lots had to be reassembled to fit the layout of the typo plates. Many sheets of the
obsolete were stuck together and had to be separated. When this was not practical, the
sheets were overprinted on both sides.* Mrs Warin in her excellent book entitled The Postal
Issues of Hejaz, Jeddah and Nejd (published by the well-known dealer, David Field) gives
a vivid description of the chaotic conditions at the printing shop. The result of course was
the production of a fascinating array of legitimate inverts, doubles, shifts, printed-on-backs
and similar varieties. In some cases the errors are more common than the normal overprints.

Actually, because of the limited stock of the basic stamp, less than 500 copies were issued
of many of the Jeddah Provisionals and their relatively low catalogue price does not reflect
their true scarcity. Hence forged overprints exist.
With Jeddah encircled and Saudi Wahabi forces in occupation of most of the Hejaz,
the Sultanate elected to maintain and expand the existing postal system. However, it never
did issue any of its own definitives depending entirely on provisionals made by overprinting
stamp stocks captured in Mecca and elsewhere. These provided an assortment of old
Turkish remainders, obsolete and current Hejaz definitives and provisionals, proof sheets,
colour trials, essays and various Hejaz tax items. A mixed bag of these was first released
in Mecca in March, 1925 with a dated validation overprint handstamped in various colours,
reading 'Posts of the Nejdi Sultanate - 1343'. Quantities ranged from 750 to 5,000.
The religious aspect of the war was reflected on 1 st July when 800 sets of overprinted and
surcharged stamps were released to commemorate the first annual pilgrimage to Holy
Mecca under the protection of the Nejdi Sultanate. The second Nejdi provisional issue,
again utilising a varied collection of basic stamp material, began appearing in early August
handstamped in several colours with a revised upcurving undated overprint reading
'Posts of the Nejdi Sultanate'. Included were two low values also overprinted 'Matbua'
(Printed Matter) but since less than 200 copies were issued and this number would be
insufficient to post one mailing of newspapers, the basic adhesives were undoubtedly
Hejazi essays. The few used copies seen have all been on envelopes. It should be noted that,
although all the above provisionals were handstamped, the work was carefully done and
relatively few errors have been recorded.

During this same period the Hejaz Government, besieged in Jeddah, had asked the Survey
of Egypt to prepare quickly a new definitive set for the King Ali regime. Early delivery
could not be promised so the contract was given in May, 1925 to the private Mourafatti
Press in Cairo. Printing security was lax and serious leakages occurred before delivery so
the new stamps, realistically inscribed 'The Arabian Hejazi Government' were overprinted
before release with a control consisting of two dated tablets. This simple security action
unwittingly produced a multitude of new major varieties. The overprinting was made in
black, red or blue ink with the tablets reading either up or down. Three overprintings were
made, each from different plates, of which two were applied in Jeddah and the final one
in Cairo, so it is possible to find up to eighteen major varieties of most of the nine denominations.

For reasons unexplained, the Cairo overprints were added by the same printing
firm whose carelessness made the controls necessary in the first place!

Some of these last definitives of Hejaz and several revenues are known further handstamped
in two lines 'The Saudi Nejdi Sultanate'. Although not listed by Warin or Gibbons,
these provisionals may well have originated in Madina after its capitulation in early
December, 1925. The final Sultanate issues consisted of two surcharged sets of 1,800 each,
overprinted to commemorate the respective captures of Madina and Jeddah. Whether these
were issued before or after such events is still uncertain. 

THE ensuing dual kingdom moved rapidly to introduce its own definitives and the first
set, inscribed 'Posts of the Hejaz and Nejd', appeared in February, 1926. This emergency
issue of only 2,000 sets, probably printed in Cairo, was soon replaced in March by a series
of similar design but in changed colours. This was followed later in the year by a new series
inscribed 'The Arabian Government' at the top and 'Posts of the Hejaz and Nejd' at the
bottom. New designs were introduced from 1929 through 1932 with denominations adjusted
to the new Saudi coinage.
The united Kingdom of Saudi Arabia utilised the dual kingdom stamps until January,
1934 when a long set was issued to commemorate the naming of Emir Saud as Heir Apparent
to the Saudi throne. The higher values are denominated in English in terms of a sovereign
but equivalent Arabic reads 'guinea'! Later in 1934 a permanent definitive series was
introduced with a rather plain design featuring the toughra of King Abdul Aziz. Denominated
in royal guersh, the series remained in use for twenty-six years and went through many
printings with resulting distinguishing variations in colours, papers and perforation. The
two high values, released in 1942, were provided at the request of the Arabian American
Oil Company to frank heavy business parcels being airmailed to California. Between 1945
and 1960 various short commemorative sets, printed in Mecca, were routinely issued
mostly in honour of visiting heads of state. The 1952 set celebrating the inauguration of
the national railroad between Port Dammam and the capital, Riyadh, is the only exception.
The stamps were ordered through the oil company, which had been associated with the
project, and the contract was placed with the American Bank Note company. For the
first time living beings were depicted on Saudi stamps! From 1960 through 1962 the commemoratives,
mostly orientated to Arab League affairs, were produced by the Egyptian
State Press. In 1963 the contract for such stamps was transferred to the Esfahani Press in
Jeddah and watermarked paper was introduced with a negative design of a palm tree over
crossed swords. De La Rue took over the printing work in mid-1965 and produced the
stamps in Britain on unwatermarked paper. A new type of watermarked paper appeared in
mid-1968 when the government resumed printing its own stamps at its new press in Riyadh.

Decimalisation in 1960 shortly produced several new definitive issues, denominated in
common guersh, and these form a fascinating group. It is doubtful if any dealer can supply
all denominations of the six different printings made between 1960 and 1970! The initial
definitive sets consisted of sixteeen values depicting the Wadi Hanifa Dam near Riyadh,
sixteen values showing spheroids at a GOSP (Gas-Oil Separating Plant) and fifteen values
for airmail showing a Convair. All designs carry a cartouche containing the name of King
Saud. These forty-seven stamps were produced in sheets of 100 by photogravure on yellow
gummed unwatermarked paper by the Egyptian State Press. The Yemeni civil war caused
political relations between the two governments to deteriorate so when, in 1962, Saudi
Arabia requisitioned additional stamp supplies it was advised by Egypt that the State
Press was too busy to handle work and the photogravure plates were returned to Arabia.

To meet postal needs these plates were turned over to a printer, still unidentified, who
produced five values of the Dam design, nine values of the GOSP design and six values of
the airmails on a thin watermarked paper with white gum. Emergency arrangements were
also made with the Esfahani Press in Jeddah to supply some of the commoner values. Lacking
the original plates, this company had to prepare new plates from which six values in
slightly larger size were printed in sheets of fifty on watermarked paper. Meanwhile, more
permanent arrangements were made with De La Rue to do the stamp printings, and they
prepared 100 new subject plates of slightly smaller format to fit their own equipment. The
Convair on the airmails was updated to a Boeing 720-B jet. The contract called for twentynine
values of each definitive design and De La Rue lithographed these on unwatermarked
paper, although some have still to be released. Stamps produced by all four printers were in
common use in November, 1964 when King Saud was deposed and his brother, Faysal,
acceeded to the throne.*

Accordingly, De La Rue appropriately revised their plates and in early 1966 assorted
values of the several definitive series began appearing with the name of King Faysal in the
royal cartouche and are still being released. With the completion of a modern security
press at Riyadh in 1968, the De La Rue plates were sent to Saudi Arabia and the final
printings of the Faysal definitives were produced by State personnel on a new type of watermarked
paper.* 

This completes the saga of the 1960-70 definitive issues, produced by five
different printers in three or more different countries as a result of international politics,
incompatible printing methods, a palace revolution and other local factors totally unrelated
to the stamp trade. A new definitive series of duplicating lower values showing various
historical and religious monuments is now being introduced.


Postage due stamps have also been issued since 1917 in conjunction with the regular
stamps by the different regimes and follow the same pattern of production and release.
Their use officially ceased in 1963 but they do not appear to have been employed, at least
in the Eastern Province, since the early 1950s. On the other hand, official stamps were not
introduced until 1939 but did not see much use for many years thereafter. All government
mail for interior delivery is transmitted in official paid imprinted envelopes and stamps
are only employed on international mail. Like the concurrent definitives, the 1960-61
officials were produced in Cairo, but the 1964 replacements were typographed in Mecca,
the 1965 short set was lithographed in Jeddah and the latest issue is being produced in
Riyadh.

Before concluding, the charity tax stamps should be mentioned. These were first introduced
to augment medical funds during the 1934 Yemeni-Saudi war and were continued
in use, with many changes in design, colour, paper and separation until 1964 to help finance
public health programmes. They were known to foreign residents as 'Sucker' stamps because
they carry the French word 'Secours'. Actually, they were documentary tax revenues and
their use was not restricted to postal material.
