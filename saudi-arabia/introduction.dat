\chapter{Saudi Arabia}  

The pedestrian list of Saudi Arabia in the Gibbons catalogue gives no indication of the
fascinating and complicated background of the present kingdom and to understand fully
the postal issues with their multitude of subjects, overprints and currencies, it would be
necessary first to review the nation's historical beginnings and development. The history of
modern Saudi Arabia can be related to the birth of Muhammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab in 1704. Much
earlier, of course, the old Arabian Empire had fragmented and most of the Middle East
had been taken over by the Ottoman Turks who had made Istanboul their capital. 

With
the disintegration of empire had come a decay in the practice of the Islamic faith and its
tenets. Shaykh Wahab became a religious leader of deep convictions and started a revival
movement, puritanical in nature, and was accordingly persecuted like most reformers.
He found refuge in central Arabia with Shaykh Moh'd Ibn Saud of Nejd where his teachings
appealed to the tough ascetic Bedouin groups and he developed a fanatic following.
These followers, known as Wahabis, under the banner of the House of Saud expanded the
movement by force of arms and by the early 19th century were in physical if not spiritual
control of most of the Arabian peninsula, including the Hejaz and Oman. This period
produced the first Saudi Arabian kingdom.

Naturally, this political situation was unacceptable to the Ottoman Empire and, after
several campaigns, the Wahabis were finally defeated by Moh'd Ali, Viceroy of Egypt, in
1817 and the Hejaz territory was reduced to a Turkish province under Cairo control.
Civil wars between the Saudi and Rashidi families balkanized the rest of the old Wahabi
kingdom. In 1845, jurisdiction of the Hejaz was transferred to Istanboul but actual local
authority was delegated to the Amirate of Mecca. In 1871 the Turks occupied the eastern
al-Hasa area along the Gulf and maintained an uneasy presence in central Arabia. However,
the Saudi family with their Wahabi shock troops slowly staged a comeback and had
reconquered most of Nejd, including Riyadh, by 1910.

A third powerful Arab family was introduced when Istanboul appointed the Hashimite
Sheikh Hussain as Grand Sherif of Mecca in 1910, who soon mounted several unsuccessful
punitive expeditions against the Saudi Nejd. The status quo changed in June, 1917 when,
with British support, Sherif Hussain raised the flag of the 'Revolt in the Desert' which
resulted in the expulsion of the Turks from most of their holdings in Arabia as well as the
issuance of the first Mecca postage stamps. Hussain was subsequently recognized by the
Allied forces as king of an independent Hejaz State and two of his sons, Faysal and Abdullah,
later became the kings of Iraq and Jordan respectively. Turkish forces finally evacuated
Madina and Yenbo shortly before the Hejaz Kingdom became a charter member of
the League of Nations in 1919.




To recapitulate, the present territory of Saudi Arabia in 1920 contained the Hashimite
Kingdom of the Hejaz, the Rashidi Shaykhdom of Shammar, the Saudi Amirate of Nejd,
their various dependencies, the semi-autonomous 'Asir and Wadi as-Sirhan regions and
miscellaneous pieces of desert. However, by the end of 1922, Wahabi forces had extended
Saudi sovereignty to the indefinite borders of the Hejaz and the Nejdi Amirate had been
upgraded to a Sultanate.

Continuing border forays led to open warfare in mid-1924 following King Hussain's
action in proclaiming himself as 'Caliph, Prince of the Faithful and Successor to the
Prophet' and indicated the same by overprinting the Hejaz postage stamps. Mecca, the
Hejazi capital, was evacuated under Saudi pressure and the Hashimite government fled to
the main seaport, Jeddah, where Hussain abdicated in favour of his oldest son, Ali, on
4th October and the Arabic equivalent of this date was overprinted on all later stamp
issues of the Hejaz Government, until the final capitulation in December, 1925.* It should
be noted that prior to the fall of Jeddah, British forces occupied the Hejazi towns of Ma'an
and Aqabah to insure that the Hashimite Kingdom of the Jordan would have access to
international waters!

governments until early 1930s.

Following the Hashimite surrender, the Nejdi Sultan Abdul Aziz al-Saud accepted the
additional title of King of the Hejaz and some twelve months later he was proclaimed
King of the Hejaz and of Nejd, and ruled over the dual kingdom until it was consolidated
in September, 1932 as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. From the above it can be seen that,
disregarding the Ottoman stamps used in various parts of Arabia during Turkish suzerainty,
the catalogue listings for Saudi Arabia actually combine those stamps issued by five different
political entities since 1916, namely: the Sherifate of Mecca and its Dominions; the
Kingdom of the Hejaz; the Sultanate of Nejd and its Dependencies; the dual Kingdom of
the Hejaz and Nejd; and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.


These several stamp-issuing administrations employed different monetary systems.
The Sherifate of Mecca stamps were sold for Turkish coinage: 40 para= 1 guersh (kurush/
piaster); 100 guersh=l majidi (Turkish gold pound). The Hejaz Government joined the
sterling area and issued its own coins including a gold sovereign. The Maria Theresa silver
thaler was also in common use. The Nejdi Sultanate continued to use the Turkish majidi
coinage until the succeeding dual kingdom set up its own monetary system in 1928 of:
11 royal guersh =1 Saudi riyal (equal to the Maria Theresa thaler); 10 Saudi riyals=l gold
guinea. Devaluation led to a modification: 22 common guersh=ll royal guersh=l Saudi
riyal; 40 riyals=l gold sovereign, but the stamps continued to be sold for royal guersh.
In 1960, anticipating Britain by eleven years, the money was decimalised to: 100 halala=
20 common guersh =1 Saudi riyal. The new 1960 definitive stamp issues were therefore
denominated in the common guersh, and the postal rates revised, but the older stamps
priced in royal guersh were accepted for postage at double face. So while a rose may be a
rose, a guersh was not necessarily a guerche nor a qirsh although pronounced the same.
