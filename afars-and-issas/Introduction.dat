The Navigation and Commerce issue is a series of key type stamps issued for the colonial territories of France. It was designed by Louis-Eug\`ene Mouchon[1].
The issue uses a standard design featuring allegorical representations of navigation and commerce. The territory name is imprinted in a rectangular cartouche centered at the bottom of the stamp.

In the French colonies, it is the first series of territory-specific postal releases. To add the territory name permitted to end money loss from people buying stamps in low-valued currency colonies and selling or using them in high-valued currency colonies.[2]
It was first released in 1892, with later releases featuring new color schemes. Dates vary by territory, but by 1900 values start appearing surcharged in red or black ink to use the remaining stocks while colonies then used illustrated stamps.
