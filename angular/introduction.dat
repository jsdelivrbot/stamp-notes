\chapter{What you need to Experiment with Angular }


To experiment with AngularJS examples all you need is a web browser and a text
editor (or your favorite IDE). 

But in order to take full advantage of this book we
would recommend installing node.js (http://nodejs.org/) and its npm package
manager with the following modules:


- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

- [Karma runner](http://karma-runner.github.io)

Code examples illustrating interactions with a back-end are making use of a
cloud-hosted MongoDB database (MongoLab) and couchdb. Most examples here can be run through as you study the material.


Meet AngularJS

AngularJS is a client-side MVC framework written in JavaScript. It runs in a web
browser and greatly helps developers to write modern, single-page, AJAX-style
web applications. It is a general purpose framework, but it shines when used to write
CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) type web applications.

\begin{codeblock}
log(angular.version);
\end{codeblock}

The controller is as follows:

<script>
var WorldCtrl = function ($scope) {
$scope.population = 7000;
$scope.countries = [
{name: 'France', population: 63.1},
{name: 'United Kingdom', population: 61.8},
{name: 'Cyprus',population:0.7}
];
};
</script>

\section{Design Concepts}

There is an interesting video on youtube, where the creator of Angular describes the design decisions behind the framework. I recommend you watch it, as it will give you a good background, as to why things are the way they are with Angular.

And the markup fragment looks in the following manner:
