\section{Stamps and postal history of Zambezia}


Although Zambezia was a part of the Portuguese East Africa Colony, the Portuguese government issued separate postage stamps for it starting in 1894, with the standard design depicting King Charles, and likewise in 1898. A provisional issue came in 1902 to reflect changed rates, then after the revolution of 1910 there were several issues overprinted "REPUBLICA".

The postal districts of [Quelimane](../quelimane/introduction) and [Tete](../tete/introduction) were created from parts of Zambezia in about 1913, and then stamps of Mozambique replaced stamps of Zambezia around 1920.
