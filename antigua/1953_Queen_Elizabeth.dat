\chapter{1953 Queen Elizabeth}    
It must also 
be borne in mind that, from time to time, the UPU legislated what the colours of certain stamps 
should be as they relate to a particular rate, e.g. Local rate, Air mail rate, Post Card rate etc. For 
example therefore, if the UPU said that the Air Mail rate stamp must be ‘red’, then the fact that the 
design of that stamp depicted the sea, then the sea must be red, although blue would have been 
the correct colour, regardless of how hideous it may look. In my book, ‘The Stamps of Barbados’, 
which was published in 1989, I set out on pages 188/9 the reasons for the Change of Colour of the 
several denominations, including the 6c and 8c. This became necessary as a result of a revision of 
postal rates in accordance with Article 106 of the Universal Postal Convention, 1947 These colour 
changes were approved by the Crown Agents on behalf of the Postal Authorities on 17 December 
1951 for the King George VI set and it was agreed that new printings of these denomination would 
appear in the new colours, when further stocks were ordered. However, with the sudden death of 
His Majesty King George VI in February 1952, the colour changes were postponed until the Queen 
Elizabeth stamps could be issued. For the benefit of readers, I reproduce below the text of the 
Savingram dated 11 September 1951 sent by His Excellency the Governor of Barbados to the 
Secretary of State for the Colonies.

STAMPS – CHANGE OF COLOUR 
 
As a result of a revision of international postal rates it is necessary in accordance with Article 106 
of the Universal Postal Union Convention, 1947, to change the colours of several of the present 
issue of stamps. 

2. The following changes have been made: 

3c is the unregistered single rate printed paper rate instead of 2c. 

5c is the unregistered postcard rate instead of 4c. 

8c is the unregistered single rate letter rate instead of 6c. 

3. The following changes are suggested: 

(a) The 2c stamp (Green) be changed to blue-green with orange centre. 

(b) The 3c stamp (Brown/Blue Green) be changed to green with black centre, it being understood 
that provided the predominating colour is green the black centre may be black. 

(c) The 4c stamp (Carmine) be changed to orange with black centre. 

(d) The 6c stamp (Blue) be changed to chocolate. 

(e) The 8c stamp (Pale Blue/Purple Brown) be changed to blue with black centre, blue being the 
predominating colour. 

4. You will be aware that there is at present no 5c stamp which will have to be red and I will 
address you further on the subject of a design. 

5. If there are no objections, it would be appreciated if the Crown Agents could be asked to 
arrange that future supplies be in these new colours. 

GOVERNOR.
