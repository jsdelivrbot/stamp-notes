DRAMATIC ACCOUNT OF A THRASHING GIVEN TO THE LOCAL PAPER's EDITOR \& SUBSEQUENT MOB-RIOTS OF NEGROES, ETC. IN SMALL FLEURON COVER TO G.B.; Remarkable and fine 6 June 1831 EL (partly cross-written in red ink) from "Betty's Hope" to Bath "P. Packet" charged "2/1" with a very fine small "ANTIGUA/JU6/1831" small fleuron d.s. nicely placed on the lower flap. The writer gives a long, detailed and alarming account of his recent problems with a disrespectful local newspaper editor (who he thrashed publicly with a horse-whip bought for the purpose!), following his brother's having caught negro arsonists at work in their cane fields, that then led to several riots by mobs of freed slaves intent upon murdering the writer; with the Governor involved, writs flying, warning shots fired, a bottle thrown at the writer, some wounds inflicted by friends' sabres on the Mob, summonses \& writs flying, and the final intervention of the 62nd Regiment. Amazing historical letter from the unrest following the emancipation of the slaves on the island.		Estimated Value: \pound150

Sale: 676
Lot: 548		ANTIGUA
EARLY "ANTIGUA" MARK ON COVER TO G.B. "P. PACKET FROM ST. KITTS" DUE TO FRENCH DISRUPTION OF PACKETS SERVICE; Remarkable 8 May 1797 EL (wax offset-stain affects address but well clear of Antigua mark \& Packet endorsement) from "Antigua" to London with very fine "ANTIGUA" (36x5mm) nicely placed on the front, originally endorsed "p. Packet from St. Kitts" (crossed through upon local redirection in London) charged "1/8" (and then a further "1"[d] for London redirection) having 13 June London arrival backstamps. The contents reveal the reason for the St. Kitts endorsement:- "The unfortunate Capture of our first February Packet, and the loss of all the Letters, and no Account as yet of the second February Mail i the se seas, gives reason to suppose she has shared the same fate as the first Packet of that month, The first February Packet [the Falmouth Packet ship, the 'Swallow'] has been retaken \& carried into St. Kitts, and purchased there by the President, on Behalf of Government, to proceed to England from that Island with letters; therefore I am desirous of taking the chance of a few lines reaching you from this island". Rare postmark and extremely unusual routing and contents. Important Antigua/St. Kitts item.		Estimated Value: \pound300.
