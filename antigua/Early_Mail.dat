\chapter{Early Mails}  
(Reprinted from the Philatelic Journal of Great Britain by kind permission of its

The discovery of another part of the Tudway correspondence from Antigua to Great 
Britain in the nineteenth century gives one the opportunity to make some observations 
on the way mail was carried outside the packet service from the West Indies in the 
nineteenth century. 

"The Codrington Correspondence" showed that the bulk of these letters of the same 
period were sent by packet and only a comparatively few (about 8%) were carried by 
private ship and about three per cent by warships. The Tudway Correspondence. In 
some hundred letters of this period over ninety per cent were carried by private vessels 
and very few by warships. 

As in some cases the writers were the same, one must presume the Codringtons 
instructed their correspondents to send their letters by packet with copies preferably by 
warships or alternatively by private ships. As the postage rate was cheaper by private 
ship, one would expect this to be the popular method in the absence of definite 
instructions. 

Fortunately it was often the custom to write the name of ship and sometimes that of 
the master in the lower left hand corner, so in a run of correspondence one is able to 
trace a number of voyages of one particular ship.

For instance, there are letters carried on six different voyages of the Glaphyra and 
the Jamaica (Capt. Lowell), five different voyages of the Codrington (Capts. Hill and 
Gaynes) and the Kingston (Capt. T. W. Pearson) and three of the Emerald. With names 
like the Kingston and the Jamaica the thought arises that they had the same owner. 
The earliest date noted for a letter carried by the Glaphyra is June 1833 when fifty 
days elapsed between the day when the letter was written and the day the letter passed 
through London. There is no date showing when the ship sailed but in 1834 letters 
dated 22nd August and 19th October by this ship show that she must have made the 
round trip in under sixty days. Of the six voyages which have been noted, the 
Glaphyra left her mail at the ports of Penzance, Portsmouth, Deal and three times at 
Dover. In those days a ship's captain was duty bound to hand his mail into the post 
office where he made his first landfall. Bearing in mind the necessity that may arise for 
fresh provisions and water on such voyages, the popularity of Dover probably lay in the 
fact that the postal service ran several times a day to London and a master could let his 
owners know of his arrival so that nearly a day would elapse before he anchored in the 
Thames and was ready for his cargo to be unloaded. 

The master of the Jamaica had other ideas for between 1826 and 1840 he dropped 
his mail at Plymouth, Southampton, Portsmouth, Eastbourne, Hastings and Deal. One 
letter written in Antigua on 15th April, 1840 passed through London on 19th May and 
only one other letter carried by the Lotus in 1843 provides evidence of a five week 
journey. 

The Kingston, whose first journey is noted in March, 1833, dropped her mail at 
Kingsbridge, Hastings, Deal and twice at Dover.

The Codrington, whose home port was Bristol, usually took her cargo to London, 
for her mail is marked at Bristol on only one occasion, others being Kingsbridge, 
Dover, Deal and Margate. 
 
In looking at the variety of ship letters in the new find and the Codrington 
Correspondence in seventy-eight letters, twelve were landed at Bristol, eleven at Dover, 
eight each at Liverpool and Portsmouth, six at Deal, live at Falmouth, four at Margate, 
three each at Kingsbridge and Plymouth, two each at Folkestone, Hastings, London, 
Seaford for Lewes and Weymouth. There was only one for Brighton, Eastbourne, 
Gravesend, Penzance, Port Glasgow (the only Scot), Romney, Southampton and 
Torquay. This gives one an idea of the comparative rarity of the various ports of this 
period on letters from the West Indies. Of course, letters from Asia, Australia and 
Africa as well as North America would show quite different results. 
 
While most of these trading ships had their home port in London, there were two 
other great ports which had their own merchant fleets serving the West Indies. 
 
Bristol and Liverpool had been the great ports during the period of the slave trade, 
and there had been great rivalry between them. Their ships had made the triangular run, 
first to West Africa for slaves, then to the West Indies where their human cargo was 
sold, and then the last leg home with the molasses, sugar and rum. 
 
From this correspondence one can deduce the following vessels, most barques or 
brigatines, had Bristol owners. The Appollo 1821, the Antigua Planter 1834. A 
Captain Cherry appears as the master of the Hercules 1839. The Thomas Daniele 
(possibly the name of the owner) 1840 and the Lucy 1841-42. There was the Eliza 
(Capt. Harris) 1839, probably the successor of the Frances and Eliza (Capt. Hofman) 
which was covering the same route in the last decade of the eighteenth century. The 
Lotus (Capt. Head) 1843 was another barque and the Codrington (Capt. Gaynes) has 
already been mentioned. 
 
While it was the custom to mention the captain's name on letters carried by the 
Bristol ships, it is rarely found on letters carried by ships of the Liverpool fleet. 
Among the Tudway letters that were carried to this port were the Grace 1829, the 
Deniston 1833-42, the Isabel 1839, the Brigand and the Phoenix 1840. 
 
There are four unusual features on the letters arriving in England that merit 
mention. 
 
A letter dated 20th June 1826 carried on the Codrington was endorsed on arrival at 
Bristol "sea postage 2/-" unusual because this term is normally only found written on 
letters in Asia or Australia to differentiate between land and sea charges. Also the 2/- 
charge was a packet rate and not a ship letter rate. 
 
The mail carried by the Miranda which passed through London on 25th August, 
1836 was landed at the small port of Seaford and then taken by road to Lewes where 
the Ship Letter handstamp was applied. 
 
The letters carried by the Ann Gales which left Antigua in mid-May 1837 were 
erroneously handstamped in red INDIA LETTER PORTSMOUTH. 
 
The letters carried on the packet which left Antigua in mid-October, 1840, arriving in 
London on 28th November, were both marked "Missent to London." This is curious 
as all the other letters carried by packet and addressed to one of the Tudway family at 
Wells, Somerset, also passed through London. 
 
* * * 
 
The sixty-four letters written in the nineteenth century comprise letters from three 
of the successive managers of the Tudway plantations, Parham Old Work and Parham 
Lodge. The first of these was George W. Ottley, whose name appears in "The 
Codrington Correspondence" and while obviously manager of Parham Lodge estate, 
also served the Codringtons in 1807 as attorney. Here are ten more of his letters 
written between 22nd September, 1808 and 18th June, 1835. One letter over his 
signature is enclosed with a letter from his successor. 
 
The second writer was Jno. Freeland and there are eighteen letters between 9th 
March, 1833 and 29th July, 1835. Freeland's letters are numbered from 187 to 235 so 
there are thirty-one missing numbers; perhaps these and the first 186 will turn up later. 
 
The third writer was T. D. Foote from whom there are 37 documents, twenty-six 
are printed forms with full details of the monthly costs and production of one or other 
estates. These give a remarkable and intimate view of a West Indian plantation of the 
period. 
 
* * * 
 
Another interesting aspect of this correspondence is that the twelve letters which 
had bills of lading enclosed still contain the original enclosures. Obviously neither 
Freeland nor Foote knew of the privilege "Consignee's Letter" by which a shipper of 
goods (in this case hogsheads of Muscoradro sugar and puncheons of rum) on a private 
vessel could send his letters relating to the goods carried on that vessel free of postal 
charge. There are six of these letters where the enclosed bills of lading refer to goods 
carried on the vessel which carried the mail. The dates range from 26th April, 1835 to 
31st August, 1841 on the Jamaica (twice), Clorinda, Ann Gales, Glaphyra, Tobago and 
Steadfast. In the Codrington correspondence there were several examples of these 
privilege letters. 
 
From July, 1836 many of the communications were on printed forms "Return of 
Work and Transactions on Parham Old Work (or New Work) Estate" with sections 
showing Wages paid, Canes and Ratoons for Next Crop, Canes and Ratoons cut, Sugar 
Made, Rum Made, Molasses Made, Produce sent from Estate, Articles Received on 
Estate, Live Stock Account, Salaried Servants, Weather during the Month. These 
details and the contents of the letters are another story.
