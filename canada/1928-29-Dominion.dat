\chapter{1928-29 The Dominion Issue}

This series is known to Collectors as the "Scroll" issue. It takes its name from the vignette surrounding the portrait of King george V on the stamps of the lower denominations, but the real reason for this definitive type was the decision that the new issue should commemorate the provinces of Canada. This is the first truly bilingual stamp issue of Canada with the words "Post" and "Postes" forming the pillars of the arch. It is also the first issue to have a booklet with a 5\cent\ stamp.

\section{Booklets}

\ph[99%]{../canada/1928-1cent-booklet.jpg}{}
All the values incorporated into booklets were printed from a configuration of \tete sheets. The six stamps comprising a booklet face each other like a configuration head to toe. Despite the stamps being bilingual there were separte English booklets and French. the booklet covers were simply stapled in both editions.

Stamps for this and the subsequent combination boklet were printed from plates 1 to 360 subjects. The issue date is thought to have been October 29, 1928, same as for the regular over the counter sales. 

The following were issued:

\begin{tabular}{lrr}
                      &English &French\\
1c. four panes of six &99,575 &16,375\\
2c. two panes of six &4,160,000 &328,825\\
1c. (3panes), 2c. (two panes), 5c. (one pane) &50,650 & \\
\end{tabular}

The one cent yellow Scroll stamps were primarily used for mailing greeting cards. 

Complete booklets of a) and b) are comon in English, but scarce in French.

For the imeprforate \tete panes see Plate Proofs above.

All values are found punched O.H.M.S. Stamps overprinted OFFICIAL are bogus.
