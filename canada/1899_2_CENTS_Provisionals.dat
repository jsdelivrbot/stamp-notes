\section{Varieties}

Stamp 48 is known with a small 2 proving that more than one plate was used for the surcharging.

surcharge inverted--- No. 132 and no 133. 

The Post Office Department stated that these errors were illicitly removed from the archives long after the stamp had been withdrawn from use, and thus came into the hands of collectors. 

\section{Forgeries}

There are many forgeries of the issue. Some are crude and others are dangerous. The genuine can be distinguished from the "C" which if joined would make an oval, whereas the forgery, if the upper part is extended downwards, it would pass through the "E". There are also bogus varieties include the double surcharges.
