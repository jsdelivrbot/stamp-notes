\chapter{The Port Hood Provisionals}

The reduction of the postage rate from 3c. to 2c. for inland letters announced on 29th December, effective 1st Jan. 1899, greatly increased the demand for 2 cent stamps. The short notice of the change resulted in a number of P.O.'s running short of 2 cents and having a surplus of 3 cents. Some offices bisected the 3 cents carmine current numeral and these were used against the regulations.

Accoding to Winthrop S. Boggs the Postmaster of Port Hood ran out of 2 cents and bisected and surcharged some 3 cents stamps on 5th Jan. 1899. It is thought that they were bisected as in Figure~\ref{bisected} so that  a strip of  ten would yield five pairs of 1 cent and four pairs of 2 cents; either end of the strip having a single 2c. A "2" was then handstamped over the value on the larger portion and a "1" on the value of the smaller. This method of cutting produced two varieties of each value.

This matter was investigated by Donald A. King, the Postmaster of Halifax who destroyed all the unsold and used copies found. Some covers manufactured in the post office had been sold before the investigation to Stanley Gibbons, who stamped their name on the back of the cover. (See R. Lowe pg. 217).
