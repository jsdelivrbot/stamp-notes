\chapter{The 5c Large Queens}

\section{Die Proofs}

The Brigham collection had a small die proof (\ref{5cdieproof}) in black (lot 298). Notably Robson Lowe (pg 187) noted that die proofs in black exist for all values except the 5c. The proof is probably unique and the auctioneers did not indicate any earlier providence.
