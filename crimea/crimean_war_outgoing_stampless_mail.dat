3/6 Apr. 1854 env. from “Gallipoli” (filing note) to Kent charged “10” with a fair 2-ring “MARSEILLE” c.d.s. (15 Apr.) on
the front. [With note that the contents - no longer present - were headed from “Golden Fleece at anchor off Isle of St.
Angelo”, and included; “It is said that there are to be some mails direct from Marseilles to Constantinople touching at
Gallipoli so perhaps it will be best to direct simply to Gallipoli, Turkey.”] Very early letter from the troops en route to the
Crimea and temporarily held off shore at Gallipoli; clearly sent on the regular Constantinople to Marseilles Packet but
posted in France as an ordinary letter before the Anglo-French postal agreement for Troops’ mail of c.22 May 1854. Fine

million two hundred thousand rounds of ball cartridge...[describing the Queen’s birthday review of the 16,000 infantry

front. Good contents from the ship’s temporary Commander incl. “Lord Raglan has just come...” and “I was glad to see by
an old paper that the postage under ¼oz via Marseilles is only 3d, ½oz 6d, so I may venture a note & if your letters are
directed “H.M.T. 16 Lady Valiant, Constantinople”, I believe I shall receive them at that postage, as I hope you will this...”
