154				MILITARY POSTAL HISTORY
CRIMEAN WAR - UNIQUE(?) BALTIC FLEET COVER - INGOING WITH 10d EMBOSSED & FORWARDED TO G.B. CHARGED "4"; Remarkable fine small July 1854 env. addressed to "H.M.S. MOnarch, Baltic Fleet" franked by a cut-to-shape Embossed 10d Brown tied by the Catterick "133" Numeral, but then redirected back to Stafford with a partial "DANZIG/21/7" c.d.s. and manuscript "4[d]" redirection charge. Exceptional; the ingoing 10d Embossed franking is very rare, and the redirection back to GB with the Danzig c.d.s. makes this a possibly Unique ingoing + outgoing usage. Plus a fine (ILN?) 24 June 1854 newspaper cutting ref. postal arrangements for mail to the Baltic Fleet. Exhibition Item.	&pound;400
