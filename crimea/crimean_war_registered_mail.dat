\caption{869 REGISTERED MAIL - THE UNIQUE PRIVATE SOLDIER’s 1s-5d RATE “Money Letter” COVER TO G.B. VIA
MALTA ENDORSED “Registered” WITH 1d REDS FRANKING; Exceptional small 13 Nov. 1854 env. (overall
dusting and one or two ink marks) to Scotland headed “from No.857 Pt. S. Walk. jr.(?), 93 regt.” above the address
and additionally endorsed “Via Marseilles” and “Money Letter” on the front with a further bold “Registered”
endorsement across the address; Letters containing coin were not allowed under the Concession Rates system and
so the rate for this letter was the full civilian 11d postage + 6d fee rate; there is a part 13 Nov. 1854 blue “POST
OFFICE/[BRITISH ARMY]” c.d.s. (tear) tying the stamps on the reverse, and a partly fine large double-arc
“MALTA” c.d.s. also tying the stamps on the reverse. It was prepaid with no less than 17 GB 1d Red ‘Stars’
cancelled/tied by London “20” transit Numerals, with 5 on the front and a further 12 on the reverse (of which 5 have
been lost - probably torn away when the letter was opened by its addressee) - several have faults but this is one of
only six recorded Registered G.B. covers from the Crimean War and still eminently exhibitable. Thought to be a
Unique rate and franking. PHOTO - see page 23. £300}

\caption{870 REGISTERED MAIL - THE UNIQUE COVER WITH 6d EMBOSSED FRANKING FOR THE 1s-6d RATE
HAVING A RED WAX “POST OFFICE/[Crown]/BRITISH ARMY” BAGSEAL ON THE REVERSE; Astonishing
30 June 1855 env. (part flap lost & minor dusting) to Bristol headed “From Benj. White, No.45 G Division, Master
Tailor” and endorsed “Registered” with partly fine large black “POST OFFICE/BRITISH ARMY” c.d.s. on the
reverse alongside an 80% extremely rare red wax “POST OFFICE/[Crown]BRITISH ARMY” Bagseal (the only
known example?); franked by three cut-to-shape GB Embossed 6d Violets tied (two stamps) or cancelled (the third
stamp which clearly belongs) by fair London transit Numerals along with a matching red 11 July transit backstamp.
Letters containing coin were not allowed under the Concession Rates system (the sender notes - under the flap - that
“I cannot spare more”) and so the rate for this letter was the full civilian 1/- postage + 6d fee rate; this is one of only
six recorded Registered G.B. covers from the Crimean War. Thought to be a Unique franking and the only known
wax Bagseal of the Army P.O.; a highly Important Exhibition Item. £2,000}

FRANKING FOR THE 9d RATE; 4 Oct. 1855 env. (some wear and staining) to London “Via Marseilles” endorsed
“Officer’s Letter” and “Registered” with a very fine small blue “POST OFFICE/C/BRITISH ARMY” c.d.s. (with
the rare ‘Reversed C’ code of Scutari Hospital) on the front, franked by a roughly cut square GB Embossed 6d Violet
and a Strip of Three 1d Red ‘Stars’ (ND-NF; SC14, Plate R6) all just tied by fair “0*0” Numerals, with fine red 16
Oct. London arrival backstamp. Letters containing coin were not allowed under the Concession Rates system but
this letter must have contained a bank draft or some such, but one weighing very little (as the rate was 3d up to only
¼oz + the 6d Fee). This is one of only six recorded Registered G.B. covers from the Crimean War. Thought to be a
Unique franking and the only known one sent at the Concession rate (the other five were sent at the 1s-6d or 1s-5d
rates). [Illust. in CWS 1997, pp. 37 + 45.] Highly Important Exhibition Item. [Ex RL PH auction Mar 1988, lot 318,

\caption{873 REGISTERED MAIL - THE UNIQUE COVER WITH 1/- EMBOSSED + SIX 1d REDS FOR THE 1s-6d RATE
HAVING UNIQUE(?) BRITISH ARMY P.O. “REGISTERED LETTER” MARK; Remarkable 1 Apr. 1856 env.
(opened out for display; overall soiling/wear) to Birmingham (Missent to Buckingham; 17 Apr. c.d.s. on the front)
with very fine small blue “POST OFFICE/B/BRITISH ARMY” c.d.s. on the side-flap matching the mainly very fine
blue handstruck “REGISTERED LETTER” mark (clearly struck in the Army P.O.; the only known example?)
overstruck by a fair red London “[Crown]/REGISTERED” mark; franked by a cut-to-shape GB Embossed 1/- Green
and Six 1d Red ‘Stars’ (Strip of Three + Pair + single - one with corner fault and the Strip with faults where folded
over the edge of this small envelope) all tied by mainly fine London “41” transit Numerals (and the 1d Red single &
Pair also tied by a second fair strike of the blue “REGISTERED LETTER” mark). Letters containing coin were not
allowed under the Concession Rates system and so the rate for this letter was the full civilian 1/- postage + 6d fee
rate; this is one of only six recorded Registered G.B. covers from the Crimean War and the only one with the 1/-
Embossed stamp. There has been some discussion as to whether the “REGISTERED LETTER” mark was struck in the Army P.O. or in transit
in Buckingham; no such Buckingham mark is known, but more importantly the letter had to be marked as Registered in the Army P.O., and there is
no other such marking apart from this blue straight-line mark and the red London “REGISTERED/[Crown]”, so the blue mark must have been
applied first, and at the Army P.O. The extreme rarity of this Crimea registered mail mark can be ascribed to its having presumably been issued very
late in the War; this cover is the latest of the six known G.B. registered Crimean War covers. Important and Unique Crimean War
Registered Cover. [With 2008 RPS cert. also suggesting that the blue Registered mark was applied in the Army P.O.
rather than in Buckingham.] Estimate £1,500}

he himself posted the Letter in question in the Regimental Letter Box in which was enclosed a ½ Sovereign addressed to
Mrs. Healy, No.171 Great Britain Street, Dublin and is satisfied that the said Letter was in a secure state when posted”.
The great cost of registering letters meant that Private soldiers risked sending coins in their letters back to G.B. Plus 19 July

the French from the disease, the issue of rum to the troops (to be paid for by each soldier), etc. Very rare insight into
