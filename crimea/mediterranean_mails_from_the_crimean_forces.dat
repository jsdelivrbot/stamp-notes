\chapter{Mediterranean Mails from the Crimean Forces}

\section{Malta}

During the Crimean War, Malta served as a hospital base for wounded combatants, and acquired the nickname Nurse of the Mediterranean. This had an important effect on Malta since the island had to support in various ways teh Anglo-French and later Italian expeditionary forces in the Black Sea. Malta was a \textit{de facto} rear base headquarters for the allies. It was the main military and supply depot, the major naval base and arsenal and a major hospital centre for wounded and diseased troops. The military and naval resources of Malta were indeed fully stretched during this war. This had also an economic impact with inflation rising but also many Maltese experiencing flourishing trade.

\caption{878 MALTA - EARLY PAIR OF 1s-9d RATE COVERS TO G.B. EX H.M.S. “CALLIOPE”, ETC.; 15 May - 2 June 1854
EL (two long sheets) written on “[H.M.S.] Calliope” to London “via Marseilles” with a fine large “MALTA” c.d.s. (3 June)
on the flap, and so charged “1/9”, describing the voyage out from England to Malta en route to Constantinople with cavalry
horses (“...We shall I expect stay at Malta a few hours as we shall want more bran for the horses...this morning a steamer
appeared and I am happy to say took us in tow...Direct to Constantinople. We have to go to sea again at once. Post Office
in London will give you particulars if you want them.”). Plus similar 2 Apr. 1854 EL written on “No.14 Transport” (identified
from contemporary newspaper report) “off Cape St. Vincent” also carrying horses with good contents describing
accidentally running down a small Dutch ship off “Scilly”, and ending at Malta (10 May c.d.s.) charged “1/9” to Ireland
with fine scarce blue Irish village “GLANWORTH” endorsed “Miss Sent” in red and overlapping a similar fine blue
“CASTLETOWNROCHE”. (2 covers) PHOTO - see page 23. £200}

(AT MALTA?) WITH 1d RED IMPERF.; Fine [c.15] Apr. 1854 small env. to Glasgow headed & countersigned for
the 1d Concession Rate for a “Seaman on Board H.M. Ship Rodney” with GB 1d Red Imperf. (4 margins but just
touched at bottom right) tied by a London “31” transit Numeral (matching fine red London 3 May backstamp);
HMS ‘Rodney’ was noted in the ‘Morning Post’ of 10 Apr. 1854 (p.3) as being on the “Mediterranean Station” as at
27 March, so presumably this letter was sent from Malta. Rare usage of the 1d Imperf. at this late date. [Illust. in

\caption{880 MALTA - EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF G.B. STAMPS IN MALTA? - 3d-RATE COVER TO G.B. WITH 1d REDS
TIED BY LARGE “MALTA” C.D.S. & LONDON NUMERALS; Remarkable 30 July - 4 Aug. 1854 EL from a British
Officer “Off the coast of Portugal on board the Himalaya” to the Isle of Wight headed & countersigned for the 3d
Concession Rate for a Corporal in the Scots Greys, with three GB 1d Reds (one affixed with wafer and damaged -
possibly used and damaged before use? - one poorly cut, and one with just a few cut perfs. at top) all tied by mainly
very fine London “42” transit Numerals, but two also tied by a heavily indented and rather unclear large
“MALTA/AU 4/1854” c.d.s. (note letter’s PS; “We have arrived in Malta safely...Friday [4 Aug.]”). The long and
interesting letter (*full typed transcript) described the voyage from England with 350 men and 350 horses on board
in very cramped conditions with sightings of Spain and Gibraltar. The famous Malta ‘Grid’ cancel was not in use
until April 1855, and we have only noted the part cover (of 16 Mar. 1855) in the Ken Clough Collection [Cavendish
Sept. 1998, lot 1059; realised £805] with a similar large “MALTA” c.d.s. cancel to this (also with London Numerals)
on perf. 1d Red + 2d Blue (on a cover ex the Black Sea Fleet). This cover may therefore be the earliest known use of
a Malta cancellation on G.B. stamps and it is certainly one of only a handful of Malta c.d.s. cancellation items.

(contemporary pencil note on the front) to Scotland headed & countersigned for the 1d Concession rate for a Lance
Corporal of the 93rd Highlanders with a GB 1d Red ‘Stars’ (off-centre; probably Plate R3) tied by a mainly very
fine strike of the distinctive Malta “P.” in oval mark (MSC Type AF-1) with backstamps of London (21 Feb.) and
Errol (22 Feb.). The Malta ‘Grid’ cancel is known from April 1855 to Oct. 1856, so this must be a forerunner of that
type of cancel - used on Naval/Maritime mail of the British Crimean Forces. Only one other cover has been recorded
with this Malta “P.” cancellation (a civilian rate cover to Italy). Highly Important G.B. Used in Malta Exhibition

Maria, Cerigo and here...”. Unlike the force in Greece, the Ionian Is. Garrison does not seem to have qualified for
the Concession rate - presumably because the mail had to travel via Trieste rather than via France. [Illust. in CWS

[c.8] Oct. 1856 env. (overall dusting & slight staining) to Kent “via Triest” headed (but not countersigned) for the 1d
Concession Rate for a seaman on “H.M.S. Viper, Patras” with a GB 1d Red ‘Stars’ tied by an unclear London transit
Numeral with faint red London backstamp (18 Oct.); this ship had been in the Black Sea Fleet for most of the
Crimean War and it seems that in Oct. 1856 she was stationed in Greece (“protecting British trade at Patras” -
‘Morning Post’ 22 Oct. 1856, p.5) as the war effort was winding down. The fact that the letter was accepted for the
Concession Rate but was not countersigned by the “Commanding Officer” is unusual; a similar unsigned 1d-rate
cover (but more badly stained) from this correspondence (from this ship in Patras) has been recorded, which was
also accepted without extra charge. [With RPS 1990 cert. referring to the lack of Commanding Officer’s signature,
but wrongly stating that the letter was sent by private means to London - it displays all the usual traits of a letter
sent by Naval Bag.] [Illust. in CWS, p.18.] [Ex RL PH auction, Mar. 1988, lot 253; realised £286.] PHOTO - page 33. £300}
