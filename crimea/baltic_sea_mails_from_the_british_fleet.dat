IMPERF. 1d RED VIA WISMAR; Unique(?) 5 Apr. 1854 env. (opened out for display) to London with a poor
uncancelled GB 1d Red Imperf. on the front but posted in the civilian P.O. at “WISMAR” (Mecklenburg) and
apparently treated as an unpaid letter, endorsed (in a second hand) “Per Copenhagen” but with a partly fine
“HAGENOW-ROSTOCK” Railway T.P.O. c.d.s. (5 Apr.) & red London (8 Apr.) backstamp, and charged “11½” on
delivery; sent before the special arrangements to send mail via Danzig had been started (perhaps the sender thought
it might be carried privately to GB and posted there, hence the stamp), and thought to be the earliest known British
Baltic Fleet cover. Unique usage of the 1d Red Imperf. from the German States! [Ex Sybil Morgan; illust. in ‘The
Philatelist’ May 1954, p.203.] £400 }

Aug. 1854 unpaid env. (small closed tear well clear of c.d.s.) to Thirsk (believed to be from R.S. Crompton on board
the flagship H.M.S. Duke of Wellington; see a matching cover two lots below) charged “8[d]” with a mainly very
fine 2-ring “DANZIG/10-11” c.d.s. on the front beside a cancelled Prussian “4” rate with London transit backstamp
(29 Aug.). Of some 50 recorded Danzig British Baltic Fleet covers, only 6 have been recorded for 1854 (of which 4
were charged 8d, one was prepaid 8d and one was a 1d Concession Rate cover). These letters were taken from the
Fleet off the small Russian island of Nargen and posted by the British Consul in Danzig. Very rare early Baltic Fleet

Blockade. Plus 24 Jan. 1855 EL sent from “Riga” (Latvia) to “Christinestad, Finland” with fair boxed Riga

cover from the 1855 Campaign. Unpaid Danzig Fleet covers are rarer than those with 1d Reds. Good example of

winter. £300}

\section{Denmark and Sweden}

Denmark was internally divided between supporting the allies or Russia and would have preferred to be neutral. The conservatives were sympathetic to Russia because of the Russian support for Denmark in its recent war with the German states over {{wi:Schleswig}} and {{wi:Holstein}}. A treaty of 1852 also gave the Russians the key role in the selection of a new Danish royal family if the current line died out, as seemed likely. On the other hand liberal elements in the countr tended to favour the allies. Denmark was weka and could not afford the war. It was also economically dependent on Britain, particular for coal supplies, and it still feared a repetition of teh British attack on Copenhagen in 1801 and 1807.\footnote{CLive Pontig, The Crimean War: The Truth Behind the Myth}
