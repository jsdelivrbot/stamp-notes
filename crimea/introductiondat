##The Crimean War

###Background
Distinctive postmarks are known from the Crimean War and many lesser campaigns, while both sides in the American Civil War (1861-5) and the Franco-German War (1870-1) not only operated field posts for service personnel but whipped up public support with patriotic motifs on civilian mail.

The Crimean War, also known in Russia as the Eastern War (Russian: Восточная война, Vostochnaya Voina) (October 1853[13][14]–February 1856) was fought between the Russian Empire on one side and an alliance of France, the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Sardinia (which would be absorbed into Italy in 1861), and the Ottoman Empire on the other. The war was part of a long-running contest between the major European powers for influence over territories of the declining Ottoman Empire. Most of the conflict took place on the Crimean Peninsula, with additional actions occurring in western Turkey and the Baltic Sea region.

The Crimean War is sometimes considered to be the first "modern" conflict and "introduced technical changes which affected the future course of warfare."[15]
