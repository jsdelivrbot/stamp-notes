\chapter{Covers with  ""0*0"" numerals}

The Piat Dewavrin Collection of the Postal History of the Crimean War took more than 20
years to create before it was first awarded an International Large Gold Medal in 1992 at the
Granada International FIP Exhibition in Spain. Francois then continued to improve what was
already an astonishing collection; his researches enabled him to include material from the
little-known Pacific Ocean Naval campaigns, while he unearthed unique items from the
Russian forces, and covers of the British-German Legion, etc. The collection was awarded
another Large Gold Medal at the International FIP Exhibition at Bangkok 1993, and a third
Large Gold at the 1997 International FIP Exhibition in Finland. It was at this ‘Finlandia 95’
Exhibition that this Collection also deservedly won the Grand Prix International. 

All the previous significant collections of Crimean War Postal History; notably those of Sybil Morgan (RL PH
auction Mar. 1988), John Dodd (Cavendish, Feb. 1990), Peter Chadwick (Cavendish Mar. 1997), and Kelly Tighe (Spink,
Oct. 1997). These provenances are all noted in the descriptions. [It should be noted that Francois decided that his French
Forces’ & Austrian mails should be auctioned in France rather than in the UK, so these will be sold by postal auction by
Lugdunum in the same week as this public Cavendish auction in Derby.] So the sale of the Piat Collection is by far the largest
dispersal of Crimean War material ever to have taken place; none of the previous collections included even as many as 100
lots.

\section{Star and Cyphers (OXO) Cancellation}

This was the second type used in the Crimea and is commonly called "OXO". It was despatched to the Crimea in March 1855 (the earliest known use March 24th). It continued to be used until September 1856 and possibly later. The cancellation is usually clearly impressed in black or in shades of green and blue.
