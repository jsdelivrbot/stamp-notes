\chapter{The Crown and Stars Cancellation}

The first type of Crimea obliterator, the Crown and Stars, was sent to the Crimea on 27th May 1854. It is known used in August 1854 (Figure~\ref{crimea:0804}) and according to Robson Lowe remained in use until 26th April 1855. Impressions of this type are generally poor.

The original postal rates were 1/6 per \half oz., but these were reduced on 3rd April 1854 to 11d (5d to Gibraltar or Malta + 6d to the U.K) per 1/2 oz. Newspapers were sent at 1d. 

The mail was normally carried by the French mail packets from the middle of May, at a rate of 3d. for each 1/4 oz. and 2d. for each newspaper. In many cases the 3d. rate was not pre-paid. 

Soldiers and Seamen letters, as well as newspapers, were carried by the British naval vessels as opportunity offered at the rate of 1d. each (See \textit{The Philatelist}, Vol. XIII, page 289). Covers using the soldiers and seamen concession rate are rare (Figure~\ref{crimea:0808}).

\section{HMS Queen and Scutari Hospital}

HMS Queen was a 110-gun first rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 15 May 1839 at Portsmouth. She was the last purely sailing battleship to be completed - subsequent ones had steam engines as well although all British battleships were constructed with sailing rig until the 1870s.\index{Ships!HMS Queen}

In 1854, she participated in the bombardment of Sevastopol during the Crimean War. She was set on fire three times and eventually forced to withdraw from the action. The famous Timothy the tortoise, who was about 160 years old when she died in 2004, was the ship's mascot during this time.

\section{HMS Sidon}

HMS Sidon was a first-class paddle frigate designed by Sir Charles Napier: her name commemorated his attack on the port of Sidon in 1840 during the Syrian War. Her keel was laid down on 26 May 1845 at Deptford Dockyard, and she was launched on 26 May 1846. She had a fairly short career for a warship, but it included the rescue of the crew of the sinking Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation vessel Ariel on 28 May 1848, and a trip up the Nile that same year, when her passengers included the explorer and botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker. 

She served in the Black Sea during the Crimean War, 1854-55 under the command of Captain George Goldsmith. In April 1854, in company with HMS Firebrand (Captain William Houston Stewart), she blockaded the coast from Kavarna to the mouths of the River Danube.[2] In September, during the actual Allied invasion of the Crimea, she was assigned to escorting the French troop transports, and assisted the French line-of-battleship Algiers, which had gone aground in Eupatoria Bay.[3] She was then sent to monitor Russian movements around Odessa, and on 4 October attacked a marching column of 12,000 men on their way to the Crimea. On this occasion she was hit in the funnel by a Russian rocket.[4] She was sold for breaking up on 15 July 1864 to Castle and Beech. The cover shown in Figure \ref{crimea:0813} was posted by Captain George Goldsmith when the frigate was at {{wi:Balaklava}}.
