##Background
###The Crimean War
In March 1854 British troops together with an expeditionary force from 
France were sent to Turkey and the {{wi:Crimea}} in support of the Turks against the Russians.
Thus the {{wi: Crimean_War}} started.

Initially it was decided that the normal civilian postal service 
to Turkey and the Black Sea was sufficient and therefore no British Post Office 
representative was sent to handle the Army's mails. 
Mail was despatched from London via the French 'overland route' 
and onto Constantinople (now Istanbul). 
There it was handed to the French Consular Postal Service who in turn, 
passed it to the French Army Post Office for distribution to the British Army. 
Return the French packets from Constantinople to Malta carried mail 
where it was transferred via the British Post Office agent onto 
vessels bound for Southampton. 


The outbound system from Britain proved to be both expensive and inadequate. 
As William Russell, The Times correspondent reported: 
"There is always something wrong about our letters. 
At present the French Post Office here is a receptacle 
of several hundred letters addressed to the generals, 
staff officers and officers of every Regiment which the [French]
 postmaster refuses to give up until some chivalrous person pays 
 £ 12 (300 francs) for the whole bundle and to 
 take the chance of being repaid by the various 
 persons... ...to whom they are addressed." 
 Further evidence of the problem is illustrated 
 by an officer in the Rifle Brigade, Henry Clifford, who later 
won a VC at Inkerman. He wrote in a letter home: " 
I have just received your letter. It was left here in 
the French Post Office with 12 letters for me, 
they not having the three Queen's Heads [reference to a 1d stamp] 
requisite upon them. For the last 3 months I have not heard from England. .." 
By May 1854, a new deal over the transit cost was struck with 
the French postal authorities and this also partly solved the 
problem of holding unpaid mail. Mail was despatched as before 
but on its arrival in Constantinople British officers handled it, 
but unfortunately they had no experience in postal matters and there 
was soon a build up of undelivered letters. In the meantime, the Secretary of State for War 
had received many letters of complaint and took the matter up with the Postmaster General 
(Rowland Hill). He was informed by the Postmaster General that: 
"with view to relieving the Officers of HM forces in 
Turkey from the irksome business of superintending the
 arrangement and distribution of the large mass of 
 correspondence of which mails between this country 
 and the Army are likely to be composed, the Postmaster 
General has determined upon dispatching an intelligent and experienced Officer of this Department to act as Army Postmaster" Edward Smith, of the Post Office Inland Letter Section, was appointed as the Army Postmaster, and left London in June 1854 with an Assistant Army Postmaster, Thomas Angell. On their arrival they set up a Base Army Post Office in Constantinople. One of their first tasks was to recover the unpaid mails from the French. This they achieved by using their own money as well as borrowing £50 from, the Commander-in-Chief, Lord Raglan (1788-1855). A month later the Assistant Army Postmaster, Thomas Angell set up an Army Post Office in Varna in support of the Army Headquarters. A regular seaborne mail service was established between Varna and Constantinople. 

In late summer, an invasion fleet of some 600 ships and 50,00 men gathered at Varna creating a shortage of accommodation which prompted the Assistant Army Postmaster to obtain Lord Raglan's permission to operate from the ship Ganges, but the ship sailed for the Crimea before the Assistant Army Postmaster had moved on board. So he established the Army Post Office on the Sovereign which was smaller. 

This caused him sorting difficulties as his report reflects: "Scarcely had the sorting operation commenced (by making use of buckets for letter boxes) when a perfect rush was made aboard, officers, non-commissioned officers and privates came to demand the letters and papers for their respective regiments, it was in vain that I endeavoured to interpose a barrier to enable me to continue the sorting unmolested... [because of the confusion caused he sorted through the night] ...On the following morning, at five o'clock, I signalled 'Send for letters', but the order being given shortly after for the whole fleet to weigh anchor I was unable to dispose of them. " 

The force landed at Eupatoria on 14 September 1854, the army disembarked and marched to Balaklava. On the instructions of Headquarters Smith and Agnell switched places. The Adjutant General, General Estcourt instructed that the mails should be organised as follows: ". ..When a mail arrives you [Smith] should as speedily as possible inform me of it and name an hour either that day or the next for the delivery of letters at the Headquarters Encampment ...When a mail is to be dispatched you should in like manner inform me when you will collect letters at the Headquarters Encampment and carry them off with you to the vessel which is to carry them away..." 

The provision of a proper mail service was hampered by a lack of suitable labour, shipping movement details, dedicated transport and inappropriate accommodation. It came to a head when the following report appeared in the Daily News dated 13 January 1855 (Balaklava): "Whenever complaints become inconveniently local, the London Post Office is in the habit of requesting the Postmaster here the state of the case. Such a demand is unfair and unreasonable. 

A little candour and common sense properly applied would make the Post Office authorities understand that nothing short of confusion can be expected from a Department which as the Post Office to the Forces, is sent out in a pitiful state of hopelessness, with a heavy load of responsibility and with no adequate means of labour resources and powers ..." 

The article then goes on to mention the use of soldiers to assist at the Army Post Office " A close and patient enquiry into the details of the Army Post Office has convinced me that not the slightest blame attaches to the two Postmasters Smith and Angell, who are merely victims of circumstances. If these gentlemen have committed a fault it is that they did not ruin their prospects in the service to which they belonged by refusing to take upon themselves the responsibility for the mismanagement of others. 

Instead of detaching the Army Post Office with a sufficient number of clerks and with a couple of carts, drivers and horses for the conveyance of mails they were referred to Naval agents and the superciliousness of young gentlemen attached to the Staff." Soon after the publication of this news article two more Assistant Army Postmasters, Mr Sissons and Henry Mellersh, plus seven sorters were despatched from London. 

They arrived in Constantinople on 5 February 1855. Mr Mellersh was to play a significant part in the establishment of a dedicated Army Postal Service, as he was to become a member of a joint War Office and Post Office committee set up in 1876 to investigate the viability of such post service. He was the only member on the committee who had first hand experience of providing a mail service under war conditions. A further Army Post Office was established at Scutari, to provide postal services to the Barrack Hospital staff and patients.


###First International Money Order Service

In response to demands made by Florence Nightingale, a method of transmitting money was devised to allow troops to transfer monies back to their families at home in the United Kingdom. This was designed to prevent drunkenness and became the world's first International Money Order Service. In its first month of operation £ 7,000 was remitted by the British troops.

Afterwards Malta and Gibraltar were allowed to send, but not to receive orders. By the end of the decade Canada started to send and receive them and the rest of the dominions and colonies of the British Empire gradually followed. In 1869, money orders began to be exchanged with foreign countries, the first two being Switzerland and Belgium. In 1883 they were supplemented by the Postal Order. Peace was declared on 30 March 1856. The Army post Offices in Varna, Scutari and Balaklava were closed, while the Base Army Post Office in Constantinople remained opened and became the centre of the British postal service in the Levant until the outbreak of the First World War.

Shortly after the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854 a branch of the British Army Post Office was established in Constantinople as a sorting and forwarding station for the vast numbers of letters passing to and from the various units of the British forces in the Crimea, as well as those of the Turkish contingent. Sub-offices were in operation in the Crimea and Scutari. This was the first office outside the United Kingdom to make use of British postage stamps, which were issued there about November 1854. Mail which originated, or passed through Constantinople, were cancelled with the "Crown in Stars" or the "O*O" cancels.
