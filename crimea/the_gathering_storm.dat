"GIBRALTAR & NORWAY - PRE-WAR LETTERS WITH COMMENT ON THE UNREST IN TURKEY & RUSSIA; 9/23 June 1853 EL & E ex ""Gibraltar"" (scarce blackish-brown ""GIB./S. ROQUE/ANDA. BAXA"" on the front) or ""TRONDHEIM"" (v. fine blue c.d.s. on the front) sent unpaid to Cadiz/London, both with worried comments about the rumours of war between Turkey and Russia; [Gibraltar] ""...la guerra sera inevitable..."", or [Norway] ""Turkey seems in a mess, I wonder what the Turkeys [sic] will do; I am very keen for the next news."" Russia had issued an ultimatum to the Turks on 21 May 1853, and they invaded Moldo-Wallachia on 2 July 1853, so these writers were right to be concerned.
