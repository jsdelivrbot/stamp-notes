###Indian stamps used in Burma

Starting in 1854, Burma used the stamps of British India without any form of overprinting. The stamps may be identified by the postmarks used which, after 1856, were specially prepared for Burma post offices

###Stamps inscribed Burma

The first stamps inscribed Burma in the design, rather than simple overprints, were definitive stamps of King George VI issued between 1938 and 1940. On 6 May 1940 a commemorative stamp was issued to celebrate the centenary of the first postage stamp. The stamp was created by overprinting a regular 2 Anna, 6 Pies, definitive stamp with a special design.

###Japanese occupation

During World War II, Burma was occupied by the Japanese between 1942 and 1945. Stamps were issued by the Japanese Army and by the Burma Independence Army in 1942. In 1943 and 1944 stamps were issued by the Burma Government with the permission of the occupying forces.[1]
[edit]British Military Administration

After the liberation of Burma, normal postal services were gradually restored under a British Military Administration. Pre-war stamps of Burma from 1938 were overprinted MILY ADMN in 1945.


###Civilian administration

When civilian administration of Burma was restored, new stamps were issued in the designs of the stamps from 1938 but in different colours. In 1946 a set of four Victory stamps were issued and in 1947 the 1946 set was overprinted Interim Government in Burmese characters.
