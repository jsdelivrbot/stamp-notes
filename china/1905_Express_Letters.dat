## Imperial Express Letter Post

Express letter stamps form one of the most fascinating part of postal history of the imperial era. 
Not only being the largest stamp in the world, it is also a postal record, postage stamp and postal receipts all in one.

The express letter service was initiated on the 4th. of NOVEMBER 1905. Trying to win over long time user of the 'MIN CHU' postal system. It first serviced between Peking, Tientsin and Shanghai and was expanded to 51 towns in 1909 and 72 towns by the end of the Imperial period. Each of these towns was assigned different indexes from the '1000 words essay' which none of the words are duplicated and thus unique to the town. The '1000 words essay' was exhausted by the end of the Imperial period and 2 character indexes appear in the early Republics.
Minimum records are found on which stamp is first issued and until today no persons are sure of which of the two first issues was actually issued first.
