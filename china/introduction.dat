The stamps of China and its Postal History present difficulties to Western collectors mainly due to language and to the vastness of the subject.  It also presented a problem as to how to organize such a vast topic and to try and make it as interesting as possible. 

If you are a newcomer to the field my recommendation is to first try and understand the Chinese history and a bit of its geography. Although you might decide to narrow down your collecting field to a section of China, still you will need to have a global overview. Joining a society can help, as well as getting some basic literature such as the Scott or Gibbons catalogues or if you live in the East the yang catalogue. A very good catalogue is the German Michel, but rather difficult to follow if you do not speak German. If you want to get into it as an investor, buy all the books available study all the past auctions you can and then invest. 

Personally, I think there might be better investment strategies, but certainly - especially if you are investing from the West you are bound to get good growth, if nothing else due to the Chinese currency gaining strength in the long run. Having said that currently (2012) all the market indications show that the Asian market will keep on growing. In recent auctions auctioneers are fast to highlight new records, we quote Gert Muller:
