Formerly called and best known as the Lithographed Coiling Dragon 
According to The History of Chinese Postage Stamps Volume II (published December 2004), archives of Imperial Post Office verified that this set of definitives was designed by R. A. de Villard and engraved and printed in Japan by retired Italian artist and master engraver Edoardo Chiossone as a private contractor, and the process employed was typographic not lithographic as its old name suggested. Due to some unsatisfactory experience in their cooperation such as printing quality and delayed delivery, IPO decided to order another set of definitives from Waterlow & Sons Limited, London.

Since the English inscription on this issue is Imperial Chinese Post, collectors called it as ICP Issue, and the Waterlow, London print as CIP Issue for the English inscription of that issue is Chinese Imperial Post.
