China 1885 Small Dragons 3can Scott no. 11, Chan no. 14, 
top marginal block of 9 MNH ** and MXLH * respectively, 
with virtually full original gum throughout, impeccable and 
extremely well preserved, 6 stamps are absolutely MNH ** and 
in post office fresh condition whilst 3 stamps are MXLH *, 
the last unit (third row, third stamp) shows a vague and almost 
invisible trace of having been previously hinged and the last 
two stamps in the left column (which are the 
fourth and seventh units respectively in the block) 
show a very narrow (3 mm) strip of hinge in between them, but still retain virtually all of their original gum, the block has full sheet margin at top, which is very lightly hinged in two places, it is perforated 12½ clean cut and it is from Setting III. The stamps show the “Tai-Chi Diagram” watermark in normal position, display wonderful colour throughout and good perforations for this particular type (since most of the Small Dragons perf. 12½ clean cut are much more untidy round the edges than this block) and there is not even the slightest separation whatsoever, which is truly unbelievable for this early and fragile multiple. The gum is in superb condition, showing a most pleasant patina and, surprisingly, not affecting the extremely fresh overall aspect, but rather enhancing it just by its very presence (original gum on the Small Dragons stamps, especially on those of the first printing of 1885, is very seldom seen on most of the examples offered on the market).

The 3can 1885 Small Dragon perf. 12 1/2 clean cut 
is the most elusive of all the basic Small Dragons stamps (excluding varieties, of course) and there is no complete sheet of it recorded. Supposedly, there isn’t even a complete pane recorded, though I can’t back this information with any written reference. Be that as it may, this is clearly one of the largest multiples of this stamp in existence and definitely in the best possible quality. Basically, it is absolutely fault-free in all respects and of incredible freshness all over.

As it is always the case in philately, multiples of already scarce stamps are exponentially rarer than any other multiples, and the larger they are, the rarer they are. This is a superlative item in all respects, perfectly combining extreme rarity, incredible quality, one that is almost impossible to find on rarities of this caliber, and philatelic refinement and specialism of the highest standing, just to become an emblematic icon of the top specialised collections and one of the referential items for an entire issue of classic and highly sought after stamps, which are the Small Dragons. This represents a huge opportunity for the eBay market, one that will surely remain unique for many years to come.
