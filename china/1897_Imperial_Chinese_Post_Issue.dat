##1897 Imperial Chinese Post Issue

In 1897 stamps the first issue of the Imperial Chinese Post was issued. This was of 12 denominations from 1/2 cent to $5. 
The Imperial Chinese Post Issue was the first official postage stamps of the National Postal Service of China. It was issued in late 1897 and it's normal usage last until late 1898. The issue was designed by Mr. R. A. deVillard and was lithographed and printed in Japan. Since it's coexisted with the Provisional Surcharged Issues, the cancellations on these stamps are much similar.
 
In 1892, Robert Hart suggested to Tsungli Yamen to establish a national post office again, and later in 1895 made a 4 chapter, 44 articles of Postal Guide for the modern postal service. In 1896 Robert Hart succeeded in founding the Imperial Post Office / 大清郵政官局 and appointed the Inspector General of Posts / 總郵政司. Money came from Customs Funds. The innumerable rules, regulations and problems that had to be overcome were legion. He paid attention to every 
possible matter from opening a new department to the design of a postage stamp.
