##1897 Surcharges on Dowager 60th Birthday Commemorative Issue


In 1897 stamps od the small dragon design were surcharged with new currency rates. These are shown below.
There are essentially two types distinguished by the height of the letters and commonly referred to by collectors as the small
or large surcharges. Covers are relatively rare and costly.

China, 1897 (25 Mar.) envelope to Mount Pleasant, Ohio via Yokohama (3.4) and San Francisco (19.4) bearing 1897 small figures surcharge on Dowager 1st printing 5c. on 5ca. pair, cancelled by "Imperial Post Office/Nanking" oval d.s. in brown, and Japan 5s. blue cancelled by "Shanghai/I.J.P.O." c.d.s (28.3), sealed envelope opening tear at right not affecting stamps, very fine and desirable early Imperial P.O. cancellation. Chan 41.

Although the rate to the U.S.A. through the Japanese Post Office was only 5 cents (5 sen), the sender franked the cover with 10 cents in postage in case the mails left earlier through the French Post Office, and he could accordingly take advantage of whichever service was fastest.
Estimate HK$ 35,000 - 40,000
