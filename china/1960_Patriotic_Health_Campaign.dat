##China 1960 Patriotic Health Campaign

 After years of civil war, health conditions in the country 
 were poor. The government launched "Great Patriotic Health 
 Campaigns" to teach communities how to prevent common 
 illnesses. In villages throughout the country, citizens 
 learned about hygiene and how to eradicate disease-carrying 
 pests such as snails and mosquitoes.

}     

One of the largest campaigns targeted the "four pests",  rats, flies, mosquitoes and grain-eating sparrows. With almost three-quarters of the population unable to read or write, to be effective these health education campaigns needed to provide critical information in an easily understandable format.
