##Valuing Chinese Stamps

I was in two minds as to the name of this article and if I should name it, buying Chinese stamps or "Valuing Chinese Stamps". I opted for the latter as it can appeal to both buyers and sellers.

There is no doubt that the Chinese Philatelic Market is currently overheating. It appears 
 that at least 70% of buyers buy stamps with a profit in mind and there is also talk and rumours of black money finding its way out of China via stamps. 

When I was a kid we set a mail order Company with a friend of mine and we used to buy full sheets of Chinese stamps for almost nothing. We gave them free as gifts to attract customers. Chinese stamps, especially c.t.o. and from the 50s onward are neither rare not scarce with the exception of perhaps a few of them ). Many were printed in over 400 million copies. However, MNH stamps must have survived in lower numbers, which although are still high compared with other countries offer some means of scarcity. Commercially used covers are much scarcer (not FDCs) and if you have preservation of your capital in mind and perhaps making a profit if the growth in demand continues then I would suggest you focus on the latter.

For most of the world the postal history market has had a steady growth over the years and strong values especially for good material. Here, I need to make an interjection and say that most stamp collectors always look to buy a stamp at the lowest possible cost whereas a postal history collector tends to pay at the limit of his/her abilities to obtain a particular cover. After all it is a unique item. At the moment a lot of Chinese collectors only focus on stamps and non-Chinese speaking collectors finding difficult to collect postal history due to the language barrier.

A favourite area of mine where there is a good opportunity for appreciation as well as endless hours of happy collecting, is the inflation era stamps and especially on cover.

Early pre-stamp covers are under-appreciated currently by the Chinese market, but once all those collectors graduate to more serious philately the market value for these is bound to sky rocket. They are very few and limited.  

My advice stamps will always be available and no need to bid them to sky rocket prices, be more careful when you buy. Under studied and under focus areas, will probably provide more material and more enjoyment than just buying another expensive Mao stamp. 

Take all the above with a bit of salt. After all I am a collector and I am speaking from a Collector's point of view. If you looking to stamps as an investment I would recommend you do this only after examining all other investment opportunities. The discouraging part of stamps a an investment is buyer's and seller's fees which are atrociously high.

Although your best guide can only be a good catalogue, in these series of articles when I give an indication of price I give the source (in many instances those of a major auction house). I believe this is perhaps the best way to indicate a price range, especially for material that is not commonly seen. For the more down to earth material I give an indication range of prices based on my own research at ebay auctions and sales.  In the end your best guide is a good stamp dealer, experienced in your area of collecting, but remember Dealer's need to provide food for their families too, so expect prices to vary.
