\chapter{China 1949 Introduction to the Silver Yuan Issues}

The Silver Yuan issues are difficult to follow in general 
catalogues. We refer here mostly to Chan, but extensive use was 
made of Jones "The Silver Currency Stamps and Temporary Labels of China, 
3rd Edition 1975" and the Ma catalogue. We also referred to some named 
sales and from where most of the images came.

Besides the stamps with the design of the flying geese printed in 
Shanghai another set of stamps was printed in Chungking by the Hwa 
Nan Printing Company. These stamps bear the portrait of Dr Sun Yat 
Sen and are similar to the Gold Yuan issue. The wording, plates and 
other details are the same with the exception of an additional 
inscription next to the value "You Zi" which in Chinese means postage.

There are other distinguishing characteristics. The shading lines 
on the face of Dr. Sun Yat Sen are more sparse with only 
five semicircular dotted lines drawn and the secret mark "H N" 
are set near the character "zi" below the right shoulder.

The set is composed of 9 denominations and printed using 
lithography in sheets of stamps 20x20. The motif dimension is 18 x 21 mm.
The 100 cts and 500 cts are expensive, whereas the rest are priced modestly.

There are two varieties recorded in Stanley Gibbons imperforate vertical and imperforate pairs and not priced used. Mints are 
\pound600 for an imperforate pair and \pound500 for imperforate 
between vertical pairs.
