RARE SHANGHAI CHINA to SF CALIF 1948 AIR LETTER Sun Stamps w Overprints HISTORIC1948 SHANGHAI AIR LETTER

Here you have a RARE, unique and historic Small Size "AIR LETTER" mailed from Shanghai China to San Francisco, California during the period when the Nationalists and Communists were vying for control of China, which fell to the latter in 1949.

The Air Letter opens up to 8 panels, 6 of which are filled with a letter written in German in clean legible handwriting. Excellent clean condition!

The letter was mailed by Jewish Displaced Persons who had escaped Austria in 1939 (the Rezeks) to the Myers, the side of the family living in California. The former had unsuccessfully tried to emigrate to the U.S. but only succeeded doing so in 1949 on the eve of the Communist takeover, thanks to the graces of the Truman administration.

The front displays the label "AIR LETTER" in English and Chinese as well as "PAR AVION". There are 4 different Sun Yat Sen stamps in exceptionally nice clean condition, two of which have hgiher overprinted denominations! There are two terrific Shanghai postmarks in English and Chinese.

The reverse states in English and Chinese: "If anything is enclosed or if affixed with more than four stamps, this letter will be sent by Ordinary Mail". It is also imprinted with "Price: $5,000, National Currency, each."

A unique and interesting relic from the last days of the Chinese Republic with ties to the holocaust and to California, the future home of the sender. This is our LAST ONE of these, and the nicest.  $199.0

### Postal rates

The Postal rates are based on a published article by H. James Maxwell, published originally in the China Clipper.

### Taking Care of Air Letters

One must not forget that during the period these air letters were bought, China was in turmoil. People were suffering and many had to save hard to buy these in order to communicate with their loved ones. These items are already over 60 years old and the paper constitution makes them very fragile. Store them in a album with a nice backing and protector sheets. 

### Estimates and Valuations

The figures shown, are probably on the low side. Expect to pay anything from $50 to in excess of $700.00. Given the short period of use, their fragile nature and the growing chinese philatelic market they can make a good long term investment, if you can part with them.
