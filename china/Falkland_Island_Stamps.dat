##Inspector General of Chinese Foreign Customs 

In spring of the following year, Robert Hart received from his college a 
British Foreign Office nomination as student interpreter in the China consular service.[4] 

His first destination was Hong Kong, where he served in the Superintendency of Trade under 
the orders of Sir John Bowring, the Governor of Hong Kong. 

In September 1854, Robert Hart was appointed to the British vice-consulate in Ningpo 
as supernumary interpreter. 

As a dispute broke out between the British Consul and the Portuguese Consul, 
Robert Hart was given the responsibility of managing the consulate for several months. 

Hart’s calmness and good judgement in the face of brutalities between the Chinese and Portuguese earned him favourable commendations from his superiors and led to his nomination to act as secretary to the allied commissioners governing the Canton in March 1858.[4] Hart first served under Sir Harry Parkes, then, in October 1858, was promoted to the British Consulate as interpreter under the orders of Sir Rutherford Alcock. The following year, Hart resigned to take up the post of local inspector of customs. From 1859 to 1861, this position allowed him to develop his expertise in the management of customs in China. In 1861, he was promoted to acting Inspector-General, and was named 
Inspector-General of Foreign Customs in 1863, a position he held until his retirement in 1907.[3]


As Inspector General of China's Imperial Maritime Custom Service (IMCS), his main duties included collecting customs duties for the Chinese government. His advice led to the improvement of China's port and navigation facilities. Hart was known for his managerial and diplomatic skills, and befriended many Chinese and Western officials, which allowed him to direct customs operations without interruption, including during periods of turmoil such as the Boxer Rebellion.

Yixin (奕訢), also known as Prince Gong (恭親王, 1833-1898) was head of the Zongli Yamen during the time of Robert Hart's tenure in the Maritime Customs and the two men held each other in high regard. Indeed, Robert Hart was so well known in the Tsungli Yamen that he had an affectionate nickname there of "our hart" (wǒmen de Hèdé. 我們的赫德).

He held his post till his retirement in 1907.[4]

##Awards and Recognition

His skills as Inspector-General were recognized by both Chinese and Western authorities, and he was bestowed several Chinese honorific titles, including the Red Button, or button of the highest rank, a Peacock's Feather, the order of the Double Dragon, and the title of Junior Guardian of the Heir Apparent. He was also appointed a CMG, KCMG, and GCMG, and received a baronetcy from Britain.

Hart had also been asked to become minister plenpotentiary at Peking in 1885, on the retirement of Sir Thomas Wade, but declined the honor as it would have caused a conflict of interest, stating he preferred to "teach China to be a better fisherman instead of handing her fish." [5]

His name is still remembered in Beijing through a street name in the Legation quarter.

<p style="font-size:smaller">
The statue of Robert Hart designed by Charles Guernier of Paris was originally installed on the Shanghai Bund on May 25, 1914, and relocated to a spot opposite the new Shanghai Customs House in 1928. During WWII, it was demolished by the puppet Customs House on Sep. 9, and the statue was taken away by the Japanese on Oct. 5, 1943.

On one of the bronze plaques there was an epitaph written by President Charles William Eliot of Harvard University:

"Inspector-General of the Chinese Maritime Customs.
Founder of the Chinese Lighthouse Service.
Organiser and Administrator of the National Post Office.
Trusted Counsellor of the Chinese Government.
True friend of the Chinese People.
Modest, Patient, Sagacious and Resolute.
He overcame Formidable Obstacles, and
Accomplished a work of Great Beneficence for China and the World."
