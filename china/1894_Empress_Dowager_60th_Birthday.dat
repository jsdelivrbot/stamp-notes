##1894 Empress Dowager 60th Birthday (Third Customs Issue)


In 1861 Sir Robert Hart, then the Acting Inspector General of the 
Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs who had the ambition to organize 
a modern national postal system in China emulating that of the Westerns, 
suggested to Tsungli Yamen that it would be to China's advantage that a national 
post office be founded. But Tsungli Yamen turned it down because 
it would have brought him into conflict with some powerful private vested interests. 
In 1866, the handling of mails of foreign envoys was reassigned to the Customs. 
Inspector General of Customs Robert Hart 
accepted to undertake the duty and set up the "Customs Postal Department" 
to handle mail delivery. Initially the Customs postal service handled only official 
documents and private letters for its staff and family members.

<img src="http://localhost/egypt/china-stamps/dowager_master_proofs.jpg" style="width:75%"/>
<p style="font-size:smaller">

	China, 1894 Dowager Empress 60th Birthday Master die proofs, large format, 1ca. to 24ca. set of nine later lithographic prints (reprints) on cream wove paper, fine.

Provenance,
M.D. Chow

Accompanied by a letter from Wei-Liang Chow dated 14 January 1991 : "I found them among the stamps I inherited from my father. As is generally known, the large black dowager proofs come in either a thin and slightly glazed paper or a somewhat thicker and more opaque paper; the former is rarer than the latter, and probably for this reason the former proofs are considered to be more authentic in some quarters. It seems to me that both are merely lithographed prints of the original drawings of de Villard, and I do not know why the one kind is considered to be more authentic than the other."
Estimate HK$ 10,000 - 12,000
