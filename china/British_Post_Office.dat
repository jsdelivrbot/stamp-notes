The low values featured a junk, while values from 15c to 50c showed a 
farmer reaping rice, while the dollar values depicted the three-part gateway to 
the Hall of Classics in Beijing. 


The series was first printed in London, then in Beijing from 1915; 
they can be distinguished by close examination. 

The designs were re-engraved in 1923, and a number of design features were changed; 
for instance, the whitecaps in the water underneath the junk were removed, and the water darkened.
