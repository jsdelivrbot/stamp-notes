##Valuing Chinese Covers

Valuing postal history covers, is a bit more difficult as there are a few guidelines. The late Robson Lowe in his Encyclopedia's listed prices for covers based on the underlying stamp value such as from x 10 used value etc. 

This is a good starting point but as you will observe from auctions it does not even come close to be true with the exception of some materials.

Auctioneers normally classify cover condition as:

\begin{description}
\item[Extremely Fine Superb]  outstanding, the envelope shows only the slightest
amount of wear, the stamp and cancel appear fresh

\item[Very Fine] choice condition, the envelope shows typical slight soiling or wear from
usage.

Fine to Very Fine  normal condition, the envelope shows a bit heavier wear or
soiling

Fine  evident wear, still a presentable example
\end{description}
Light edge wear, top backflap faults, slight reductions at one side, and file folds
are normal for 19th Century covers. Also normal are light cleaning and small
mends along the edges. They are to be expected and are not always described,
and are not grounds for claim or return.

In my opinion your starting point will be similar covers that have sold at auction. You can then adjust based on the following parameters:

    Are the postmarks clear?
    Is the cover free from excessive rust spots and foxing?
    Is the addressee and sender clearly identified? 
    Does the cover tell a story?
    Are the stamps unique?
    Is the cover, envelope suitable for write-up and display?
    Is the cover visually appealing?

I think the last two points are the most important. If the cover is to be displayed in an exhibition then it should be able to tell a story. For example any inflation time material
can be used to tell the "story of postal rates during 1945-1949."  On the other hand cultural revolution covers can be used to weave the social history of the events during the revolution.

Using again the inflation period as a guideline, one could start with a base price of say
$30 and adjust upwards as follows:

    Very clean and clear marks - add $5
    Clear writing                    - add $5
    Multiple stamps and rate    - add $5
    Rare rate                         - add $15
                                           --------
                                           add $30
                                           ======


Early pre-stamp covers are under-appreciated currently by the Chinese market, but once all those collectors graduate to more serious philately the market value for these is bound to sky rocket. They are very few and limited.  

My advice stamps will always be available and no need to bid them to sky rocket prices, be more careful when you buy. Under studied and under focus areas, will probably provide more material and more enjoyment than just buying another expensive Mao stamp. 

Take all the above with a bit of salt. After all I am a collector and I am speaking from a Collector's point of view. If you looking to stamps as an investment I would recommend you do this only after examining all other investment opportunities. The discouraging part of stamps a an investment is buyer's and seller's fees which are atrociously high.

Although your best guide can only be a good catalogue, in these series of articles when I give an indication of price I give the source (in many instances those of a major auction house). I believe this is perhaps the best way to indicate a price range, especially for material that is not commonly seen. For the more down to earth material I give an indication range of prices based on my own research at ebay auctions and sales.  In the end your best guide is a good stamp dealer, experienced in your area of collecting, but remember Dealer's need to provide food for their families too, so expect prices to vary.
