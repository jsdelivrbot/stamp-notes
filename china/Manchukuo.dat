Stamps and postal history
1935 Manchukuo postage stamp with image of Puyi, Emperor of Manchukuo

Manchukuo issued its first postage stamps on 28 July 1932. A number of denominations existed, with two designs: the pagoda at Liaoyang and a portrait of Puyi. Originally the inscription read (in Chinese) 
"Manchu State Postal Administration"; in 1934, a new issue read "Manchu Empire Postal Administration". An orchid crest design appeared in 1935, and a design featuring the Sacred White Mountains in 1936.

1936 also saw a new regular series featuring various scenes 
and surmounted by the orchid crest. Between 1937 and 1945, 
the government issued a variety of commemoratives: for 
anniversaries of its own existence, to note the passing of 
new laws, and to honor Japan in various ways, for instance, on 
the 2600th anniversary of the Japanese Empire in 1940. The last issue of Manchukuo came on 2 May 1945, commemorating the 10th anniversary of an edict.

After the dissolution of the government, successor postal authorities locally handstamped many of the remaining stamp stocks with "Republic of China" in Chinese and so forth. In addition, the Port Arthur and Dairen Postal Administration overprinted many Manchukuo stamps between 1946 and 1949.

<img src="http://localhost/egypt/china-stamps/dowager_master_proofs.jpg" style="width:75%"/>
<p style="font-size:smaller">

	China, 1894 Dowager Empress 60th Birthday Master die proofs, large format, 1ca. to 24ca. set of nine later lithographic prints (reprints) on cream wove paper, fine.

Provenance,
M.D. Chow

Accompanied by a letter from Wei-Liang Chow dated 14 January 1991 : "I found them among the stamps I inherited from my fatherÃ¢ï¿½Â¦ As is generally known, the large black dowager proofs come in either a thin and slightly glazed paper or a somewhat thicker and more opaque paper; the former is rarer than the latter, and probably for this reason the former proofs are considered to be more authentic in some quarters. It seems to me that both are merely lithographed prints of the original drawings of de Villard, and I do not know why the one kind is considered to be more authentic than the other."
Estimate HK$ 10,000 - 12,000
