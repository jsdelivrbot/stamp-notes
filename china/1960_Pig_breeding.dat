\section{China 1960 Pig Breeding}

As in the Soviet Union, however, investment in the 
agricultural sector was kept low relative to industrial 
investment because planners chose to achieve more rapid 
growth of basic industries. But collectivization did not 
prevent the growth of agricultural production; grain production, 
for example, increased by 3.5 percent a year under the 
First Five-Year Plan (1953-57). Growth was achieved mainly 
through the intensified use of traditional agricultural 
techniques, together with some technical improvements.

Once collectivization was achieved and agricultural output 
per capita began to increase, the leadership embarked on the 
extremely ambitious programs of the Great Leap Forward of 1958-60. 
In agriculture this meant unrealistically high production goals 
and an even higher degree of collectivization than had already 
been achieved. The existing collectives were organized very 
rapidly into people's communes, much larger units with an 
average of 5,400 households and a total of 20,000 to 30,000 
members on average. The production targets were not accompanied 
by a sufficient amount of capital and modern inputs such as fertilizer; 
rather, they were to be reached in large measure by heroic efforts 
on the part of the peasants, often beaten into submission by 
overzealous party cadres.

Substantial effort was expended during the Great Leap 
Forward on large-scale but often poorly planned capital 
construction projects, such as irrigation works and 'backyard furnaces'. 
Because of the intense pressure for results, the rapidity 
of the change, and the inexperience and resistance of many cadres 
and peasants, the Great Leap Forward soon ran into massive difficulties. 
The peasants became exhausted from the unremitting pressure to produce. 
The inflation of production statistics, on the theory that 
accuracy mattered less than political effect, resulted in 
extravagant claims. Disruption of agricultural activity and 
transportation produced food shortages. In addition, the 
weather in 1959-61 was unfavorable - though this took a minor 
role compared to governmental inefficiency and overambitious 
campaigns, and agricultural production declined sharply. By the early 
1960s, therefore, agriculture was severely depressed, with 
millions of Chinese starving due to grain requisitions by the 
government. Records show despite famine and widespread starvation
in the countryside, Beijing still denied the existence of any 
agricultural problems and continued to send grain and other food 
resources abroad to the USSR, East Germany and Albania. By 1962 
the government finally admitted defeat and China was forced to 
import grain (depite in the 1950s being a net exporter) 
to supply urban areas.

Otherwise, an excessive amount of grain would have been 
extracted from rural areas. Records differ on the extent 
of the damage caused by the Great Leap Forward, often 
because government statistics either were not taken, 
underexaggerated or were completely fabricated. However, 
the common estimate for the number of Chinese who starved, 
or were worked or beaten to death 1958-1962, agreed by several 
historians is around 45 million.
