\section{Numbering of China Stamps}


Most of the stamps of the People's Republic of China have serial
numbers printed at the bottom of the stamp. Starting in 1949 the
China Post printed the serial number on commemorative stamps and
special stamps. These serial numbers became one of characteristic
of P.R. China stamps. In the past years China has issued more than
one thousand stamp sets, but the method of number stamps has been 
changed many times through time and history. Collector's and
catalogues refer to these serial numbers such as C-series, S-series etc.


\subsection{C-headed Commemorative Stamp and S-headed Special Stamp}

The first C-headed stamp set C1 was issued on October 8th, 1949 and the 
last set C124 was issued on March 10th, 1967. 

The first S-headed stamp set S1 issued on October 10th, 1951
and the last [S75](http://127.0.0.1/CodeIgniter/index.php/Blogs/stamps/china-postal-history/1966_Women%20in%20the%20service%20trades) was issued in May 10th, 1966. 

The format of C-headed and S-headed stamp serial number is like
this, for example, C124 Learn from Heroic No. 32111, the serial
number marks as " 124.3 - 2", the Chinese word  is short for ,
means Commemorative ( is short for  means Special), "124" is the
number shows it's the 124th set of C-headed stamp, "3 - 2" means the
stamp set total has 3 item, this one is the 2nd.

And also you could find "(405)1967" on the right foot of the
stamp, it means this stamp was issued in 1967 and it's the
405th item of the whole C-headed stamp. Not all C-headed and
S-headed stamps have the mark of the issued year, C16 and before,
S5 and before have no year mark.

\section{S-series}

The S-series (for special) are similar to the C-series
(for commemorative stamps) with the exception of the chinese
characters to the left of the stamp being different, as shown below.
The stamp number in the series is again denoted to the right.

\subsection{W-headed Stamps}

W-headed stamp total has 19 stamp set, the first set W1,
Long Live Invincible Mao Zedong Thought, was issued on April
20th, 1967, the last W19, Revolutionary Youth, was issued on
January 21tn, 1970. It's the period of Chinese culture revolution,
the numbering of stamp was abolished, so you could find there're
no serial number marks on the stamp. Later these 19 stamp sets were
number as W-headed stamp.

\ph[60%]{../china/W1.jpg}{
The W-headed stamps do not bear any serial numbers,
as it happens they are amongst the most valuable and
rare stamps of the People's republic of China. The above
block was the first of the series and the block is estimated at over HKD 100,000
}


\subsection{N-headed Stamp(Stamp with Serial Numbers)}

From August 1st, 1970 since January 15th, 1973, China total issued
95 stamps, they were not classed as Commemorative or Special stamps,
just numbered with the serial number of issue, so only a number and
issued year were printed on the stamps.

###Chronological Numbering

Since 1992, all commemorative and special stamps were numbered cronologically by year and set number, looks like "1992-1(2-1)T", numbers in parenthesis indicates number - position of stamp in set, the letter T/J shows the stamp is special/commemorative.

###Regular Stamp

The first regular set was issued in 1950 and the last was issued on January 1st 2004, and the issue was continued since 1950, but no serial number was printed on regular issue. They are the equivalent of Chinese definitives. The series starts with the heavenly gate designs and continues with flowers monuments and others. They were 31 series.
