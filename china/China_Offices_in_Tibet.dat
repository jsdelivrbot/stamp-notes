##China Offices in Tibet

Given the worldwide media attention given to Tibet at present, I thought this very curious philatelic article on Tibet (originally published in The Postage Stamp October 9, 1909) might be of interest:

The Imperial Chinese Government is on the eve of establishing a postal service in Tibet, and maintaining post houses on three roads, having a centre in Lhasa, the nominal capital. Bearing in mind the recent issue of commemoratives in newly enlightened China, we must not be surprised to hear of an issue of stamps especially for that ruin of a country Tibet. We might suggest a few good illustrations that might be appropriate to the country and people of Tibet.

Scott 1-11, stamps of China 1902-1910 surcharged as shown above.
}    

For instance, Messrs. Pears might be invited to allow the use of their famous picture Since when I have used no other to depict the effigy of the Grand Lama  since the laws of the Tibetan Priesthood forbid photographs of themselves being taken. Of course, it would not do to refer to such a worldly and wicked article as soap in the holy land of Tibet. Then one value might depict a picture of the famous city, in which there are no women, nor has the step of a woman ever trod (vide Tibetan Legends). The colours of this stamp might be purple, yellow and green.

From 1909 to late 1911 China occupied Tibet and the Dalai Lama and his Government fled to India. For approximately two years, five Chinese Post Offices operated in Central Tibet and a Chinese Post Office at Chambo (Eastern Tibet) was open in 1913 and 1914.

Initially, the post office used regular stamps of Imperial China, but in 1911 a set of eleven stamps (surcharged in three languages) was introduced for Tibet (Scott #1-11). The set is very scarce and almost never sold complete. As the purchase of any overprinted stamp entails the risk of buying a fake, I recommend purchase of only those stamps in the set (including the two rare varieties) which are costly enough to justify obtaining expertization. I've listed these, along with printing quantities (when known) and Scott '10 Catalog Values for unused, below:

-1911 3p on 1c Ocher, inverted surcharge (Scott #1a; Very Rare; Scott '10 CV= $ 3,500.-)
-1911 3a on 16c Olive Green, large "S" in "Annas" (Scott #6a; Rare; Scott '10 CV= $1,250.-)
-1911 12a on 50c Yellow Green (Scott #9; 12,000; Scott '10 CV= $ 175.- )
-1911 1r on $1 Red and Pale Rose (Scott #10; 4,800; Scott '10 CV = $ 475.- )
-1911 2r on $2 Red and Yellow (Scott #11; 3,704; Scott '10 CV= $ 900.- )

The dispute between China and Tibet over the matter of Tibet's sovereignty has been ongoing for centuries, and it was following the issuance of these stamps that Tibet regained some of its autonomy and began issuing its own stamps in 1912.

I am confident that the Offices in Tibet stamps will do very well over time, mostly due to continued growth in demand for stamps of China. Interest in Tibet and its stamps may also help to push them higher.
