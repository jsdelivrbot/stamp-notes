##The 1930s

New definitives in 1931 depicted Sun Yat-sen. These stamps, along with the Martyrs issue of 1932 honoring six 
martyrs of the Kuomintang, would see much overprinting in the next several years. 1931 also saw the invasion of 
Manchuria by the Japanese and the formation of Manchukuo, which issued its own stamps
