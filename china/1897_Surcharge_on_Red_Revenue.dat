###Blocks

Blocks can be found for almost all the values, but these are rare and command large premiums over the price of
single stamps, especially if varieties can be found in these blocks.

The wrapper should have been sent by the winter mail courier service, but since it did not have the additional postage required for this, it was sent by ordinary mail and therefore took 12 days to arrive.
