##1897 3 Cents Red Revenue Stamps Surcharged for Postal Use

With the formal inauguration of the National Postal Service in the Ching Dynasty, various postal services were added, such as parcels and insured postal matters. Shortly the administration was short of higher denomintion stamps. The then current stamps had only a 24 candarins high value of the Dowager Jubilee Issue. To relieve the situation, the unused 3 cents Custom Stamps (not actual revenue stamps) kept in stock by the Statistical Department of the Maritime Customs were surcharged for postal use. Inasmuch as these stamps had never been used, there was no apprehension of their counterfeit.

LESS THAN 100 UNSURCHARGED STAMPS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE SURVIVED. 
The 3c. stamp inscribed "China" and "Revenue" was originally produced in 1896 by the London printers Waterlow \& Sons as a revenue stamp for Customs Department use, following an initial request by Sir Robert Hart, the Inspector General of the Imperial Maritime Customs, to James D. Campbell, the Customs Commissioner in London, in November 1895. The stamps were printed in sheets of 100 and perforated on three different machines and are line perforated 12-16. Waterlow & Sons shipped the 650,000 stamp order to China in September 1896. The 3c. revenue stamp was, however, never put into use, because of local opposition to the taxation scheme that the stamp was intended to serve.
At about the same time (1897), China was preparing to introduce a new silver dollar currency and a national postal service, the Imperial Post, supplanting the Customs Post, and a new definitive stamp issue reflecting these changes was ordered from printers in Japan. When the new issue was delayed because of production difficulties at the Japanese printers, the 3c. revenue stamps were surcharged by the Shanghai Customs Statistical Department as a stop gap measure in the first months of 1897 - producing the iconic and preeminent issue of Chinese stamps, the Red Revenues - as were existing stocks of the Empress Dowager issue.
A small number of the 3c. revenue stamps, though, were not surcharged, including examples which were presented to officials, as well as 761 stamps that were later transferred to the General Post Office. Of the latter, the entire stock, except for ten stamps that had been given to the Chinese Postal Museum, was tragically destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, as recounted to Dr. Chang Min-Sheng by Mr. Wu Feng Gang, a former Director of the Postal Museum. In addition, a few unsurcharged 3c. red revenues were retained by the printer Waterlow \& Sons. It is thought that less than 100 unsurcharged 3c. red revenue stamps exist today, making them a rare and important element in the red revenue issue.

The colour of these stamps is red, vermilion red, or crimson red. The perforation varies from 12 t 16 and compound. The motif dimension is 18.5 x 22.5 mm. The stamps were printed in sheets of 100. The engraved steel die had very fine gratings, being made by Waterlow and Sons, London. The total issue was 600,000 stamps. there are three values with the surcharge of small figures and five values of surcharge of large figures or characters.

The earliest values issued of these overprinted Red Revenue stamps were the dollar values. The highest value in the other 1897 Provisionals was 30c. and there was a need for dollar values for parcels, registrations and remittances.

\section{One Cent Surcharge}

On the upper part of the stamp the overprint had the Chinese characters meaning "Postal Administration of Ching Dynasty". In the middle had the characters meaning "As one cent". The middle chinese character is in large type. Each surcharge plate conssited of 25 stamps, being five to five. The overprint generated a number of varities, the "wider box" being the most famous one. It occurs on stamps Nos. 5, 15 and 16. "Short space" is another variety, on stamp No. 25, the space between the Chinese character and "one cent" is three millimeters instead of four millimeters. In some cases the ending period is missing. The one Cent Surcharge can be found on letters and wrappers see Figure\ref{wrapperredrevenues} 



\section{Two Cent Surcharge}

\ph[30%]{../china/wp133.jpg}{ }
\ph[30%]{../china/wp134.jpg}{ }


There were two types of this surcharge, one is large and the other one is small. The difference between these two kinds was that: in the large type, "2" was positioned above the word "cents" while in the small type, "2 cents" formed one line. Each surcharge plate of the stamps was 25, five by five; while for the stamps in small type, a surcharge plate consisted of 20 stamps, two vertical and ten horizontal.

The small type surcharge was poorly set. A full plate of 20 stamps showing many varieties: in stamps No. 1, "n" was broken; in stamps No. 5 the period was displaced by a comma after "cents"; In stamps No. 13, the period was sometimes missing after "cents"; and in stamps No. 15, "s" was inverted. Other varities also exist such as inverted overprint, double overprint, and a combination of both.

\section{4 Cents Surcharge}

The 4 cents surcharges also were of teo types; the large type and the small type. The small type is considered to be a printing proof. Because the small figure was not easily discernible the large type was used afterwards. The surcharge plates were the same as for the 2 cents surcharge. In stamps No. 13 od both the small and large types of 4 cents surcharge, the Chinese character was also broken at the top left corner. The figure "4" is rather different in these two types. The small type, being less in quantity, is rather rare. That with the double overprint is a very rare variety.

\section{Small Surcharge as 1 Dollar}

This stamp is considered as one of the rarest Chinese stamps. On teh upper part it was also overprinted "Postal Administration of Ching Dynasty" in four Chinese characters; and in the middle were vertically overprinted "As one dollar" in three Chinese characters. As these three chinese characters were too small the larger type replaced them afterwards. It was alleged that only two sheets of 40 stamps had made their appearance. But this could not be verified. There are two varieties of this stamp. One is the "no stop after dollar" and the other is "period with wider space after 'dollar'".

A block of four of this stamp is known as the rarest item among the Chinese stamps. It was first in the hand of Mr. R. A. de Villard. He sold it in 1920 to Mr. M. D. Chow at a price of 2500 taels of silver. Then Mr. Chow sold it to Mr. Allen Gokson in 1947 for a price of 330 ounces of gold. ($20,000 US currency at the time). It was sold in 1982 to Mr. Lam Man Yin, from Hong Kong for a reported price of $280,000. 

\section{Large Surcharge as 1 Dollar}

The Chinese characters at the top of the stamp resembled those in the 2 cents and 4 cents large surcharges. The three vertical characters in the middle were bigger in size than those in the small surcharge mentioned previously. Each surcharge plate consists of 25 stamps, being five to five. As the types used in the surcharging this stamp were somewhat different from each other, it is possible to make a reconstructed sheet from 25 different copies of this stamp.

##The $5 surcharge

The top horizontal row is the same as those for the $1 stamps of the issue. Ma mentions without quoting the source that the stamaps printed were only 5000 and that they were all used up, laregly on drafts. The drafts had to be returned to Head Office when the drafts were cashed and hence very few used copies survived. The used copies especially with postal cancellations are considered rarer than the mint copies. This stamp is known with the urcharge inverted; the ratio of rarity of the inverted surcharge against the normal one is about 1 to 3.
