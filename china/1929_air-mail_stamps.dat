\chapter{1929 Air Stamps}

After the establishment of the national Government of China at Nanking, the old five-bar flag of China was abandoned and the new flag of a white sun and blue sky on red background was to be used. The Chinese Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Peking was ordered to print a new set of air mail stamps which is identical in all respects to the First Issue except the insignia on the tail of the airplane was changed to the white sun and blue sky design.
