 To commemorate the 5th International Student's Union Congress in Beijing , the Stamp Issuing Bureau planned to issue a set of commemorative stamps on September 4, 1958; the values in set was 2; the serial number was: C54; the face values were 8 fen (purple) and 22 fen (green), the design was the emblem of the Congress. The emblem consisted of the number "5", the Earth, the torch and the book; under the emblem was the rostrum of Tian An Men with the year of "1958" printed on the rostrum. On the stamp, it printed "The 5th International Students Congress". Several days before the issue, however, the authorities found out that the congress which was organized by the International Student's Union should be entitled "The 5th International Student's Union Congress". The title on the issued stamps was not correct; the issue of the stamps must be cancelled and new dies must be made. The stamps had been distributed to the post offices, and several post offices had started to sell the stamps in advance. So a very limited number of the errors went to private collections.
