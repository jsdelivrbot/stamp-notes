After the memorial building project was completed they were dedicated to Tan Yen Kai on January 9, 1933. On the same date, a set of commemorative stamps of four values were issued. The stamps were printed by the Chinese Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Peking, in sheets of 100 (10 x 10). The set was on sale until July 1, 1933 and was valid for postage until the end of the same year. These stamps were overprinted, but only for Sinkiang and Yunnan Provinces, as Manchuria was then invaded by Japanese and these stamps were never overprinted for use in Manchuria. The stamps were perforated 14 and printed on unwatermarked paper.
