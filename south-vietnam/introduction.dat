South Vietnam (1954-1976)

1971 South Vietnam stamp.
The stamps of South Vietnam were mostly printed in Paris, Tokyo, England (by De La Rue) and Rome during 1954-67,[6] in Japan during 1967-73[7] and in England (by De La Rue) during 1973-75.[8]

Stamps used by military personnel were printed locally[9] and are of inferior quality.

Between 1963 and 1976, the insurgent National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (the NLF or "Viet Cong") issued their own stamps. These were printed in Hanoi.[10] When the Republic of Vietnam was toppled in May 1975, the NFL government became the sole stamp issuing authority, until the reunification of Vietnam one year later.
