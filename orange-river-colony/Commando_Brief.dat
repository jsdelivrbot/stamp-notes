## Orange River Colony - The VRI Overprints

The "Commando Brief" frank was used during the second Boer War (1899-1900) by members of the OFS forces on active duty. Originally, the requirement for letters to pass through the OFS field post system was that they be initialled by the Commanding Officer of the unit the soldier belonged to. Before long, the volume of mail seems to have become large enough that this 
was causing problems, and this frank came into existence.

The frank was designed by A. Hochapfel, 
a Bloemfontein chemist, and was printed by Curling & Co. 
of Bloemfontein in black on yellow paper, laid out in sheets of 
20 comprising 5 columns and 4 rows. The sheets were then line perforated 12. 
There is evidence that each row was printed separately. 
In addition, it is possible to identify which position in the row any particular 
frank comes from, as there are relatively large differences between the five dies used.

s relatively few sheets were printed, and as the frank was not in use for very long, 
examples are reasonably uncommon. 
Blocks of franks in particular are very rare. 

According to Rich3, most of the unused copies in existence were taken from General 
Piet Cronje's camp when it was captured by the British during their advance north 
through the Orange Free State. The illustration below shows a 
partially reconstructed sheet, complete except for the two lower position 3 stamps.


About fifty covers are known.
