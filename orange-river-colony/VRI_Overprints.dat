###The V.R.I. Overprints

With the entering of {{wi:Frederick_Roberts,_1st_Earl_Roberts}} British forces into Bloemfontein in the {{wi:Orange_Free_State}} in March 1900, the stamps of the OFS were overprinted with V.R.I. (_Victoria Regina Imperatrix_).

The existing stock was seized by the British and were surcharged by Curling & Co., in Bloemfontein. The stocks of republican postgae stamps found in the Treasury were supplemented by small quantities brought in from various post offices at different times, especially during the occupation of the northern half of the country during May 1900. The stamps comprised all values of the definitive issue in the current colours and the 2 1/2 d provisional of 1896. None of the obsolete 1/2 d chestnut, 1d brown or 1/- orange yellow were available, but the stocks included the obscolescent 6d carmine and the unissued 6d blue.


The war conditions and the poor local printing has produced some of the most interesting and affordable varieties. Luckily large blocks survive making the job of identifying the position of constant and non-constant varieties easier.

It is generally agreed that three printings took place which are easily identifiable.

####First Printing
The first one has the stops and bottom of V.R.I level. (Normally known to collectors as 'level stops').

The postage and telegraph stamps were in conventional De La Rue sheets of 240, divided into four panes of 60 stamps. Curling's press was wide enough to take two panes side by side, but not deep enough to take two panes one above the other. He could therefore have used a  setting of 120 units to print a half a sheet at the time, but in fact he used a setting of 60 to overpint one pane at each opeartion, perhaps because there was not enough stock of type with the same font.

####Second Printing
The Second printing has the stops raised above the level of the bottom of the letters.

After the initial requirements of postage stamps has been printed from the first setting the type was re-arranged
to print first revenue stamps and then telegraph stamps before a demand for further supplies of postage stamps led to the printings from the Second Postage Setting. At the end of the Second Setting the stocks of 2 1/2 d, 4d and 6 d carmine sheets available for overprinting had been exhausted.


####Third Printing
The third printing has the levels raised and a somewhat thicker 'V'. You can see the difference easily, if you place them side by side.

It has been impossible to establish with certainty the fate of the type after the Second Printing, but it is clear that the setting underwent a radical change at this point. Whatever the cause, when further postage printings were called for, the type included seven letters from a different font - the so called 'thick V'. One of the 'thick V' pieces quickly suffered damage and was replaced by the normal 'V', but the remaining six persisted through all the subsequent printings. All stops were raised.
