\ph[70%]{../cilicia/311.jpg}{311 Yvert #45, 1919 1pi Blue with 
cursive "Cilicie" overprint, two examples, one without the overprint 
tied along with five other stamps by Deurt-Yol 26.5.19 c.d.s. postmarks 
on cover to Conseil d'Administration Central de L'Union Generale Armenienne

Deurt-Yol was occupied by French troops supported by Armenian collaborators.
