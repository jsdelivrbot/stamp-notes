##Sudan - Postal History


In the dying years of the nineteenth century, Great Britain was attempting to overthrow the Mahdist regime of Sudan. Sudan had been controlled for many years by the Mahdi, who had defeated and killed General Gordon following the Siege of Khartoum in 1884 and 1885, but the British had returned and, by the late 1890s, had all but subjugated the country. In charge of the British forces in Sudan was Sir Herbert Kitchener, later to become Lord Kitchener, and as his grip on Sudan increased he began to look to administrative matters.

Sudan must have its own postage stamps, rather than use those of Egypt, and Sir Herbert commenced the process of obtaining a suitable design. A well-known artist travelling in the region at the time was asked to submit a design, but his depiction of the rock temple at Abu Simbel was not utilized. It is not known whether the design was rejected because Abu Simbel was located in an area that could be claimed by the Egyptians or because the artist demanded payment of twenty-five guineas. However, having rejected this particular solution to his problem, Sir Herbert called upon the services of Captain E. A. Stanton.

In 1897 Captain Stanton was stationed with General Macdonald's Sudanese Brigade at Korti in the province of Dongala. His duties included surveying and mapping the region. Being an amateur artist and finding himself with time on his hands, he took to drawing illustrations of oases, wells, and points of interest in the margins of the maps he was helping to create. These pen-and-ink sketches came to the attention of Sir Herbert, who made a point of meeting Captain Stanton on his next visit to Korti.

On meeting Captain Stanton, Kitchener ordered him to provide a design for a postage stamp and promptly gave Stanton a generous five days to complete the design. Inspiration eluded Stanton for several days, until the regiment's mail was delivered by camel instead of the usual river steamer. As well as being a map-maker, Stanton was also the liaison officer for the local tribesmen, which included the Howawir tribe. Therefore, he was able to prevail on the Sheikh of the Howawir tribe to don his war kit and mount his camel, so that he could draw his inspired image of the Camel Postman. In order to make the camel appear to be on a postal run, bags filled with chopped straw were attached to the saddle to imitate mailbags. Stanton then drew the sketch of the Sheikh riding through the desert and added the names of Khartoum and Berbera, two towns in Sudan, to the mailbags.

To Stanton's great relief, Sir Herbert accepted his drawing and, in March 1898, postage stamps prepared by Thomas de la Rue with Stanton's illustration were issued at Berber. The 'Camel Postman' continued to be used on Sudan's postage stamps for the next fifty years, although other designs were periodically utilized. When Sudan prepared its first banknotes, the Camel Postman was chosen to adorn the back of the notes.
