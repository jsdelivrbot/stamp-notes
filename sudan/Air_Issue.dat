\chapter{Air Issue}    
In 1931, air mail was introduced into the Sudan, by Imperial Airways, initially using the 'camel' issue - 5 and 10 milliemes and 2 piastres values were overprinted \textsc{airmail} - before a dedicated air mail issue was introduced later that year. Prior to regular airmail service, a series of experimental and trial flights took place by the Frenchman Marc Pourpe (1913-14), the Air Ministry (1919), Sir Alan Cobham who carried out an African Survey flight in 1925-26, the RAF (1925, 1926 \& 1927) and the Norh Sea Aerial \& General Transport Limited who carried out a series of pioneer flights in 1927.

Preliminary material for the airmail series exists in the the form of unadopted and adopted essays, proofs and trials.
