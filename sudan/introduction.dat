##Sudan - Postal History


The postal history of the Sudan is largely determined by its geographical location and its history. Sudan is a large country of some 1,000,000 square miles, through which runs the River Nile; the White Nile, rising in Ugunda, joins the Blue Nile, from Ethiopia, between Omdurman and Khartoum. West of the Nile, the country is largely a desert; much of the northern part of the Sudan, east of the Nile is also desert with scrub land.       

Little is known of the Sudan before its conquest by Egypt in 1820 and when the modern history of the Sudan starts. Muhammed Ali, the then Turkish Pasha of Egypt, invaded the country, bringing under his control a principal channel of the slave trade. Muhammad Ali's conquest was achived with little bloodshed, and the Pasha presented himeself as a mild and accessible administrator.

The Equatorial and Bahr-el-Gazal provinces postal arrangements are very good. There is a weekly post, and letters travel with
perfect safety and regularity. Generally two soldiers and a dragoman carry the letters, which are fastened in a small
leather bag. The men walk in single file, the bag being carried by the man in the middle.
