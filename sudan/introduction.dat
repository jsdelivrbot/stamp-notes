###History
         

Little is known of the Sudan before its conquest by Egypt in 1820.
By 1850 the Egyptian influence
had extended to 120 miles south of Khartoum.

###1861

In 1861, Sir {{wi:Samuel_Baker}} was commissioned by the Khedive Ismail Pasha to stamp out the 
oppression extortion and slavery on which Egyptian rule was based and also to extend 
Egyptian influence to the equatorial regions of the Sudan.

###Postal history

The first Sudanses post offices to be operated _under the Egyptians_ were 
at __Suakim__ and __Waidi Halfa__ in 1867. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 enabled letters
to reach Suakim more speedily and letters addressed to Khartoum were sent from there via Berber. In 1873 offices were established at Dongola, Berber and Khartoum,
followed in 1877 by those at Sennar, Karkouk, Fazogulu, Elkedaref (Gaderef), El Obeid, El Fasher and Fashoda (Kodok)
and later at Kasala and Massawa.

###1885 Suakim Expedition

British 2 1/2d. and 5d. and British Military Telegraph stamps were used in the 1885 Suakim Expedition.
and contemporary Indian stamps up to about 1889; the latter by the contigent that remained when the abandoned expedition of 1885 was
withdrawn.

An army intelligence Department report in 1884, states:

<blockquote>

The Equatorial and Bahr-el-Gazal provinces postal arrangements are very good. There is a weekly post, and letters travel with
perfect safety and regularity. Generally two soldiers and a dragoman carry the letters, which are fastened in a small
leather bag. The men walk in single file, the bag being carried by the man in the middle.
