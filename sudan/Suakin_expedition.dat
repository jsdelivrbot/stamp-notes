\chapter{Suakin Dongola Expedition}    
The Suakin Expedition refers to two military expeditions led by Major-General Sir Gerald Graham V.C. to Suakin in Sudan with the intention of destroying the power of Osman Digna, the first in February 1884 and the second in March 1885.
The first expedition [edit]

The first expedition, in February 1884, led to several notable British victories (the Second Battle of El Teb and the Battle of Tamai).[1][2]


Following the fall of Khartoum, Graham led a second expedition in March 1885[3] and although it was successful in the two actions it fought (the Battle of Tofrek and the Battle of Hasheen),[4] it failed to change the military situation and was withdrawn.[5]
