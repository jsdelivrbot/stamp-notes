# Introduction to the Postage Stamps and Postal History of Greenland

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Greenland.
Greenland is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark, located between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

\section{First stamps}

The first stamps of Greenland were parcel stamps issued in 1905. The first postage stamps of Greenland were issued on 1 December 1938

Greenland is, in this respect, still quite unique
in that our geographical location on the globe and
our special infrastructure – where, for example,
the absence of a road system between our cities
- provides unique logistical challenges. In addition,
regular air traffic to and from Greenland still only
operates on certain days of the week and only
rarely at weekends. Shipping traffic is, therefore,
well developed in Greenland, making it possible to
choose between a ship or aircraft when passengers,
cargo - and post – need to be transported to
and from Greenland and around our large, sprawling
country.

Consequently, shipping and aviation have had
and still provide very important opportunities for
POST Greenland to deliver the mail, in Greenland
and to and from abroad.

The Greenland Post Office was established in
1938, after which date the use of Danish stamps
was gradually replaced by new Greenlandic stamps.
Our Office has, since its early and sometimes difficult
start, evolved into a modern postal service,
with a number of exciting stamp issues behind it,
each one with strings recording Greenland’s fascinating
history.

1938 - 2013: From the first Greenlandic
stamps to today

On 17th September 1938 a notice No. 326 was
forwarded, which was published in the Official
Gazette on 31st October 1938. By Executive Order,
inter alia, “From this provision it comes into force
that the assessors of Greenland’s Governing post
record that messages sent from Greenland to Denmark
and abroad shall be stamped with Greenland
stamps”.

With effect from December 1st 1938 The
Greenland Post Office became a member of The
Universal Postal Union. The Postal Service’s sales
office for stamp collectors, Bernstorffgade 32,
Copenhagen K, started selling the new Greenlandic
stamps on 1st December 1938.

The first stamp series of The Greenland Post
Office were housed in a presentation folder which
was handed out during the UPU Congress in
Buenos Aires on 23rd May 1939. The front of the
folder showed a picture of King Christian X, greeting
Greenland’s population during the first royal
visit in 1921.

The stamps were issued in denominations of 1,
5, 7, 10 and 15 ore bearing the image of Christian
X and 0.30 kroner and 1.00 Danish krone featuring
the design of a polar bear. These are the motifs of
the sovereign and the polar bear which have formed
the basis for the stamps in whole sheets and
souvenir sheets now created by Bertil Skov Jørgensen
as a distinguished commemoration of the 75th
anniversary of The Greenland Post Office.

The issue of these first Greenlandic stamps in
1938 has since been followed
by over 500 stamps, each of
which reflects the development
of Greenland, its history,
nature and culture, from Independence,
culture in prehistoric
times, right up to today’s modern
Greenland.

POST Greenland is very pleased that today we
have collectors in all parts of the world. In recent
years, we have even had the pleasure to welcome
new collectors in China into the collector circuit.
It makes us proud that people across the globe
take an interest in what we are featuring on our
stamps. We take pride in the fact that every time
we issue new stamps we tell a new and unique
story of Greenland.
