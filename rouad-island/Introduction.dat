\chapter{Ruad Island} 

Arwad (Arabic: أرواد‎; Biblical Hebrew: אַ‏רְוָ‏ד, Arvad) – formerly known as Arado (Greek: Άραδο), Arados (Greek: Άραδος), Arvad, Arpad, Arphad, and Antiochia in Pieria (Greek: Αντιόχεια της Πιερίας), also called Ruad Island – located in the Mediterranean Sea, is the only inhabited island in [Syria](../syria/introduction). The town of Arwad takes up the entire island. It is located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) from Tartus (anciently Tortosa), Syria's second largest port. Today, it is mainly a fishing town. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Arwad had a population of 4,403 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of the Arwad nahiyah ("subdistrict") of 
which it is the only locality.\cite{General Census of Population and Housing 2004. Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Latakia Governorate. (Arabic)}. 
Its inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslims.[2]

 Therefore, it is not suprising that Arwad was a strategic island in World War 1. Ile Rouad was the was the first point of French occupation in the Middle East, as on 1 Sept. 1915, the island was taken by the French Navy cruiser Jeanne d’Arc. Originally Arwad was occupied in order to materially support the Maronite Christians who were being oppressed by the Turks in Lebanon, and as an intelligence center. (There had been massacres of Christians in the Ottoman Empire in May 1915 and then there was a severe famine in Lebanon due to the war.) As the war was winding to a close, the allies begin using Rouad as a staging area to the Middle East, and for the taking of Damascus on 1 Oct. 1918. Ile Rouad is attached to the French portion of the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration in 1919, and on 20 Sept, 1920 the islet became part of the Alaouites (Alawite State). It is now part of Syria.
