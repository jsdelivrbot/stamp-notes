\chapter{Introduction}

The  meeting-place of the British Lion and the Chinese
Dragon in northern China consists of the port and
Territory of Weihaiwei.

After Russia leased Port Arthur (130 kilometres (81 mi) across the Yellow Sea near modern-day Dalian) from China for 25 years in March 1898, the United Kingdom obtained a lease for Weihaiwei. This lease was to be in force as long as the Russians occupied Port Arthur. In 1905, the Japanese defeated the Russians in the Russo-Japanese War and the Japanese took over Port Arthur. The British lease was extended as long as the Japanese occupied Port Arthur. The British agreed to return the city to China in 1930. Weihaiwei was thus a British leased territory from 1898 until October 1, 1930. It was a summer station for the British naval China Station and it was also used as a health resort. It served as a port of call for ships of the Royal Navy in the Far East (well behind Hong Kong in the south).

British "blue ensign" of Weihai
At the beginning of the lease, the territory was administered by a Senior Naval Officer of the Royal Navy (Sir Edward Hobart Seymour). In 1899, administration was transferred to a military and civil commissioner (Arthur Robert Ford Dorward 1899–1901 and John Dodson Daintree 1901–1902) appointed by the War Office in London. The territorial garrison consisted of 200 British troops and a specially constituted Chinese Regiment with British officers. In 1901, it was decided that this base should not be fortified, and administration was transferred to the U.K.'s Colonial Office. The Chinese Regiment was disbanded in 1903.

A Civil Commissioner was appointed in 1902 to administer the territory. The post was held by Sir James Haldane Stewart Lockhart until 1921. After Lockhart, Arthur Powlett Blunt (1921–1923) and Walter Russell Brown (1923–1927) were appointed Commissioners in Weihaiwei. The last Commissioner was the outstanding sinologist Reginald Johnston (previously tutor to the last Chinese emperor) who served from 1927 to 1930.

In 1909, the Hong Kong governor Sir Frederick Lugard, proposed that Britain return Weihaiwei to Chinese rule and, in return, receive perpetual rule of the New Territories of Hong Kong which had also been leased in 1898. This proposal was never adopted.[1]
Weihaiwei was not developed in the way that Hong Kong and other British colonies in the region were. This was because Shandong Province, of which Weihaiwei was part, was inside Germany's (and after World War I Japan's) sphere of influence. It was normal practice for British colonies to be administered under the provisions of the British Settlements Act 1887. However, Weihaiwei was actually administered under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act 1890 which was the law which granted extraterritorial powers over British subjects in China and other countries where Britain had extraterritorial rights. The reason for this was that as a leased territory, subject to rendition at any time, it was not considered appropriate to treat Weihaiwei as a full colony.

No special postage stamps were ever issued for Weihaiwei. Just as in the treaty ports, Hong Kong stamps were used. From 1917, these were overprinted with the word CHINA. Despite this, the city did have its own revenues from 1921 onwards. There were also never any special coins or banknotes issued for circulation in Weihaiwei. The various currencies in circulation in China at the time were used.

The nickname British sailors gave to this port was "Way High"; it was also sometimes referred to as Port Edward in English.
