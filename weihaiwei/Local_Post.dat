\chapter{Courier Post}
WHEN first the territory of Wei-hai-Wei was taken over
by the British in 1898 no arrangements were made to
establish a post office, either on the island of Liu-kungtao
or on the mainland itself. In consequence of this
the mails for the residents and garrison were sent by
the postal authorities to the nearest Chinese post office,
viz. that of Chifu, and there they remained till one of H.M. ships could call

for them. In the same way the letters from Wei-hai-Wei were taken by one
of H.M. ships to Chifu and there posted.

This arrangement naturally caused considerable delay, and although Chifu
is only fifty-six miles distant by road from Wei-hai-Wei, mails often lay there
for a week or ten days before they were called for.

In order to do away with this inconvenience, some of the residents of Liukung-
tao obtained the Commissioner's permission to try to start a courier
post in conjunction with the postal authorities at Chifu, and in order to pay
for these couriers his sanction was also obtained for issuing a sufficient
number of 2 cent and 5 cent stamps to cover the expenses.

This courier post was started in the beginning- of December, 1898, and as
it was found impossible to print stamps at Wei-hai-Wei itself, Messrs. Kelly
and Walsh, of Shanghai, were asked to print 4,000 2 cent and 4,000 5 cent
stamps, as it was thought that this number would be required during the first
six months.

Over a month elapsed before these stamps arrived, and during that time
a provisional issue was made by stamping Messrs. Cornabe and Co.'s "dollar
chop " on the " dark room " paper belonging to one of the officers.
The post was successfully run till April, 1899, when the Chinese Imperial
Post decided to start a post office at Wei-hai-Wei, and took over the couriers.
A British post office was established on Liu-kung-tao in or about
September, 1899.

During the time that the courier post ran, about 850 2 cent and 300 5 cent
stamps of the provisional issue, and 4,000 2 cent and 4,000 5 cent stamps of
the " Shanghai" issue, were struck. Of these $50 worth of the 5 cent stamps
were in hand when the post was stopped, and these were sold to a dealer in
Shanghai.

The addressee, Jas. Silverthorne, was the only listed employee of L.H. Smith & Co. in "The Chronicle and Directory for China, Japan, Coreaâ€¦" for 1898 and 1899. There was also a J. Silverthorne on the staff of Cornabe and Co. merchants in Chefoo in 1898 and for the renamed Cornabe, Eckford and Co. merchants in 1899.
There are two other almost identical covers from the same correspondence : one dated Dec. 1898 (Ryohei Ishikawa, Sotheby's London, 5.12.80, lot 635), and the other dated 7 Jan. 1899 (Frederick and Tomiko Bartlett, Christie's Swire, 30.9.92, lot 1886).


The 2 cent stamps were used for letters, the 5 cent stamps being used for
parcels.

It is noticed that Messrs. Stanley Gibbons catalogue the courier post in
Part III. of their Catalogue. As, however, the post ran from British into
Chinese territory, it is a question whether it would come under a heading of
a local post.

Be this as it may, it should in any case be considered as a genuine post,
supplying as it did a much-felt want, and bringing Wei-hai-Wei within a
week of Shanghai, instead of three weeks as was previously the case.
