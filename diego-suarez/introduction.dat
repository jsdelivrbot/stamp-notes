## Diego Suarez

Diego-Suarez is a city at the northern tip of [Madagascar](../madagascar/introduction) in Antsiranana province. It was a French colony in the late 19th century until it was returned to Madagascar in 1896. It was renamed as Antsiranana in 1975.

The colony issued its own postage stamps from 1890 to 1894, managing to produce over 60 types in that short time.
