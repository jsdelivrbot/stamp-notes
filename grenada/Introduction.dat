# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Grenada

Grenada is an island country in the British Commonwealth consisting of the island of Grenada and six smaller islands at the southern end of the Grenadines in the southeastern Caribbean Sea. Grenada is located northwest of Trinidad and Tobago, northeast of Venezuela, and southwest of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

 
## First stamps

The first stamps of Grenada were issued on 3 June 1861 in the values of 1 penny (green) and 6 pence (rose).


## Modern Issues

Modern issues have a topical bias, with too many miniature sheets and inappropriate themes. The birds issues are quite colorfull and always popular.
