\chapter{Cambodia}

Cambodia used the postage stamps of [Indo-China](../indo-china/Introduction) until the early 1950s. In 1949 Cambodia became an associated state of the French Union but gained independence in 1953 and left the Union in 1955.

Khmer Rouge era

The Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia in 1975. The new regime allowed no civilian private communication and so abolished the postal system. Service resumed in early 1979 when the Vietnamese army drove Khmer Rouge out of the capital Phnom Penh.

\subsection{Liberation}

1980 saw the first set of postage stamps issued after liberation.
