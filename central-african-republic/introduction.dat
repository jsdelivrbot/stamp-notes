# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of the Central Africa Republic


The Central African Republic has been issuing stamps as an independent nation since 1959. Before this, it was formerly the [Ubangi-Shari](../ubangi-shari/Introduction). The first issue in 1959 with RÃ©publique centrafricaine included a depiction of President Boganda.

From December 4, 1976 to 1979, the country was renamed the Central African Empire when President Bokassa became emperor. It issued stamps labelled as Empire Centrafricaine, although the first five issues in 1977 under the empire were overprints of the Central African Republic.

The Central African Republic returned to producing its stamps under this national title in 1979, beginning with an issue celebrating the 1980 Winter Olympic Games.
