\section{1937 (December 29th) Constitution Day}    

After a gap of over 3 years, the next issue was released finally. 3 months earlier the new high values of Saint Patrick had been released, but these were parts of the Definitive set and are discussed under the Definitves issues. However this original printing of se watermark versions ranks amongst the most scarce of non error/non overprinted Irish stamps, being the region of several hundred dollars a set.

A plebiscite held on July 1 1937 had a 56% result for a new constitution. In it Ireland changed its name from the "Irish Free State" to "Eire" and they managed to establish the presidency (Taoiseach), although there is debate over whether the English monarchy had been given the heave ho or not. Certainly British rulers were not referred to any post 1921 stamp (Although overprints were used until 1937 with Seahorse high values).

This constitution also gave the Irish state, president and parliament (Dail Eireann) sweeping powers and the people their rights. It was a landmark proclamation, and incredibly did not establish the Roman Catholic church as a forced religion, but did require people to be in one (The Church of Ireland (Anglican) was listed as the second major religious group though).

It did also not apply to the part of Ireland that was part of the United Kingdom (Ulster). The constitution was enacted the day the stamps were issued - December 29th 1937.

This set was reissued in different colours in 1958 for the 21st anniversary. It is easy to tell these apart from these earlier stamps.
