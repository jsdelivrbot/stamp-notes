Again this was another Roman Catholic anniversary, this time a year to celbrate and understand Mariology  :shock: by Pope Pius XII. It was a propagation of the cult of the virgin Mary.

Neither of these two are scarce, but the design is quite bright and these are overrall pleasant stamps, another Stampboarder has used this issue as a focus for studying Irish village postmarks.

Because the stamps are large and both rates can appear on local mail, it is popular in this regard.
