Issue 50 - 16 Aug 1965 - International Co - Operation Year


3d - Dark Blue and Purple - International Co operation year symbol showing clasped hands surrounded by a Laurel wreath, inscription in Gaelic. 20 million
10d - As above but brown and purple - 500,000

Designer and Printed by Stamping Branch, Revenue department of Irish Post Office, Photgravure.

A rather non descript issue for the 50th commemorative set of Irish stamps issued, it had taken 36 years for 50 issues and 15 of them had been in the past 5 years. This was another global omnibus issue popular in the 1960s.

It is innovative in the sense, Ireland had now really become part of the global village rather than being completely insular as it had up to a few years ago. Had International Co operation year taken place in 1955, theres almost no way the Irish would have issued a set of stamps, and if it had happened after 1995, there would have been several stamps and a minisheet  :lol: 

This shows a real halfway point, its also significant as the numbers printed of the higher value are very low (500k) and actually the lowest for a commem so far and at least until the 1980s. Yet its relatively cheap at 1 Pound. The values too are also bizarre 10d which I think is sea mail to most of the world or the USA and 3d which was the local second class surface/unsealed rate.
