Robert Emmet was a young Protestant Irish man who always had sympathy for Irish home rule, he was involved with the Wolfe Tone Rebellion was a skilled orator. His own failed uprising in 1803 resulted in him being executed for Treason by the British. He was another young gifted Patriot 

The Emmet issue was produced in sheets of 120, divided into two panes of 60 subjects with a gutter between them. Each pane consists of 60 stamps arranged 10 across by 6 down. At the top of the stamp appears in the national language the name of the state Eire (Ireland). Below Eire, and at the extreme left, is the patriot's name. The centenary dates appear directly under his name.

Printing was done by Messrs De La Rue and Co., at the plant of their Irish subsidiary, Brown & Nolan, Ltd., Clonskeagh, Dublin. The recess process (engravure) method of printing was used in producing the stamps on paper watermarked "E." Perforations are 13 x 13.
The stamp issue is again interesting, the colours and design are strong and like the past two issues, the country name has returned to Eire. The low value of 3d is surprisingly pricey at 3 pounds for a mint example, but the high value is the highest catalogued non error or variety for a commemorative.

For some unknown reason, Gibbons has it at 45 Pounds mint, which is a lot for such an item. It increased from 42 Pounds last year. Even a used example is at 18 pounds. One guess maybe was it was for an overseas airmail rate and there was not a value in the definitive set at this new rate in 1953. 

The definitives at the time went from 1/- to 2/6 with no gap. A set of airmails started in 1948, but a new design for the 1/3 did not arrive until December 1954, and it possible that the 1/3 Emmet stamp served until the airmail stamp was released, hence making copies of it mint or used fairly scarce. This gave the stamp some 15 months of use and thus why nearly 3 million were issued (High for such a high value stamp).
