A true Irish Polymath who was active in Astronomy, Physics and other science beside mathematics, he devised the theory of Quaternions in 1843 (He also appears on stamps in 1983 - theory only and in 2005) a form of fourth dimension algebra iused in solving geometrical problems. Born 1805 died 1865. He was a scholar at Trinity College Dublin.
