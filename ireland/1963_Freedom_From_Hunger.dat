Part of the FAO initiative (Food and Agriculture Organisation - United Nations) a global campaign against ending world hunger happened in 1963, nearly every country in the world issued a stamp or two with this topic. The Irish stamps were an independent job, but the British commonwealth had a huge omnibus series designed by Michael Goaman. 

Not many 1st world countries issued these stamps (Most BC ones were colonies and poorer nations). More here - https://sites.google.com/a/freedomfromh ... r-campaign

This was the first issue at 4d local postage, this rate would only last 3 years, before another increase. Its the last issue to have weird printing numbers, starting with the next issue, the numbers issued were round figures.
