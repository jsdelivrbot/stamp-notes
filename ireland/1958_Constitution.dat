Issue 34 : 29 Dec 1958 - 21st anniversary of the Irish Constitution

3d - Same as 1937 Stamps (Issue 7) but this is Rembrandt Brown in colour, scribe by book saying "We the people" in Gaelic - 25,704,840

5d - As above but in green - 940,140

Designer R. L. King and Typographed (E watermark)

A good example of keeping a classic design going! Exactly the same as the 1937 stamps except the colour and value changes and of course a different watermark. Released 21 years later to the day, but if you look close, these appear to be slightly sharper and more professional looking than the originals.

These were also the last typographed commemorative stamps ever to be issued. All would be recess printed and even photogravured from now on.
