Daniel O' Connell was known as the Liberator as he was responsible for being the first Catholic MP in Parliament at Westminster since the 1600s. He was also Lord Mayor of Dublin and is revered as a hero of Liberation to the Irish people (The inscription in Gaelic refers to him as a Liberator). His most important achievement took place was in 1829 in which Roman Catholicism was officially tolerated in the British empire again and Catholics could now enter public office and worship and build in their own churches.

Between the mid 1500s and 1829, Catholics were banned and until 1685 and between 1689 and 1829 discrimination was entrenched and even being one could mean your death in Anglican and the Puritan England of the mid 1600s. In the 18th century it eased off, but the Gordon Riots in London in 1780 proved how much Catholics were still despised. Some 90% of the Irish population was Roman Catholic hence the importance of this deed.

This set came after only 7 years since the first stamps had been issued, and was a bold first step in this regard. As you will see the next few sets do not quite keep up it with it in quality and scope.
