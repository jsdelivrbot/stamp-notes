St Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland and responsible for bringing Christianity to Ireland as well as banishing the snakes (Apparently) and he was also responsible for the rash of monastery building and the creation of celtic christianity. 

March 17th is his day which unfortunately has become a day to express more negative and derivative aspects of Irish culture (Getting drunk) mostly on Irish stout like Kilkenny and Guinness, Its doubtful if St. Patrick drank himself, and the usual stereotypes of jigging, shamrocks, leprechauns, pots of gold, spindly celtic art, Irish fiddle and drumtype music, riverdancing, listening to Westlife and words like Begorrah all come out on this day.

There are parades and in America, some people even dye rivers green (They did in Chicago in 2011, but in 2012, it was still frozen as March is still winter in the chill northern cities), Its a day to celebrate all things Irish, but the stereotypes get out of hand  :roll: (The Family guy episode (Peters Two Dads, Season 6 2006), where Peter meets his Irish father Mickey McFinn is a hoot though - they lad at the airport whose runway is covered in beer bottles  :lol: ).

More here, although, this is a bit dogmatic and rose tinted glasses.

The issue itself is quite good, it does not look as heavy and overdone as earlier religious issues like 1950 Holy Year. It still shows that Religion was super important in Ireland in the early 1960s, the 8d had the lowest printing in te set and thus is worth the same as the 1/3 (3.50 pounds).
