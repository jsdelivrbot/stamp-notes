Thomas Moore was the author of Irish melodies and yet another Patriotic Author of the early 19th century - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Moore

The issue is interesting as it was a De La Rue printed one and the high value 3.5d did not represent any real rate. I suspect it was a 2oz local letter, as postage was 2.5d for the first ounce and 1d for each additional ounce. Because of this the 3.5d is not as scarce as other high values and costs only marginally more than the low value.
