CEPT stands for European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administations) part of Europa, the member states had a joint issue of stamps annually. It started in 1956 with 5 countries and over time, more have joined. The UK and Ireland both joined in 1960 and apart from 1961, Ireland has issued a Europa issue each year.

Until 1974, the designs were designed by one designer in a member country and this design was used on all the member states issues as part of the designs, backing colours and values were the discretion of the state involved. Here the Irish have gone for their typical dark colours and recess printing, but as the 60s unwound, colours and designs become lighter. By 1970 there were 30 members, Malta joined in 1971.

In 1974 the generic designs stopped (Except in 1984 when the 1969 design was rehashed in an anniversary issue) and themes were begun, such as art in 1974, landscapes in 1977, Old people in 1982 and so on. Each country issued examples of their own country's response to that theme and a competition of best issue began. The last theme in 2013 was Postal delivery vehicles.

The members remained around 32 - 35 until 1991, when newly free Eastern Bloc countries and ex Soviet republics joined. Rules were loosened so semi west Asian countries like Israel and Azerbaijan have Europa issues. Now there are some 48 nations on the programme. There also seems to be a linkage between these states stamps and the annual Eurovision song contest, which thanks to Johnny Logan, and a few others Ireland has won a few times.

This Irish pair was a fair if some what non descript debut into the Europa stage, surprisingly both values have low issuing numbers and the 1/3 is very scarce mint or used, with values approaching the 1953 issues for An Tostal and Emmett.
