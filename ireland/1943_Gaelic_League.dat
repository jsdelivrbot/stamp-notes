Dr. Douglas Hyde founded the Gaelic League in 1893, an association for the propagation and revival of Irish Gaelic language and culture. He was also the first President of Ireland. The Irish language was nearly extinct by 1890 and the efforts of the league, meant that it would survive and after Independence in 1922, the Irish language was heavily promoted to the stage its the second language of Ireland now and spoken mostly in the West of the Country. English of course is widely spoken too and pretty much the main language.

This issue was the first in nearly 2 years and bought in a series of low value commemoratives, all of which are easy to find, In this case the higher value is more common than the lower one.

The war was raging, Ireland was neutral, but generally on the allied side, still Ireland suffered shortages and overseas mail would have been affected by Nazi uboats, hence the need only for local rate stamps.
