Designer (1867 Fenians in America), and in house crew at Stamping Branch, Photogravure.

The Fenians are also known as the Irish Republican Brotherhood wanted independence by the more violent means of explosions designed to strike fear into British hearts. Unlike earlier groups, they had a large American wing which could supply arms and men to achieve their aims. 

It was not all one way street though, the 1850s and 1860s were notorious for the anti Irish (Irish as slack jawed simians stereotypes) and snobby attitude by British towards the so called Potato Paddy, Paddy Beerbarrels and Bridget McBasher stereotypes. The word "Paddywagon" dates from this time when Police in the UK and America often rounded up groups of unruly drunken Irish men in the large wagons (First coaches and then by 1920 motorvans).

The 1867 bombing campaign which included blowing up a prison and other targets did very little to allay these stereotypes, unfortunately this trigger happy behaviour was the only way to get your point across at the time (I mean watch gangs of New York, thats how people lived in those days unless you were rich and refined of course).

This campaign got nowhere, it did more damage for the cause, now all it did with the pie eyed press of the time was convince the British more that the Irish were a group of violent thugs, and the fact many of the bombs missed their mark and did not work, was more proof that these so called rebels were not very bright. But still you had to admire their aims and the person who designed the stamps, at least had a steady hand, meaning there were brains behind the bombs.

This did not stop them as the 1880s saw a revival of bombing campaigns by Irish men. (1981 O'Donovan Rossa - Parnell (I will mention it more)).
