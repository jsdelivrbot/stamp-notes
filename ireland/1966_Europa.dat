Issue 54 : 26 Sept 1966 - Europa - Boat

7d - Orange and Green - Stylised Boat made out of the CEPT logo, symbolising progress of the Europa community. 2.25 million
1/5 As above but in super catchy grey colour. - 2.5million

Designers - Gregor and Josef Bender from Germany, adapted by Raymond Kyne for this Irish issue- Photogravure, Stamping Brancha nd like all stamps of the period E watermark.

After the excitement of the Easter Uprising and Roger Casement's extra mural activities, this is fluff and one of the least satisfying of the Europa designs, the use of a drab grey colour does not really help it either. Again the high value had more printed and the value of the low value has dropped back 1 penny to 7d. Progress maybe, but no progress in producing a truly eye catching design, however the 1967 issue would change that.
