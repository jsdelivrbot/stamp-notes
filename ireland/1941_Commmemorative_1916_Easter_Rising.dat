In 1941 on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Uprising, the Irish postal authorities issued three stamps, two definitive stamps overprinted and a 2 1/2d commemorative stamp ususally referred to as the "Volunteer" issue.\footnote{1957 40.pdf} 

Within a few weeks of the outbreak of World War in 1914, some of the officials of the irish Republican Brotherhood were makingplans for an insurrection. The Irish Volunteers had been formed in 1913 under the leadership of Eoin MacNeil, professor of Irish History at the University College in Dublin and Vice President of the Gaelic League. The treasurer of the Volunteers was Sir Roger Casement. The Volunteers had been formed as a defensive force to protect the Irish people against agression. Since neither Eoin MaNeil nor Sir Roger Casement was a member of the Brotherhood they knew nothing of this plan.

\section{Uprising Planned for Easter}

Finally, in January of 1916, the I.R.B. set Easte Sunday, April 23rd as the date of the Uprising. Sir Roger was sent to Germany, to make arrangements to land 20,000 rifles in Trales Bay to be used to arm the Volunteers. Casement's instructions were that the  insurrection was scheduled for Easter Sunday and that the arms and ammunition from germany must arrive in Trales Bay not later than the dawn of Holy Saturday.

Casement was succesful in making arrangements for the rifles and a German trawler sailed on April 9th with the weapons. The Captain was instructed not to arrive earlier than April 20th and not later than the dawn of April 22nd. Unfortunately the German vessel carried no wireless.

In the meantime after the sailing of the German vessel, the Military Council of the I.R.B. made a slight change in the date. It was decided thatEaster Monday would be a better day as the British Officers would be away from Dublin, attending the races. A message was sent to Casement that the arrival of the German ship at Trales must not be made prior to the evning of Easter Sunday. This message was received in germany but it was impossible to communicate with the ship at sea.

The 1916 Uprising was self explanatory, it was not so much the deeds of the Patriots involved but how heavy handed the British reaction was, over 1000 arrested and 13 executions, yet most of the damage was caused by the British.

It was a seminal moment in the struggle for Irish Home rule. After it, nearly everyone was behind Ireland's liberation.

\section{German Code Broken}

Unknown to the I.R.B., Great britain had broken teh German code and knew about the shipment of rifles. casement was deeply disturbed by the message and his inability to contact the vessel. he was cnvinced that he should return to Ireland and counsel a postponement of teh rising. To accomplish this, he induced German naval authorities to land him by submarine in Ireland before the arrival of the German trawler.

The I.R.B. continued with their military plans. the German rifles on arrival were to be distributed to Cork, Tipperary, Limerick and the West of Ireland and were to be used to arm the Volnteers there to prevent the British troops from converging on Dublin when the four battalions of the Dublin Brigade of teh Volunteers seized control of the city. 

\section{1941 (Oct. 27th) 27th Anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising}

\ph[40%]{../ireland/1941-easter-uprising.jpg}{Ireland 1941 Easter Rising definitive stamp SG 128 mint \pound2.10}

2.5d - Volunteer Fighter holding gun in front of the Dublin GPO, words in Irish are the opening words of the 1916 Proclaimation. In black. 32,394,840 issued

Designer Victor Brown, Typographed, Watermarked. 

Just one stamp, simple but effective, probably issued as it was decided the overprints did not do this anniversary justice. The rate was the new local letter rate and thus another reason why this stamp was needed. It is relatively common used and only a few dollars mint, whereas the 3d of the earlier issue catalogues at 25 Pounds mint.


With this issue, ends the first period. We pick up in 1943 next with the arrival of slightly more colourful and regular issues.
