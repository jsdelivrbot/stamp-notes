This was an unusual set promoting a Irish Cultural festival that also appealed to foreign visitors, by the 1950s, the threat of war had subsided and air travel was increasing, people had more money and Ireland was beginning to promote Tourism along with culture. Many of the tourists they wanted were descendants of Irish immigrants to other places, particularly the USA, Australia, New Zealand, UK and Canada. This stamp came out in February 2 months ahead of the festival and the high value was solely for overseas rates. 
It promoted Irish cultural life and has run ever since, the Tidy Town project is just one part of it.

An Tóstal (Irish pronunciation: [ən̪ˠ ˈt̪ˠoːst̪ˠal̪ˠ], meaning "The Pageant") was the name for a series of festivals held in Ireland in the 20th Century. Inaugurated in 1953 as a celebration of Irish life, it continued on until 1958 when it died out in most centres except Drumshanbo.

The original purpose of the festival was a celebration of Irish culture, with an emphasis upon drawing tourists into the country during the Easter off-season. It was marked by a series of regional parades, arts and sporting events. Many towns began a clean-up plan, thus starting off the National Tidy Town Awards, which is running still in Ireland. In 1953, a set of commemorative stamps designed by Limerick artist Fergus O'Ryan, were issued by the Irish Post Office.
Chess Competitions were held as part of An Tóstal by the Irish Chess Union from 1954 to 1957.[1]
Drumshanbo in County Leitrim have the distinction of being the only place that An Tóstal has continued to run every year since 1953.
At the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College (Indiana), the festival dubbed "Antostal" celebrates the last full week of classes of the academic year. The events often include competitions, sporting events, concerts and other various performances.


Thirty thousand of the An Tostal commemorative stamps were purchased by Mr. J.A. Nugent, Chairman of An Bord failte (Irish Tourist Development Board), when they were issued at midnight  on Sunday, February 8th. The stamps were brought to An Tostal Headquarters where university students worked into the early hours affixing them to Tostal postcards from people in Ireland to relatives and friends abroad.

It was estimated that 40\% of the postcards were mailed to USA, 30\% to Britain and the other 30\% to other countries. \footnote{1953-14.pdf}

This issue is also famous in the sense the 1/4 value is very scarce mint or used, with values of one mint running close to 30 pounds. On the other hand the low value is very common being worth 1/100th of the high value. Part of the reason was the increase in standard postage to 3d, not long after this stamp was released, meaning a large number no doubt were unsold and left on the market.
