John O'Donovan was a topographer who managed to locate and restore some 63,000 traditional place names in the mid 19th century. He was another Polymath of the Irish people, also being an academic scholar and was a later editor of the annals of the four masters (Refer Michael O'Clerigh and Luke Wadding). He was also descended from Irish nobility - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Donovan_(scholar)

Eugene O'Curry was also a close friend of O'Donovans and was more interested in the archaeology and heritage of the Irish people. He was an antiquarian and professor who gave public lectures on Irish history and the families were related. Both of these patriots were important in engendering Irish culture and pride. Incredibly he had humble beginnings as a pedlar and a poet. Both were also closely linked to Catholic Emancipation and knew Cardinal Newman and Daniel O'Connell very well making them important Irish heroes.

Both died close to each other (December 1861/July 1862) and its fitting that they both appear on this stamp issue. Only 10 million of the 3d were printed, which is low, but probably because the local rate increased to 4d in October 1962, it had been at 3d since 1953. The 1/3 is surprisingly cheap at 1.25 pounds and its a good buy as the number issued was quite low.
