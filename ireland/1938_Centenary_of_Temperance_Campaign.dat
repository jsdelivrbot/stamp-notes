\section{1938 (July 1st) Centenary of Temperance Crusade}
Theobald Mathew was born on the 19th of October, 1790 at Thomastown, 
some distance from Waterford, Ireland. He went to school in Kilkenny and 
studied for the priesthood at famous Maynooth College. He then joined the 
Capuchin Friars and was sent to Cork. 

Upon his arrival there, he was approaohed by two prominent citizens, William Martin, a Quaker and a Protestant olergyman, Rev. Nicholas Dunscombe who enlisted his support for a temperanoe crusade in that city.

Designer Sean Keating, Typographed, based on sculpture by John Hogan (1800 -1858), se watermark. Like most early issues printed on flimsy rough paper and hard to find not toned or ruined by heavy postmarks.

Incredibly for such high issue numbers, this set catalogues at a high 2.50 pounds for the 2d mint and 12 pounds for the 3d in the 2012 SG.

Father Theobald Mathew was born in 1790 and died in 1856, he started a pledge campaign where people gave up drinking alcohol and this applied to everyone whether they had a drinking problem or not. It was very successful after it started in 1838, but had some bad effects, people could and did drink diethyl ether (Meths and other yukky stuff and died). 

Some distilleries closed down and he even was a hit in the USA after he toured there in 1849. His mission endured and the modern temperance movement was born out of his efforts. In someway a dubious honour as time has shown temperance and prohibition has caused more problems than it solved in some cases.

Still his statue stands in O'Connell street Dublin. Ironically he died of a stroke, a condition usually attributed to high alcohol consumption amongst other causes.

\section{Variety}

This variety when first discovered was the 2nd stamp of the 2nd row from the top left hand corner of the sheet. the flaw consists of an inverted comma found directly under the figure "1" of the "1938". the variety was constant when the stamps were first issued but when the Post Offices receieved their fresh supplies upon the first stocks running out, the variety no longer existsed.\footnote{William Kane 1960-58.pdf}. At this time it was the general opinion that a new cliche had been inserted in the plate. This is a very difficult variety to find. One great advantage of this flaw is that itis easily discernable without the aid of a magnifying glass.
