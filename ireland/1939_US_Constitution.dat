Issued for the 150th Anniversary of US Constitution, and symbolises solidarity with the Americans who also won their freedom from the British via a war. Also as many Irish emigrated to the USA mostly between 1845 and 1924. The president of Ireland at the time Eamon De Valera (1882 - 1975) was also born in New York city.
