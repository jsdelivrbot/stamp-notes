This was the second issue to feature Wolfe Tone, this time his birth, the 1948 celebrated the uprising, and this time I have included a link to the 1798 Uprising rather than Wolfe Tone himself. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Rebellion_of_1798

There are better ones, but this is a good overview, basically the United Irishmen had been spurred on by the French and American Revolutions and fought a series of pitched battles between themselves and a French force against the British, they won a few, but ultimately lost and the punishments were bloody. Wolfe Tone was executed with several others and the British overreaction was what started really the whole Home Rule movement.

:) Warning it gets a little political here, so avoid if you like :? 
Rather than stifle Irish opposition to British law and rule, this just intensified it, the Act of Union was passed in 1801 and then there was the Emmet rebellion in 1803 and more disputes and rebellions peppered the 19th century, Irish conciousness for independence stretched across the world, even Irish convicts in Australia rebelled. The Potato famine (1845 - 49) of course intensified things and then the Fenians in the 1860s went further even blowing up Clerkenwell Prison in 1867. Let us hope and pary that the Irish never have to fight for their liberty again. It was not a nice time in their history and its good that the modern state chooses to remember the deeds of the freedom fighters.

But to be balanced it was not all a one way street, many British and civilians died too, and some of the IRA and Fenian acts can not be defended blowing up prisons and IRA bombings of late for instance. I am of joint Irish and English ancestry and while I defend their right to independence, I do not condone fighting or war of any type, nobody needed to die in my opinion Now back to the stamps.

Basically this rebellion began the bloody 125 year long struggle for independence. The stamps themselves are quite nice, simply and effectively done and not as cluttered as the 1948 issue. It was the last recess printed issue as Photogravure took over in the 1960s.
