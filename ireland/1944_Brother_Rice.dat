Founder of the Irish Christian Brothers, not long after Official Toleartion of Catholics (1829), they ahd actually started schools and orphanages for the young as far back as 1802. The organisation grew and still occurs today. Unfortunately their wholesome aims of a complete education and Christian upbringing have been marred by the standard Roman Catholic sexual abuse scandals. Still their impact overall has been positive.

Their goal was to increase educational and vocational opportunities for impoversished catholics through the world. It is now a global organisation head quartered in Vatican city.
