Issue 41 : 17 Sep 1962 - Europa 1962 Tree

6d Pink - Tree Design by Lex Weyer (Luxembourg) symbolic with 19 leaves, each representing a member nation in 1962 - 2,024,160
1/3 - Blue green (Spearmint?) - As above - 2,012,160

Printed by Recess printing at De La Rue and Co Dublin. No special changes were added to the design.

Ironically Ireland did not issue a stamp for 1961 Europa, why I do not know (Possibly as it clashed with the 3 stamp St Patrick Issue, and two more higher values for Europa may have been overload in those days :lol: - now it would just all be spat out). Dodgier places like Lundy, Herm and the like issued 1961 stamps, why not Ireland? This design is lighter and more likeable than the 1960 issue, colours are lighter and the whole feels brighter.

For some unknown reason as well, both values are very cheap, with similar numbers and worth a fraction of the 1960 issue. Since Europa had been around since 1956, the CEPT part had only been functioning since 1960 and this issue is referred to as the 3rd Europa one rather than the 7th.

Ireland would release a new Europa pair every year from now on. More can be read about Europa stamps as listed in the 1960 Entry.
