John Redmond (1857 - 1918) was an Irish MP and leader of the Irish Parliamentary party from 1900 to his death, unlike other Patriots he was a moderate and advocated a non violent solution (Thank God, he was dead before the Civil War). He was also not a big fan of the Easter uprising and he was still a bit derided by some elements.

Overall he was big on Home Rule and pretty much was responsible for the Home Rule act of 1914, only World War One intervened. He was a lawyer and pretty much one fo the most important of the early Irish Politicians. He was also a rather fat man at his death.
