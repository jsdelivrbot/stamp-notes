Issue 47 : 14 Sep 1964 - Europa 5th Issue Flower


8d - Brown and bottle green flower showing 22 petals (One for each country, up 3 from 1962) and the Initials CEPT with Gaelic inscription (An Cuigiu Bliain) - The fifth year. 2.5 million
1/5 - As above but tangerine and brown - 2.5 million

Designer - Georges Betemp of France, Photogravure by Harrison and Sons Ltd., London.

This was another good design and anticipated the flower power revolution early on. Again a pleasing use of colour has been attempted. Despite the similar printing numbers, the higher value is worth more than twice the lower one.
Face values have also gone up along with general rates increase in later 1964.

I should make you all aware, I have less mint copies and more used stamps from now on. About 2/3 mint and a few are used.
