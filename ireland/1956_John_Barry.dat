John Barry 1745 - 1803 was born in Ireland and migrated to the American Colonies, in 1776 he was appointed Commodore in the Continental Navy and served in many skirmishes against the British, a hero in both Ireland and the USA.


The stamps show the statue of him presented by the United States in 1956, it stands in Wexford, again this was a high quality issue.

The style is similar to the 1952 Moore and 1954 Marian year issues and is popular for postmark collectors. Values of the stamps are only moderate, mainly as the 1/3 had the definitive by now and thus its only worth a few pounds.

After this date, we go into 2 years of small sized stamps. Design quality falls slightly, but once we get to 1960 it goes up exponentially.
