1d - Portrait of Mangan, with dates and Inscription, Republic of Ireland in Irish Gaelic and English - 29,992,680 issued

Designer - R.J. King, Typographed

This stamp is often confused with the Republic issue, as it came out only 2 weeks later, but its actually a separate issue. A single 1 penny stamp seems bizarre as this was the printed matter rate. Mangan (1803 - 1849) was another Patriotic Irish poet who wrote prose and poetry mostly celebrating Irish themes. He was also a member of the Young Ireland movement and a scholar. He has been referred to as one of the great Irish poets of all time. Despite the dates, he did not die of the potato famine, but actually from cholera and was also known to imbibe slightly to excess (Never!!!)

Again not the greatest design, but it heralded the new obsession with placing the words "Republic" on new issues for a while. I know my photo is a bit light, but the best software will probably not save the image much. 

This stamp concludes the 1940s and as we move into the 1950s we see the quality improves of stamp designs and printing, but the themes are still heavily patriotic and religious. The 1950s are a period of some of Ireland's most classic designs, some of the high values are pretty scarce as well. To me the 1950s was the peak of Irish commemoratives - so brace yourselves.
