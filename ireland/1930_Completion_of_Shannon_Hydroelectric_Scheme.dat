Now known as Ardnacrusha Power station, the dam was commissioned in 1924 (Having being thought of much earlier before independence). It cost some 5 million punt (1/5 of the state budget then) and was completed on July 22 1929. The part shown on the stamp is the Parteen Weir and the dam was enlarged in 1934 to give a capacity of some 85 MW.

The scheme was a huge success and the dam is still operational today 85 years later. The Shannon is Ireland's largest and most powerful river.
