Design and recess printed by Thomas De La Rue in Dublin

Known as Thomas O'Crohan in English, he lived actually from 1856 (Not 57 as the stamps suggest) to 1937 on Great Blasket Island and he spoke pure Gaelic as the residents did, he wrote some interesting and humourous books there which won International prizes, he was known also as a great wit.


These stamps are quite a plain design, but do their job well enough, surprisingly the 5d is quite scarce and catalogued at 15 pounds mint, mainly as there were many less printed and the set came out only a few weeks after the Redmond one.

1957 would turn out to be the first year with more than 2 sets of commemoratives issued. However production is not really stepped up much until the mid 60s.

As this is the 29th set in 28 years, thats still only an average of one set a year, if countries today could maintain such conservative issuing policies.
