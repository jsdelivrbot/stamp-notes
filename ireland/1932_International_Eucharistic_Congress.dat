\index{1932!Eucharist Congress}
A rather flat looking and plain issue, it celebrated the 31st International Eucharistic Conference in Dublin which took place from 22 - 26 June 1932. It was a huge success with one quarter of the Irish population attending Public Masses and events (Similar to world youth day?). The theme was Irish Missionaries spreading the Eucharist and the 1500th anniversary of St Patrick arriving in Ireland. Many Catholics attended from over the world including a large contingent of Irish Americans.

Catholicism remains popular in Ireland, although church attendance numbers have fallen off. In 1932 Ireland was nearly 95% Catholic and the church was heavily involved with the state. Attending mass was almost compulsory and the church limited many social entertainments at the time.
