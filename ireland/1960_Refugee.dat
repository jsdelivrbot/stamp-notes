1959/60 was a time that Protestant and Catholic churches saw was to end Refugee camps of displaced peoples in Europe, it was successful and apparently by the end of 1960 theyw ere closed. Needless to say it was a pyrrhic victory as the 1960s saw the independence of many third world nations and Middle Eastern conflicts escalate, so as the 1960s wore on, civil wars began and the refugee problem got out of hand again.

This was an inauspicious looking start to the 1960s a decade where themes moved away from the Catholic Church, Patriots and Poets, this was a global celebration and starting with last years Guinness issue, stamps became more likely to be issued for less important occasions.

This design is pretty lightweight and considering it came out in June 1960, when the Year was nearly over, seems a late response to it. Unlike most 1/3, this one is most worthless higher value of all being worth a bare 60p in mint condition, as the 1960s wore on many higher values would also be worth next to nothing.

Needless to say they are easily collected by this time, the postal administration was starting to wake up to the potential of issuing stamps for nearly any occasion. So expect a few less verbose descriptions and links to other material from now on. Its still only 2 or 3 issues a year until 1965, then the issuing button is starting to be pushed harder as you can see.

Rather than being a landmark issue, this was fluff. It may be a global topic, but unless the Catholic church had got behind the interfaith response to this problem (Christians and Jews got involved) there would have not been these stamps issued.
