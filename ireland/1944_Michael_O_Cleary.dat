\ph[60%]{../ireland/1944-Michael-O-Clearly.jpg}{RELAND SG133/4w 1944 MICHAEL O'CLEARY WMK INVERTED MTD MINT \pound2.0.}
0.5d Michael O'Cleary cleary writing at board - Brown about 200 million issued

1/- As above but green - About 50 million issued  
Designer RJ King, Typographed. 

Known as one of the four historians who compiled a book known as the four masters. This was a chronicle of medieval Irish History, ot that much is known about him, except his Gaelic name is O'Cleirigh and he lived between 1590 and 1643/44.

These stamps were originally issued as commemoratives, but within weeks they became definitives, making the 0.5d and 1/- Sword definitives obselete. They were used in this capacity until 1969 and I make an educated guess over numbers issued. As a result these stamps are EXTREMELY common, particularly the 0.5d, whereas the sword versions with the e watermark are fairly scarce, the 1/- being worth some 70 pounds, where the 1/- of this set is 20p mint.
I have included them as they were meant to be commemoratives, but the designs must have attracted the powers that be in the Irish post office to make them something more.
