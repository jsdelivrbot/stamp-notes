Aer Lingus started in 1936 and has had international services ever since, one of the worlds better airlines, they should not be confused with the inferior and much maligned Ryanair. Famous for using the latest jets and its trans atlantic services which have kept the connection between Irish emigres and the homeland.

This issue is quite eye catching and the simple design in white stands out in the background well. The airline would also be the subject of issues for its 50th (1986) and 75th (2011) anniversaries and was even part of a booklet in 1996 (60th anniversary) on Irish aircraft. Both values are higher rates and have a fairly low printing number, its fairly cheap at a couple of pounds each mint.
