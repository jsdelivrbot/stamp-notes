Declared by the Pope, 1933 was made a Holy year, mostly in commemoration of the Crucifixion of Christ. This was a Holy Jubilee year, when important Christian anniversaries were declared. As the exact date of the crucifixion was unknown, this makes an educated guess. Not too many other countries did this issue, but this is a simple but effective design. Incredibly the 3d is only worth marginally more than the 2d and is the harder to find of earlier commemorative sets.
