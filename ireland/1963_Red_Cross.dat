Issue 44 - 2 Dec 1963 - Centenary of International Red Cross


4d - Grey and Red, a design of a cricle with red cross and flame from symbolic lamp, the emblem for the organisations centenary year, with "International Red Cross" in Gaelic. - 25 million
1/3 - Grey, Green background and Red as above 1.75 million

Designer - Peter Wildbur (First of many for him), Photogravure printed (1st ever for an Irish commemorative stamp issue) by Harrison and Sons Ltd. London

This design was innovative in many ways, it was the first photgravure stamp ever issued and it was a first attempt at true graphic art. However the background colours are a bit dull and pale and the fact its in Irish rather than English, still means we are at a traditional juncture with Irish stamps, but things were changing. 

Designs now were much less cluttered and as in England with David Gentlemans graphic art designs, the Irish were becoming more inventive now. The next few issues will show a transition from the home printed blocky stamps of the 30s and 40s through the conservative and ornate issues of the 50s, into this transitional 60s phase and then the movement into the innovative, breezy and fully modern issues of the 70s.

The Red Cross started by Henri Dunant in Switzerland has become a truly international Medical organisation, nearly every country in the world issued stamps in 1963 celebrating its centenary, and again in 1988 for the 120th anniversary and 150th in 2013. Some like New Zealand issued theirs in 1959 claiming that was the anniversary year. It seems that Henri Dunant thought of it in 1859, but 1863 was the formation of the International Committee
