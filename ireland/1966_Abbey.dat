This issue is not too bad, a bit dark and dull, they could have really used a more modern image and had it been 10 years later, a photograph. Still it proved 1966's stamp program began with a bang and ended with a whimper, although this is better than the mediocre Europa issue.

The sets become cheaper now too, with most of the higher values costing only 20 or 30p. By this stage the sets were being actively promoted and being bought up by collectors on standing orders and used examples were ending up in packets. Its not until the 80s when inflation pushed up face value, stamps begin to cost more again. Issue numbers have crept up to 4 or 5 a year away from from the 1 or 2 a decade or two earlier.

The later 60s and 70s are easily the cheapest period to start a collection of Irish stamps, they are generally plentiful and cheap, even if many would have nasty heavy or machine cancels and toning is a true problem on the acid bath paper used into the late 80s. Still good quality examples exist and can be kept with proper albums and storage.
