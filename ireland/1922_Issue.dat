\chapter{1922 Provisional Government of Ireland} 

To produce the  first official stamps of the newly formed State, the Provisional Government authorized the overprinting of the then current stamps of Great Britain, with the words \textsc{Provisional Government of Ireland 1922}. The overprinting was carried out by the Dollard Printing House, Dublin Ltd, who on February 2, 1922 submitted proofs to the postal authorities who subsequently accepted them. 

The stamps were placed on sale on the 17th February 1922 replacing the current stocks.

The distinguishing mark of this issue is the long tail of the "9" of "1922" and that there is no fullstop.
