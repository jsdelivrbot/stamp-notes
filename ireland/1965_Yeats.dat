William Butler Yeats is one of Ireland's most famous literary sons, incredibly we had to wait until 1965 to get an issue of him. He wrote poetry and plays and even won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1923. He was also a protestant anglo Irish man and probably the first author celebrated who was actively mostly in the 20th rather than the 19th century.

This stamp issue was the first in a while not to be printed by a private firm, but done in house at the Stamping Branch of the Irish Post Office Department (An Post was years off). By now they had a Advisory committee and a marketing branch and had state of the art machines for production. I will refer to these issues as Irish Post Office printed from now. The designs are fairly innovative, a bit dull by todays or even the mid 70s standards but streets ahead of what was being produced even 2 or 3 years earlier. Like most high values, the top value is worth between 2 and 3 pounds.
