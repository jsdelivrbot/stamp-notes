The 1964/65 World fair was in New York - USA. It was fitting the Irish had a large pavilion there as New York like most of the Eastern USA has a large Irish immigrant population. The fair was in the same location as the 1939 and a huge success. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_Y ... d%27s_Fair

More importantly, this stamp issue was a huge step forward, it had true multicolour design, perspective art and the inscription was in English. It was also designed by a professional firm for the first time and looked it, when it came out in 1964, it would have stood out from all the earlier stamps as it was brighter and more modern looking. Yet from this point on, nearly all issues would look this bright and colourful. 

The mid 60s was time that Ireland began to modernise, the shackles of the church were loosening and the government and society were starting to become slightly less repressive and conservative. Not quite Graham Norton levels yet, but not stuck in the days of Angela's ashes either.

The eagle eyed amongst you, may have also noticed the price increase, the local rate has climbed to 5d (Only 18 months after it went to 4d) and the 1/3 rate is now 1/5.
