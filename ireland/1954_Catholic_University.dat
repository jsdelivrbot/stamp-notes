Cardinal John Henry Newman (1801 - 1890) is very interesting, entirely British he was actually first a Anglican priest, and travelled widely, he was part of the High church movement but over time became disenchanted with Anglicanism and started sympathising and supporting Roman Catholics, by the time he was middle aged, he made the leap and converted to Catholicism becoming a priest in 1849.

Always interested in education and the role of the church in education (He no doubt had heard of De La Salle) he established the Catholic University of Dublin in 1854, what the stamps commemorate and this was an opposition to the Anglican led Trinity College (Things have eased a bit since then). It became University College Dublin.

He never took his commitments to Catholicism lightly and died in 1890, he was beatified in 2010 by Pope Benedict XVI, he was also responsible for a lot of new dogma in the church.

As great as the man was, the stamp issue is another matter entirely, its small and blocky looking, even a few wave lines disfigures it and its easy to see the difference in quality of these typographed local issues versus some of the higher quality stamps of the De La Rue and later Harrison and sons that were issued. The 1/3 is worth 17 pounds mint and 6 used, a lot less than Emmet as the stamps came out a few months before the new airmail one at 1/3.

The 2d had a record 71 million issued, this must have been for an unsealed or post card rate, as this is the highest so far for any commemorative stamp.

1955 would be the last year ever without a new commemorative issue, but 1957 and 1958 would see a couple more typographed issues
