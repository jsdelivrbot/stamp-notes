\chapter{1945 (Sept. 15th) Centenary of Death of Thomas Davis}    

Two values, a 2 1/2 blue and a 6d purple, were
emitted by the Dept. of Posts on Sept.15, 1945
They were issued to commemorate the centenary 
of the Young Ireland Party and were released 
on the eve of the l00th anniversary 
of Thomas Davis'  death. 

The Young Ireland Party began in 1842 when as a result of persecution, many of the leaders of the movement were forced to leave Irish soil and seek homes in foreign shores.

Thomas Davis was a poet and founder of the young Ireland movement, he was one of the many patriots upset with the 1801 act of Union and thus wrote poetry which expressed self determination amongst the Irish poor and dispossessed. Needless to say he was not that popular with the English.

This issue is a return to the standard rate/higher rate issues and the printing of the lower value was the largest for a commemorative stamp so far. Despite the fact the printage for the 6d stamp was also high, it is still fairly scarce at 8 pounds for a mint copy.
