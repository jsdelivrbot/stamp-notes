Theobald Wolfe Tone (1763 -1798) one of the leaders of the Failed 1798 insurrection against Britain. He led the Young Irishmen, one of the first Home Rule and Irish Patriot movements (Before the Fenian Brotherhood and IRA). The French Napoleonic troops were supposed to help but got storm tosssed and the rebellion ended badly with many of the leaders imprisoned. Tone was to be executed but was found dead in his cell from a neck wound, it was believed he had taken his own life. The actions of this rebellion were partly responsible for the urgency to get the Act of Union underway.


A better than average early issue here and a good topic, it was revisited in 1998 for the 200th anniversary
