One of the true Irish Patriots, Thomas Clarke (1857 -1916) was one of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rebellion, and he paid the ultimate price for being a part of it, execution by the British. He was also the first to sign the Proclaimation of Irish independence. He was actually born in the UK to Irish parents and his father was in the British army, he joined the Fenians young and was an Acoloyte of Jeremiah Donovan O'Rossa. Again we have debates over his year of birth.
His death was at the notorious Kilmainham jail in Dublin came just 3 weeks after the rebellion.
