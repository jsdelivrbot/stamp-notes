\chapter{Forerunners}


In stamp collecting circles, the word forerunner usually describes a postage stamp used during the time period before a region or territory issues stamps of its own. However, in Irish reference books, such as Handbook of Irish Philately, the term forerunners usually refers to political and propaganda labels. These often resemble stamps, but few of them were used on Irish mail and they had no legal standing for mail in Ireland.

A more general way of categorizing the Irish political labels is to lump them with what philatelists call cinderellas. This term - coined by the Cinderella Stamp Society, founded in London in 1959 - refers to the so-called stepchildren of philately: an often bewildering variety of items formatted like postage stamps but not primarily definable as such. Cinderellas are frequently described as material not included in general (as opposed to specialized) postage stamp catalogs, though this scarcely provides a consensus definition. The Cinderella Society itself specifies 'local stamps, telegraph stamps, fiscals [revenue and tax stamps], bogus and phantom issues, Christmas seals, registration labels, advertisement and exhibition labels' - though this list could be expanded (or abbreviated) almost at will, depending on one's particular perspective. In any case, all the Irish political labels discussed herein can safely be called cinderellas. 

Most can be readily identified with one or another political faction or organization - Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionists, the IRA - though the particulars of that group's involvement with the printing of a label may be unknown. A nearly universal purpose of the forerunners was the dissemination of propaganda. Another, recurring purpose was the raising of funds for the cause espoused by the label (some include values as part of the design; others do not). 

But the ways in which the labels were meant to be used varied considerably. The Sinn Féin propaganda labels of 1908-16 (set 4L) were specifically intended for use on correspondence - not to pay the postal fee, but to set an 'Irish stamp' alongside the British one as a political gesture. Others of the forerunners had no intended postal association: the Manchester Martyrs label of 1916 (8L) was to be folded around a pin to form a small paper flag - though examples on cover are known. The closest thing to legitimate postage stamps among the labels shown here is the IRA issue of 1922 (11L), printed to prepay postage in the Republican dominated south of Ireland during the Civil War (these stamps were prepared, but never issued).

The collection and study of Irish political labels received its greatest impetus, perhaps, from the inclusion of a section on forerunners in David Feldman's 1968 Handbook. Feldman included thirty-one major varieties, loosely arranged into five sets. The MacDonnell Whyte handbooks built upon this somewhat, ultimately including forty-five major varieties grouped into eleven sets. These range from the Fenian issue of 1865-67 to the White Cross labels of 1922. Inclusion in Feldman and MacDonnell Whyte served to canonize these labels as mainstream collectibles within the broader area of Irish philately.

Four values, 1c, 3c, 24c (deep-green), and 24c (mauve-purple) were produced in New York by the Irish veterans of the US Civil War and are known as the 1865–67 Fenian issue. The 1893 colonial design are unofficial essays and are classed as bogus.[6]

Between 1907 and 1916, Sinn Féin, one of the nationalist organisations of the time, issued propaganda labels symbolising Irish nationhood. Their use as stamps was forbidden by Post Office regulations.[6] The first design was a Celtic Cross, similar to one later adopted for two definitive stamps of 1923, and the second depicts a female figure and harp in an oval frame. In 1912, labels inscribed "Imperial Union" appeared, with a design of a larger harp and female figure. These labels, expressing unionist sentiments, are believed to have been printed in Manchester as a counter to the Sinn Féin labels. After the Home Rule Bill for Ireland was passed in parliament, an Irish Republican body issued labels in 1916 with the portraits of three nationalist heroes known as The Manchester Martyrs against an Irish tricolour background. Forgeries of these labels are common.[6] Following the Easter Rising of 1916, American sympathisers printed eight ERIE PUIST labels showing portraits of seven prominent leaders and a harp and shamrock label. The misspelling ERIE for ÉIRE could have been because of hasty preparation.[6]

The Irish Republican Army, that controlled much of the southern part of the country during the Irish civil war, issued a 1d, 2d and 6d label, mainly because of a stamp shortage. These were printed in Cork and were to be put on sale in August 1922, but in the meantime the Irish Free State army landed near Cork and the IRA set fire to their own barracks before they retreated from Cork, destroying most of the labels.[6]
