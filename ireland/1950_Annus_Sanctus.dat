This set was the second issued for a Holy Year (The first was 1933 - 34). It was also the first to not be typographed and not to be printed by the Irish Government. This was a thoroughly modern issue (Even if it was cod Medieval/Victorian in design) and was well received. Printing numbers are relatively low for such an issue. The 3d is actually worth the same as the 9d, mainly due to its low printage numbers. The set is fairly scarce at the two high values worth close to 10 quid each.

Holy Year was declared by the Pope in 1949 and part of it was to gain a new anthem for the Vatican city, also it had to do with St Peter preaching and the Irish also celebrated it.

In honour a concrete cross was raised at Bray - County Wicklow http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray_Head
