William Brown was born in 1777 in County Mayo, but in 1786 his family moved to Philadelphia in the newly minted USA. He became a ships boy not much later and spent his life at sea, by 1810 he had started supporting the Argentinians against the Spanish and was in charge of setting up the Argentine navy after independence, he must have done a good job as when he died in 1857, he was still admiral, and has changed his name to Guillermo Brown and spoke pure Spanish - ci ci senor. Now in Argentina his name is on 1200 streets and dozens of ships are called Almirante Brown (Admiral Brown).

The issue itself is very plain and a real step back from the better ones of late, still blocky printing and too bold colours, render it ugly mint or used. Its probably why the 1/3 is scarce mint or used, with prices edging 20 pounds. The 3d on the other hand is mega common at 15p.
