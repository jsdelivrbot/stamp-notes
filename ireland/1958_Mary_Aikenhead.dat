Mary Aikenhead (1787 - 1858) was actually born into an Anglican family (Her mother was Catholic) when she was 15 she was secretly baptised a Catholic and being a sickly girl gave her life to serving the sick and poor and taking nun's orders. 
She started the Irish sisters of charity which ran benevolent institutions for the poor and downtrodden. More here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Aikenhead

This set was actually the second printed by Waterlow, the 1st was the 1950 Holy Year set, for such a small stamp, the quality is well and the image emits a bit of warmth. The 3d is very common at 10p mint or used, but the 1/3 is a more elusive stamp again around the 10 pound mark. This was the last of the bantam sized issues.
