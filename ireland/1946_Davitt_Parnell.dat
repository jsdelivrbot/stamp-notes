Both names mentioned were famous Irish members in the British Parliament who were propagating and suggesting Home rule for the Irish, the theme here is the Irish lifestyle of faith and farming.

Sorry to say, but this is one of my least favourite sets, the designs are blocky looking and rather coarse, but the message is directed well. Its typical of this pre 1960 material which really hammered home the message of Irish pride, Gaelic culture and stamps that simply but effectively conveyed that message. It was also the beginning of the higher value being 3d, which was only a half penny more and it was I think a postage rate to Ulster and the UK.
