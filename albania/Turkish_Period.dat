\chapter{The Turkish Post 1849-1912}

As part of Turkey the Albanian district received its first Turkish postage stamps in 1863; before that the issues from Albanian post-offices could only be identified by the postmarks. The earliest cover noted is dated 1857, but is believed that the first Turkish post-office in Albania was opened in Scutari as early as 1849. My collection contains two registered letters sent from {{wi:Ischkodra}}, the Turkish name for {{wi:Scutari}}, to Bitoglia in Serbia in 1861 and 1862 (fig. 1); they show the Turkish postmark Ischkodra, with a smaller handstamp 'Taautli - Registered'. When the definitive Turkish stamps came in use they were cancelled by postmarks showing in a double circle the name of the town in Turkish letters (fig. 2).

Later on Turkish postmarks were used which showed the name of the town in Egyptian characters. These also bore either the title Toste Imperiale Ottomane d'Albanie' in Grotesque capitals, or such a title as 'Scutari d'Albanie' in Grotesque capitals only with a date indication. Later on the Turkish postmarks showed the date and year, and also indicated the town or village name in two different types: normal Turkish and Egyptian in Grotesque type (fig. 3). After 28th November, 1912, Turkish stamps remained in use until Albania issued her own stamps, but the postmarks were changed; the postmark now showed only the Grotesque lettering. The mixture of Turkish and Eygptian type existed no longer.
