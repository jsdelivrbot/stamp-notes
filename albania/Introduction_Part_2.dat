\section{THE GREEK POST (second part) (1914-16)}

The Greeks returned to the Korytsa district and in September 1914 a set of fifteen attractive
stamps from 1 lepton to 25 drachmai was issued in Moschopolis, situated north west of
Korytsa. My collection contains a registered cover (fig. 16) with the values 5, (2 x.) 10 and
30 lepta, sent by P. Gyparos, Commander of Moschopolis, on 28th October, 1914, from
Moschopolis to London, where it arrived on 25th November, 1914. The 5 and 10 lepta have
the normal postmark 'Moschopolis'. The 30 lepta is obliterated with the handstamp
'Autonomous Epirus 24-6-14 occupation of Moschopolis'. The second 5 lepta is obliterated
with the handstamp 'Field-postoffice Epirus'.

Another set was issued in October 1914 in Chimarra. This time it was well printed and
showed the portrait of the Greek King Constantine (fig. 17). The set contains eleven values of fifty stamps. The two 5 and 10 lepta were printed in the combination of one vertical row
of five stamps of 5 lepta; six vertical rows of five stamps of the 10 lepta; and three vertical
rows of five stamps of 2 lepta. The 20 lepta and 1 drachma were also printed in this manner.
The sheet of fifty stamps is constituted as follows: six vertical rows of five stamps of
20 lepta; 4 vertical rows of five stamps of 1 drachma.

I have seen cancellations of Chimarra dated 15th October, 8th and 23rd November, 1914.
Delvino, Argyrocastro, Korytsa and some other towns used during 1915 and 1916 the
Greek stamps issued in 1911 and 1913, with a vertical or horizontal overprint 'N. Epirus'.
I also have a cover (fig. 18) sent in May 1915 from Delvina via Santi Quaranta to the isle of
Korfu. Such real covers are scarce.

Furthermore a second definitive issue, showing a double eagle, was in use. This set
contained eight values and two more stamps of the same type, but with the supplementary
indication 'Korytsa'. These issues remained in use from 1914 until the end of the Greek
occupation in 1916.

As the state of Epirus has never been recognised by the other nations we have to consider
all these stamps as belonging to Albania.

\section{THE FRENCH POST (1916-18)}

Towards the end of 1916 the French and Italian troops forced the Greeks to leave South
Albania and give up the Republic of Epirus. The Italians occupied Valona and Argyrocastro;
the French kept the eastern part of South Albania and created the Republic of
Korytsa.

At first some remainders of Greek stamps with overprint N. Epirus were overprinted
again; this time with a small primitive double eagle in two types and the new value in
centimes (fig. 19). There were now two different stamps of lOc. and three different stamps
of 25c. One of the 25c. overprints became the rarest stamp of Albania, with a quotation of
2,750 francs Yvert for mint and 2,000 francs used. My copies are cancelled: December
1916 and January 1917.

Next a set of eight stamps was issued. The sheets of twelve stamps contained twelve
different types. The 5c. of the first print showed on the third stamp of the first row the error
'inverted V in the word 'Vetqeveritare', (fig. 20), which error does not exist in later prints
of this issue. The inscription was 'Shqiperie Vetqeveritare' and means 'Independent Albania'.

The second set with the more logical inscription 'Republika Shqipetare' (fig. 21) was also
printed in sheets of twelve stamps and contained the same different types of double eagle
and frame as the first set.

Fig. 20 Fig. 21

A 25c. stamp was not included in this set, and was replaced by two supplementary values,
which must be considered as errors. They show 2 and 3 ctm, instead of 2 or Sets.
In 1918 the 5c. of the second issue was overprinted with the missing value 25c. Furthermore
a 25c. was issued with an altered inscription. The new inscription was 'quarku i
korces' and means 'Surroundings of Korytsa'. Both overprints exist in many different types
of the overprint and the twelve different types of the stamp itself. All these stamps had
values in French currency.

At the end of the First World War the Repepublic of Korytsa, created by the French, again
became a part of the Republic of Albania.

As the Albanian troops occupied Tepeleni during May 1914 special stamps ceased to be
issued. Tepeleni is situated south east of Valona, and official handstamp stamps were used,
as had happened in Korytsa. Envelopes also were overprinted with a handstamp of the
Prefecture of Tepeleni. Since the envelopes showed different colours, many shades of paper
are possible. The value 1 Grosch was put on by a separate handstamp. Normally both
handstamps had the same blue colour. I have seen copies with value indication in lilac.
The oldest date known is 30th May, 1914 (Fig. 22).

\section{THE GREEK POST (third part) (1940-41)}

The French expression Thistoire se repete is confirmed in South Albania by events which
happened in the years 1940 and 1941. During the Balkan war of 1912-13, and twice during
1914-15 in the First World War, South Albania was occupied by the Greeks. In October
1940, Greece was attacked by the Italian army operating from South Albania.
For the fourth time in thirty years the Greek army marched north again, after they had
thrown the Italians out of Greece and driven them back into Albania. Greece occupied
South Albania once more.

In addition to many field post-offices in the military postal sectors four civil post-offices
were opened. At the beginning these offices only issued normal Greek stamps, but later
Greek stamps arrived overprinted 'Greek Administration'. My collection contains covers
and cards franked with Greek stamps without and with this overprint. Further covers without
stamps were used during the campaign by Greek officials; also normal military postcards.
In addition to the Greek military cards, Italian military postcards, which were
captured by the Greeks, were also used by the Greek soldiers. All correspondence was
controlled by a Greek censor. Next to Greek handstamps, they used Albanian ones too.
Fig. 23 shows the Albanian postmark Sarande (Aghyi Saranta) on a Greek stamp with
overprint: Greek Administration.


During the campaign the postmark TAX TOMEYE was also used. TT means postal
sector. The indicated number refers to the concerning military postal sector of the Greek
occupation army in south Albania (Fig. 24).

Fig. 24
The Greeks were thrown back again as soon as the Italians got help from the Germans,
so that the Greek occupation only lasted a couple of months. The four Greek civil postoffices
in Aghyi Saranta, Argyrocastro, Delvino, and Korytsa, which were opened in
December 1940, closed again in April 1941 after the retreat of the Greek army.

\section{THE ITALIAN ALBANIAN POST (1939-43)}

This time the Italians stayed in Albania, including the Southern part, until the capitulation
of Italy in 1943.

Philatelic recollections of this period are normally the Italian stamps issued for Albania
with the portrait of the Italian Emperor-King. As a special philatelic souvenir, I also show
covers franked with the Albanian stamps of those days but used in 1941 during the Italian-
Albanian occupation of Prizren, situated in Yugoslavia just opposite the Albanian border.
I also show an Italian military postcard, the same type as the cards, which was captured by
the Greeks. On this occasion the card bore the indication 'Posta Militare Albania', with
the cancellation 'Officio Posta Militare 99'.

After the Italian capitulation, the remaining Italian-Albanian stamps were overprinted in
connection with the new independence.

\section{THE GERMAN POST (1944-45)}

Some time after the Italian capitulation the German army occupied Albania, but I cannot
show you any philatelic reflection of this period as I have not so far found one. The fights
between the Albanian partisans and the German troops lasted until the Germans gave up
and returned from Albania to their Heimat.



from 1 lepton to 5 drachmai, some of which seem to have been printed in combined sheets
