## Postage stamps and postal history of Albania

ALBANIA is a country of over 10,000 square miles, situated on the Adriatic Sea, bounded
on the south by Greece, and on the north and east by Montenegro and Serbia, which were previously  part of
Yugoslavia. Its history dates from the days of the Roman Empire. The town of Dyrrhachium,
the Albanian name for which is Durres, was mentioned as early as 200 B.C. ; it is now known as {{wi:Durazzo}}.

The inhabitants of Albania, led by Ismail Kemal, declared themselves free from Turkey
on 28th November, 1912. This decision was finally accepted by the Conference of London
in July 1913.
The territory of Albania was important for philatelists for many years before that Conference.

The philatelic field is wide and I propose therefore to deal with the Turkish and
foreign post, and the temporary emergency issues, used in Albania from 1849 to 1945.
          
\section{THE TURKISH POST (1849-1912)}

As part of Turkey the Albanian district received its first Turkish postage stamps in 1863;
before that the issues from Albanian post-offices could only be identified by the postmarks.
The earliest cover I have seen is dated 1857, but I believe that the first Turkish post-office
in Albania was opened in Scutari as early as 1849.
My collection contains two registered letters sent from Ischkodra, the Turkish name for
Scutari, to Bitoglia in Serbia in 1861 and 1862 (fig. 1); they show the Turkish postmark
Ischkodra, with a smaller handstamp 'Taautli - Registered'.
When the definitive Turkish stamps came in use they were cancelled by postmarks
showing in a double circle the name of the town in Turkish letters (fig. 2). Later on Turkish
postmarks were used which showed the name of the town in Egyptian characters. These
also bore either the title Toste Imperiale Ottomane d'Albanie' in Grotesque capitals, or
such a title as 'Scutari d'Albanie' in Grotesque capitals only with a date indication. Later
on the Turkish postmarks showed the date and year, and also indicated the town or village
name in two different types: normal Turkish and Egyptian in Grotesque type (fig. 3).
After 28th November, 1912, Turkish stamps remained in use until Albania issued her own
stamps, but the postmarks were changed; the postmark now showed only the Grotesque
lettering. The mixture of Turkish and Eygptian type existed no longer.

\section{THE AUSTRIAN POST (1852-1918)}

Next to the Turkish Post this Austrian Post was active in the harbour towns of Scutari,
Durazzo, Valona and Santi Quaranti; i.e. the Austria-Hungarian Post. Later on an Austrian
post-office was opened also in San Giovanni di Medua, and there existed a sub post-office
in Dulcigno, belonging to San Giovanni di Medua. This sub-office used the combined
postmark Dulcigno/San Giovanni di Medua.

From 1852 onwards we find covers without stamps but showing only an Austrian postmark.
I have a cover used in 1858 with the postmark Valona of 19th December, sent via
Trieste on 25th December to Venice, where it arrived on 26th December. Another cover
was sent in 1864 from Durazzo to Vienna (fig. 4).

From 1864 Austrian Lombardo Venice stamps, and from 1867 Austrian Levant stamps
and postal stationery, were also used, but covers without stamps were still accepted. I can
prove this by two different covers sent in 1869 and 1873 from Durazzo to Curzola.
The blue postmark used in 1869 does not indicate the year, but the greenish 1873 postmark
does indicate the year.

The Austrian Levant stamps remained in use in Albania till 1915 (fig. 5); the latest postmark
I have is one from San Giovanni di Medua dated 28th January, 1915.
In connection with the Great War, which had started in the meantime, we find the Austrian
Fieldpost and the Austrian Etappenpost, for the army only used army postmarks.
The civilians could use K.U.K. fieldpost stamps.

The military intervention of Austria-Hungary had started in 1913, with a view to helping
the Government of Ismail Kemal immediately after the declaration of the independence of
Albania. My collection contains several cards, a cover and some single stamps used by
Austrian-Hungarian soldiers, sent from Scutari, Durazzo and Santi Quaranti (fig. 6) between
30th December, 1913 and 3rd August, 1914. The Austrian Fieldpost in Albania used in
1916 the normal Albanian postal stationery of the Skanderbeg issue.
K.U.K.-fieldpost or Etappen postmarks with town-names or number indications were
used by the Austrian army from 1916 until 1918. Hungarian stamps have also been used
on some of the fieldpost-mail which had to be paid for, and also for the Etappenpost.
208

The Hungarian Fieldpost and Etappenpost used their own postmarks; the K.U.K. fieldpost
stamps were also used from 1917 onwards on private correspondence.
At the end of the first Great War the Austrian-Hungarian army left Albania.

\section{The Italian Post  1903-14 and 1916-22}

The Italian Post had offices in Durazzo, (fig. 7), Valona (fig. 8) and Scutari from 1903
onwards. Italian and Italian Levant Stamps and postal stationery were used.
The stamps with the overprint 'Albania' were used in the three harbour-towns, and from
1909 onwards Italian stamps with overprints Durazzo, Scutari and/or Valona. After the
foundation of the Independent State of Albania in 1912 these Italian issues remained in
use till the end of 1914.

During the war in 1916 Italy joined the Allies; the Italian troops returned to Albania and
landed in southern Albania near Valona. From now on we find obliterations of the Italian
occupation forces on normal Italian stamps, or on a combined franking of normal Italian
stamps with the Italian stamps for Durazzo, Scutari and Valona. Further correspondence -
cards of Italian soldiers - also appeared with postmarks only.

All private letters were censored until the end of the Great War and were sent by the
Posta militare truppe occupazions from 1916 till 1919, and by the Posta militare till 1920.
We find Italian postmarks on Italian stamps on letters from Valona to Vienna dated as late
as December 1921.

\section{THE MONTENEGRO POST (1912-16)}

At the declaration of Independence in November 1912, the north of the country, including,
the towns San Giovanni di Medua (the Albanian name is Shengjin) and Scutari (the Albanian
name is Shkoder) were occupied by the Montenegrins. They remained there until July
1913, and returned after the departure of the Prince von Wied in September 1914 to remain
till 1916. These dates are proved by covers and cards, franked with Montenegro stamps and
obliterated by Montenegro postmarks. The letters and cards were censored from 1915
onwards. There are two types of censormarks; the former reads: 'Controlled by censor',
and the latter: 'Controlled by military censor'.
The earliest and latest circular postmarks differ in as much as the oldest show a bolder
and larger type; later on the letters are smaller. The Montenegro post was also used by
soldiers of the Serbian army, which fled to Corfou via Albania from the summer of 1915
until the spring of 1916. My collection contains a card and a cover franked with Montenegro
stamps and sent, via the International Red Cross in Switzerland, to Bacharest and Nisch.
A postcard from Scutari, addressed to the Serbian consulate in Salonika, shows next to the
normal Montenegrin Scutari postmark with inscription in two languages dated 13th
December, 1915, the Essad-Durazzo postmark dated 27th December, 1915 and the
Italian Durazzo postmark dated 30th December, 1915. In addition it shows the mark:
'Bologna Posta Estera' and the Montenegrin military censor mark.
Italian Levant stamps with Scutari overprint were used in Scutari in January 1916, and
even Serbian Field postcards, all cancelled with the same Montenegrin Scutari postmark.

\section{THE SERBIAN POST (1912-16)}

The retreating Serbian troops stayed in the central part of Albania, including the towns
Tirana and Elbasan, until 1915. They then went further south and left Albania at the
beginning of 1916, on their way to Corfou. These historical facts have also been proved by
Serbian postage stamps obliterated with Elbasan in Grotesque letters (fig. 9) and with Serbian postmarks with the inscription in two languages, with the name Tirana and Elbasan also
in Cyrillic letters (fig. 10). Furthermore my collection contains a letter with an Essad-stamp,
obliterated with the Essad-Durazzo postmark and addressed to Elbasan, where the Serbs
impressed the Serbian censormark and the Elbasan postmark used in these days.

\section{THE GREEK POST (first part) (1912-14)}

The Greeks occupied a former part of Turkey called [Epirus](../northern-epirus) in 1912. On their way further
to the north the Greek army was halted under pressure from Italy and Austria. The frontier
then lay from south of Valona straight onwards to the southern point of Lake Ochrida.
The trouble continued until July 1913 when the Congress of London confirmed the foundation
of the Independent State of Albania. The northern part of Epirus, taken by the
Greeks, became the southern part of the new state Albania. The Italians and Austrians
assisted the Albanian Government, which was formed in Valona and in which both north
and south Albania were represented. In reab'ty Albania is divided into three communities:
the population in the north is Roman Catholic, in the middle it is Mohammedan, and in
the south Greek Orthodox.

During this time Greek stamps (fig. 11) were still used in South Albania. The majority of
the south Albanians did not recognise the Albanian Government and already before the
arrival of the proposed future King of Albania, the Prince von Wied, South Albania was
declared the Independent Republic of Epirus, although in reality it remained under Greek
influence.

The first stamps issued in February 1914 in the southern part of Albania are the skull
and crossbones set, the so called Chimarra-issue. This primitive issue was produced by the
use of three different handstamps. The value 1 lepton was indicated in blue; the values 5
and 25 lepta in red; and the value 10 lepta (fig. 12) in black. The double eagle, skull, bones
and inscription are in black, blue or red.

The control mark, a seal handstamp with the initials of Spiro Spiromilios, the Governor
of Chimarra, is always in blue. The translation of the inscription is 'Greek autonomous
Epirus: Freedom or death: Defend your country'. I have copies used in Chimarra, Delvino
and Aghyi Saranta.

After this temporary issue the definitive stamps, showing an inhabitant in national dress
at a shooting contest, came into use. The values 10 and 25 lepta have the name Epirus; the
other six values indicate Autonomous Epirus.
Former Turkish stamps have the overprint in black or red reading 'Autonomous Epirus',
with the new value in Greek currency (fig. 13). They were used in the town of Argyrocastro
from March 1914; they were also used in Delvino and Aghyi Saranta.
Fig. 12

The Government of the new Republic of Epirus could not last very long and had to
move south by force of circumstance in the spring of 1914. Following a request of the
London Congress of 1913 the Dutch Government appointed twelve Dutch officers to go to
Albania in order to form and instruct the Albanian military police, needed against the
Greeks in the south of Albania and the rebels in the centre and north. The members of the
Dutch mission in Albania were deployed over five districts: Scutari, Durazzo, Elbasan,
Korytsa and Valona including Argyrocastro.

\section{DUTCH MILITARY MISSION ISSUE (1914)}

After the Greeks had left Korytsa and its neighbourhood three members of the Dutch
mission, Snellen van Vollenhoven, Doorman and Mallinckrodt, had to take over the power
and represented the Albanian Government in Korytsa from 18th March, 1914. As stamps
were no longer available in Korytsa it was decided to use existing envelopes and print on
them the handstamp of the 'Commission de controle provisoire Korea'.
The Albanian double eagle is in the central feature of the design. The value was printed
separately. Two values exist: 10 and 25 para. The normal colour of this issue is a violet
shade. They are much more rare in black, and some covers exist with ththe stamp printed in
blue. The value is always printed in red.

The colours of the envelopes were blue, grey, green, white (fig. 14) or beige. It was permitted
to cut the stamps from the envelope and use them as postage-stamps. The Commission
handstamp was later also printed on sheets of white ungummed paper for the production
of 25 para stamps.
The 10 para stamp is rather scarce. The existing frankings are: 20 para = 2 x 10 para;
35 para = 1 x 10 and 1 x 25 para; 50 para = 2 x 25 para or 5 x 10 para. For inland post
I have seen the frankings of 20 and 35 para. 50 para was needed on covers to other countries.
I have this franking on covers to Holland, Greece and Turkey.
The 10 para is mostly printed on cover or on paper cut from an envelope. The 25 para
from the print on sheets is regularly used on envelopes too. I have a cover sent from Korytsa
to Utrecht (fig. 15).
I have never seen cuttings of the 10 para used on cover. Furthermore I believe that copies
of this value do not exist printed on sheets of paper. The 10 para exist with figures of value
inverted.
The sheets printed with the 25 para value contained 12 stamps. The largest piece still
existing is a block of nine stamps. One of the three missing copies was found later and put
with the other nine stamps. This part sheet of ten copies is now in my collection.
The first date of this issue is 19th March, 1914. The last date is 16th April, 1914. The black
and blue prints, only existing on envelopes, belong to the end of the period. Violet
prints were also then still in use.
The Albanian Skanderbeg stamps were again received in Korytsa on 17th April, 1914.
The handstamps used for printing these temporary emergency postage stamps were then
rendered unfit for use, and sent to the Director of the Albanian Post in Durazzo.

The Italian and Austrian troops, and the Dutch officer instructors, assisted the new Albanian
Government until the departure of the Albanian King, Prince Wilhelm von Wied, who left
Albania on 4th September, 1914. The beginning of the Great War saw the end of the Kingdom
of Albania under the Prince von Wied. The Italian troops and the Dutch officers followed
von Wied's example and left Albania soon afterwards. As a result of the desertion of
many of the Albanian military police the Dutch major Snellen van Vollenhoven could not
keep Korytsa, and in June 1914 he had been forced to retreat with the remainder of his troops.
Fig. 16

\section{THE GREEK POST (second part) (1914-16)}

The Greeks returned to the Korytsa district and in September 1914 a set of fifteen attractive
stamps from 1 lepton to 25 drachmai was issued in Moschopolis, situated north west of
Korytsa. My collection contains a registered cover (fig. 16) with the values 5, (2 x.) 10 and
30 lepta, sent by P. Gyparos, Commander of Moschopolis, on 28th October, 1914, from
Moschopolis to London, where it arrived on 25th November, 1914. The 5 and 10 lepta have
the normal postmark 'Moschopolis'. The 30 lepta is obliterated with the handstamp
'Autonomous Epirus 24-6-14 occupation of Moschopolis'. The second 5 lepta is obliterated
with the handstamp 'Field-postoffice Epirus'.
Another set was issued in October 1914 in Chimarra. This time it was well printed and
showed the portrait of the Greek King Constantine (fig. 17). The set contains eleven values of fifty stamps. The two 5 and 10 lepta were printed in the combination of one vertical row
of five stamps of 5 lepta; six vertical rows of five stamps of the 10 lepta; and three vertical
rows of five stamps of 2 lepta. The 20 lepta and 1 drachma were also printed in this manner.
The sheet of fifty stamps is constituted as follows: six vertical rows of five stamps of
20 lepta; 4 vertical rows of five stamps of 1 drachma.
Fig. 17 Fig. 19
I have seen cancellations of Chimarra dated 15th October, 8th and 23rd November, 1914.
Delvino, Argyrocastro, Korytsa and some other towns used during 1915 and 1916 the
Greek stamps issued in 1911 and 1913, with a vertical or horizontal overprint 'N. Epirus'.
I also have a cover (fig. 18) sent in May 1915 from Delvina via Santi Quaranta to the isle of
Korfu. Such real covers are scarce.
Furthermore a second definitive issue, showing a double eagle, was in use. This set
contained eight values and two more stamps of the same type, but with the supplementary
indication 'Korytsa'. These issues remained in use from 1914 until the end of the Greek
occupation in 1916.

Fig. IS

As the state of Epirus has never been recognised by the other nations we have to consider
all these stamps as belonging to Albania.

\section{THE FRENCH POST (1916-18)}

Towards the end of 1916 the French and Italian troops forced the Greeks to leave South
Albania and give up the Republic of Epirus. The Italians occupied Valona and Argyrocastro;
the French kept the eastern part of South Albania and created the Republic of
Korytsa.

At first some remainders of Greek stamps with overprint N. Epirus were overprinted
again; this time with a small primitive double eagle in two types and the new value in
centimes (fig. 19). There were now two different stamps of lOc. and three different stamps
of 25c. One of the 25c. overprints became the rarest stamp of Albania, with a quotation of
2,750 francs Yvert for mint and 2,000 francs used. My copies are cancelled: December
1916 and January 1917.

Next a set of eight stamps was issued. The sheets of twelve stamps contained twelve
different types. The 5c. of the first print showed on the third stamp of the first row the error
'inverted V in the word 'Vetqeveritare', (fig. 20), which error does not exist in later prints
of this issue. The inscription was 'Shqiperie Vetqeveritare' and means 'Independent Albania'.

The second set with the more logical inscription 'Republika Shqipetare' (fig. 21) was also
printed in sheets of twelve stamps and contained the same different types of double eagle
and frame as the first set.

Fig. 20 Fig. 21
A 25c. stamp was not included in this set, and was replaced by two supplementary values,
which must be considered as errors. They show 2 and 3 ctm, instead of 2 or Sets.
In 1918 the 5c. of the second issue was overprinted with the missing value 25c. Furthermore
a 25c. was issued with an altered inscription. The new inscription was 'quarku i
korces' and means 'Surroundings of Korytsa'. Both overprints exist in many different types
of the overprint and the twelve different types of the stamp itself. All these stamps had
values in French currency.
At the end of the First World War the Repepublic of Korytsa, created by the French, again
became a part of the Republic of Albania.

As the Albanian troops occupied Tepeleni during May 1914 special stamps ceased to be
issued. Tepeleni is situated south east of Valona, and official handstamp stamps were used,
as had happened in Korytsa. Envelopes also were overprinted with a handstamp of the
Prefecture of Tepeleni. Since the envelopes showed different colours, many shades of paper
are possible. The value 1 Grosch was put on by a separate handstamp. Normally both
handstamps had the same blue colour. I have seen copies with value indication in lilac.
The oldest date known is 30th May, 1914 (Fig. 22).
Fig. 22

\section{THE GREEK POST (third part) (1940-41)}

The French expression Thistoire se repete' is confirmed in South Albania by events which
happened in the years 1940 and 1941. During the Balkan war of 1912-13, and twice during
1914-15 in the First World War, South Albania was occupied by the Greeks. In October
1940, Greece was attacked by the Italian army operating from South Albania.
For the fourth time in thirty years the Greek army marched north again, after they had
thrown the Italians out of Greece and driven them back into Albania. Greece occupied
South Albania once more.
In addition to many field post-offices in the military postal sectors four civil post-offices
were opened. At the beginning these offices only issued normal Greek stamps, but later
Greek stamps arrived overprinted 'Greek Administration'. My collection contains covers
and cards franked with Greek stamps without and with this overprint. Further covers without
stamps were used during the campaign by Greek officials; also normal military postcards.
In addition to the Greek military cards, Italian military postcards, which were
captured by the Greeks, were also used by the Greek soldiers. All correspondence was
controlled by a Greek censor. Next to Greek handstamps, they used Albanian ones too.
Fig. 23 shows the Albanian postmark Sarande (Aghyi Saranta) on a Greek stamp with
overprint: Greek Administration.


During the campaign the postmark TAX TOMEYE was also used. TT means postal
sector. The indicated number refers to the concerning military postal sector of the Greek
occupation army in south Albania (Fig. 24).

Fig. 24
The Greeks were thrown back again as soon as the Italians got help from the Germans,
so that the Greek occupation only lasted a couple of months. The four Greek civil postoffices
in Aghyi Saranta, Argyrocastro, Delvino, and Korytsa, which were opened in
December 1940, closed again in April 1941 after the retreat of the Greek army.

\section{THE ITALIAN ALBANIAN POST (1939-43)}

This time the Italians stayed in Albania, including the Southern part, until the capitulation
of Italy in 1943.

Philatelic recollections of this period are normally the Italian stamps issued for Albania
with the portrait of the Italian Emperor-King. As a special philatelic souvenir, I also show
covers franked with the Albanian stamps of those days but used in 1941 during the Italian-
Albanian occupation of Prizren, situated in Yugoslavia just opposite the Albanian border.
I also show an Italian military postcard, the same type as the cards, which was captured by
the Greeks. On this occasion the card bore the indication 'Posta Militare Albania', with
the cancellation 'Officio Posta Militare 99'.

After the Italian capitulation, the remaining Italian-Albanian stamps were overprinted in
connection with the new independence.

\section{THE GERMAN POST (1944-45)}

Some time after the Italian capitulation the German army occupied Albania, but I cannot
show you any philatelic reflection of this period as I have not so far found one. The fights
between the Albanian partisans and the German troops lasted until the Germans gave up
and returned from Albania to their Heimat.
