\section{DUTCH MILITARY MISSION ISSUE 1914}

After the Greeks had left Korytsa and its neighbourhood three members of the Dutch
mission, Snellen van Vollenhoven, Doorman and Mallinckrodt, had to take over the power
and represented the Albanian Government in Korytsa from 18th March, 1914. As stamps
were no longer available in Korytsa it was decided to use existing envelopes and print on
them the handstamp of the 'Commission de controle provisoire Korea'.

The Albanian double eagle is in the central feature of the design. The value was printed
separately. Two values exist: 10 and 25 para. The normal colour of this issue is a violet
shade. They are much more rare in black, and some covers exist with ththe stamp printed in
blue. The value is always printed in red.

The colours of the envelopes were blue, grey, green, white (fig. 14) or beige. It was permitted
to cut the stamps from the envelope and use them as postage-stamps. The Commission
handstamp was later also printed on sheets of white ungummed paper for the production
of 25 para stamps.

The 10 para stamp is rather scarce. The existing frankings are: 20 para = 2 x 10 para;
35 para = 1 x 10 and 1 x 25 para; 50 para = 2 x 25 para or 5 x 10 para. For inland post
I have seen the frankings of 20 and 35 para. 50 para was needed on covers to other countries.
I have this franking on covers to Holland, Greece and Turkey.

The 10 para is mostly printed on cover or on paper cut from an envelope. The 25 para
from the print on sheets is regularly used on envelopes too. I have a cover sent from Korytsa
to Utrecht (fig. 15).

I have never seen cuttings of the 10 para used on cover. Furthermore I believe that copies
of this value do not exist printed on sheets of paper. The 10 para exist with figures of value
inverted.

The sheets printed with the 25 para value contained 12 stamps. The largest piece still
existing is a block of nine stamps. One of the three missing copies was found later and put
with the other nine stamps. This part sheet of ten copies is now in my collection.
The first date of this issue is 19th March, 1914. The last date is 16th April, 1914. The black
and blue prints, only existing on envelopes, belong to the end of the period. Violet
prints were also then still in use.

The Albanian Skanderbeg stamps were again received in Korytsa on 17th April, 1914.
The handstamps used for printing these temporary emergency postage stamps were then
rendered unfit for use, and sent to the Director of the Albanian Post in Durazzo.

The Italian and Austrian troops, and the Dutch officer instructors, assisted the new Albanian
Government until the departure of the Albanian King, Prince Wilhelm von Wied, who left
Albania on 4th September, 1914. The beginning of the Great War saw the end of the Kingdom
of Albania under the Prince von Wied. The Italian troops and the Dutch officers followed
von Wied's example and left Albania soon afterwards. As a result of the desertion of
many of the Albanian military police the Dutch major Snellen van Vollenhoven could not
keep Korytsa, and in June 1914 he had been forced to retreat with the remainder of his troops.
