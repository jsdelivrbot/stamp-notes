# German Post Offices in the Ottoman Empire

The first country in which Germany
established foreign post offices was the
Turkish Empire, and its philatelic history,
as Mr. Barnsdall puts it, "reflects
the continual fluctuation of exchange of
local currency and the strenuous competition
of the various Powers to capture
the postal traffic." The first office
was opened at Galata, Constantinople,
on March 1st, 1870 and in 1875 a branch
office was opened in Stamboul, or Constantinople
proper. 

The next office was
established at Jaffa on October 1st,
1898, on the occasion of the visit of the
German Emperor, and on March 1st,
1900, offices were opened at Smyrna,
Beirut, Jerusalem, and Pera, the latter
being a suburb of Constantinople.
Beirut, or Beyrouth, is a seaport on
the Mediterranean, in Syria, Turkey in
Asia, situated on a bay at the foot of a
prolongation of the Lebanon, 55 miles
by rail from Damascus, whose port it is.
Beirut is the healthiest place on the
coast having temperate summers and a
plentiful supply of rain in the winters.

It is a town of considerable antiquity
and was at one time a port of the
Phoenicians. It came later under the
power of Egypt, from whom it was
taken by Antiochus the Great, and so
became part of Syria. Conquered for
the Romans by Agrippa, it was made
by Augustus a military colony under
the name of Colonia Julia Augusta
Felix Berytus. During the Crusades it
belonged alternately to the Christians
and to the Saracens. In 1763 it fell into
the power of the Turks; was conquered
by Ibrahim Pasha, son of Mehemet
Ali of Egypt in 1831 ;_ and played
an important part in the Oriental question
in 1840, when it was bombarded on
September 10th by the allied English,
Austrian and Turkish fleets, until
evacuated by the Egyptians. Its modern
growth dates from 1843 when steam
navigation was introduced. It has a
present population of about 150,000,
over one-fourth of whom are Mohammedans.

Constantinople, the capital of the
Ottoman Empire, was founded in 330
 D. by Constantine the Great, from
whom it derives its name. The city
consists of two distinct partsâ€”-Stamboul
or Constantinople proper, and
Christian Constantinople (Pera, Galata,
and Top-hana). The two are separated
by the Golden Horn, a creek about five
miles long and half a mile wide at the
entrance, a safe and spacious harbor,
and so deep that large ironclads can
lie quite close to the shore. Stamboul
lies on the southern side of the Golden
Horn and Christian Constantinople on
the northern side. The two are connected
by a couple of rude but convenient
bridges. The old walls, in
courses of stone and red brick, and 14
miles in circuit, show that the modern
Turkish city occupies much the same
area as the capital of the first Christian
emperor. Within these walls the city
rises, like Rome, upon seven low hills,
crowned by noble mosques, with a
wilderness of picturesque, tumbledown,
filthy wooden houses and bazaars
climbing up their sides. In
Stamboul are nearly all the monuments
and antiquities worth seeing in Constantinople.

In 330 A. D., impressed
by its magnificent site, Constantine
the Great abandoned the old capital of
the Roman Empire on the Tiber, and
founded in the place of Byzantium a
new metropolis on the Bosphorus
which he called Constantinople. Its
walls and public buildings were enlarged
and beautified by Justinian in
587-565. Since then it has undergone
many sieges by Sassanians, Persians,
Avars, Saracens (six times), Russians
(in 9th to 11th Centuries), Latins and
Turks ; and of its twenty-six sieges and
eight captures, that of the Latins under
Baldwin and Dandolo in 1304 was by
far the most disastrous, barbarous and
spoliating. In comparison, the Turkish
'sieges were humane and chivalrous
:
the first took place in 1356; Murad II
made the attempt again in 1422; and
Mohammed II carried the city in 1453.
Galata, at which the first German
post office was established, is pre-eminently
the merchant quarter, and it was
founded in 1216 by a colony of Genoese
merchants. The Tower of Galata, a
Genoese erection, serves the same purpose
as the Seraskier's Tower on the
opposite side in giving alarms of fires.
A tunnelled railway drags passengers
up the steep ascent to Pera.
Pera is the aristocratic quarter ; here
are ail the embassies and consulates.
The steep and badly paved Grande Rue
is lined with fair if expensive shops,
and boasts a rude opera house, many
cafes and restaurants, and most of the
principal hotels. The total population
of Constantinople probably exceeds a
million and a quarter, and at least half
of the inhabitants are Mohammedans.
Jaifa, or Joppa as it was known in
Biblical times, is a town on the seacoast
of Syria, 37 miles north-west of
Jerusalem. Under Constantine the
place, which had been destroyed by
Vespasian, became a bishop's see, and,
as the Crusaders' great landing place,
was taken and retaken by Christian and
Moslem. In 1799 Napoleon stormed
it; in 1833, it was taken by Mehemet
AH, and restored to the Turks by
British help. The open roadstead, the
ancient walls, the yellow sand-dunes,
and the orange gardens are now the
chief features of the brown town on its
hillock. The population is estimated
at about 40,000. There is a regular
German colony near the town and although
it only numbers some three
hundred souls it was established so
long ago as 1869.
Jerusalem, regarded as a holy city
alike by Jews, Christians and Moslems,
long the capital of Palestine, stands on
the spurs of two hills surrounded and
divided by two valleys, once deep, but
now partly or wholly filled up with rubbish.
The Eastern Hill was originally
a rounded tpp crowned with the
"threshing floor of Aruanah," and the
rock and cave, probably a sacred site
from time immemorial. The Western
Hill, higher than the other by more
than a hundred feet, was also bounded
by steep slopes. Either hill was, therefore,
a strong hill-fortress. The history
of Jerusalem covers a period of
about 3,500 years. Of these 500 at
least are prehistoric; and of the 3O0O
years which remain, less than 500 show
us Jerusalem independent, the capital
of a free country, and the center of a
national religion. For 60O years longer
the city was in the hands of the
Israelites, but never wholly independent.
Its name is found on an inscriotion
at least 500 years before David;
it was besieged almost immediately
after the death of Joshua (1400 B. C.)
and was the constant centre of strife
until 586 B. C, when it was entirely destroyed.
Fifty years later it was rebuilt
but for 500 years after this Jerusalem
knew not a single generation of
peace. Internal factions tore it to
pieces ; the city was in possession in
turn of Persian, Macedonian, Syrian,
Egyptian, and Roman. Under Antiochus
the temple was consecrated to
Zeus Olympius ; and swine were sacrificed
on the altars. But for the Maccabees,
the religion of the Jews would
have been abandoned and their nationality
lost. The city was besieged,
taken, and again totally destroyed by
Titus in 70 A. D. In 134 A. D., the
rebellion of Bar Cocheba was the signal
for another devastation ; but in 136
Hadrian rebuilt the city, called it
Aelia Capitolina, and generally paganised
it. When the empire eventually
became Christian, pilgrimages to the
holy place increased greatly in number,
and in 333 the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre was founded. In 614, Jerusalem
was attacked by the Persians,
and in 637 it passed into the power of
Islam, falling to the Caliph Omar.
The Arab overlords were on the whole
not unfriendly to the Christians, and
the city was well cared for under them;
but when the Seljuk Turks came into
power, their oppression of the pilgrims
became a challenge to the Christian
powers, and the crusades were the results.

Godfrey of Bouillon rescued
the city in 1099, but it was retaken by
Saladin in 1187. From 1347, it was
subject to Egypt for two hundred and
seventy years, but eventually fell to the
Sultan Selim I in 1517. In 1835, there
was a partially successful revolt
against the Turkish despotism, but in
1849 the authority of Turkey was con
firmed by the powers. Of late years
the city has become the rendezvous of
thousands of exiled Jews, mainly from
Russia. Its present population is about
50,000.
Smyrna, the most important seaport
of Asia Minor, stands at the head of
the Gulf of Smyrna, which penetrates
46 miles inland from the Aegean Sea.
It was founded, probably about 1000' B.
C, by Achaen or yEolian colonists
from Greece, though it subsequently
became Ionian. Early in the 7th century
B. C, it resisted the Lydian king,
Gyges ; but in 627 B. C., his grandson,
Alyattes, took the city and utterly destroyed
it. At last it was restored by
Lysimachus, early in the 3rd century
B. C. It then became one of the finest
cities in Asia Minor. From the
Romans it received privileges because
of its fidelity in their wars with Mithridates.
In 178 and 180 A. D., it
suffered greatly from earthquakes. A
Christian church was established there
at an early date. In 1084, Smyrna was
captured by a Turkish chief, and then
nearly destroyed by a Greek fleet.
The emperor Alexis Comnenus restored
it; afterwards it suffered much
from a siege by Tamerlane (1402), and
in 1424 fell into the hands of the Turks.
Smyrna was one of the towns claimed
to be the birthplace of Homer. About
2700 years ago Smyrna was one of the
principal trading centres for Asia
Minor; and now it has as a seaport the
lion's share of the Asia Minor trade
with Europe. The harbor is large,
safe, and easily accessible, but is in imminent
danger of siltinsr up. 

It has an estimated population of about a quarter of a million of whom 130,000 are Greeks (more than the population of Athens), 23,000 Jews, 12,000 Armenians, 12,700 Europeans, and the rest Turks.
