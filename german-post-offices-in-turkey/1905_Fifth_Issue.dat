The Fifth Issue.
Although the new "DEUTSCHES
REICH" stamps were issued for the
German Empire in April, 1902, it was
not until October 1st, 1905, that any of
them were issued with the Turkish
overprints. The same values were surcharged
as before but, following the
system also applied to the Chinese and
Moroccan offices, fancy Gothic or German
lettering was used in place of the
Latin characters which had sufficed to
that date. On all values up to and including
the 4 piastres the words were
placed below the numerals thus reversing
the plan of the previous set. The
overprint on the 3 mark value was in
red as before.
