The Second Issue.
At the time that the new surface
printed stamps were placed on sale in
Germany (October 1st, 1889), the sanie
series overprinted with new values in
Turkish currency was placed on sale in
the Levant offices. The values were the
same as before and the overprints on
the two lower values were somewhat
similar, in fact, the 20 para overprint is
so like that of 1884 that it would seem
to have been applied by the same form.
The 10 para surcharge now has letters
and figures of the same size. In the
case of the "1 PIASTER 1" surcharge
the numerals are smaller and the letters
larger than before. A different arrangement
was followed for the two
highest values the word "PIASTER"
occupying a line by itself with the value
at each side a little above the "P" and
"R".
1889.
