# 1844 First Issue

The first German stamps overprinted
for use in the Turkish post offices were
not issued until January 25th, 1884.
From 1870, when the first office was established
at Constantinople, until that
date ordinary current German stamps
were used (the issues of the North
German Confederation of 1869, and of
the German Empire from 1872 until
1880). Mr. Barnsdall gives the reason
for the overprinted stamps as follows:
In time it was discovered that a
large number of these stamps were
not bought for postal purposes, but
were used for making remittances to
Germany, the difference of exchange
enabling remitters to buy the stamps
under face value, whilst at the same
time this mode of remittance avoided
the fee for money orders. To counteract
this the stamps supplied to the
offices were overprinted with the approximate
value in Turkish currency.

This had the double effect of stopping
the practice referred to above,
and for some time of attracting additional
local custom. The latter was
by reason of the fact that these overprinted
German stamps were sold at
the facial Turkish currencv without
regard tO' fluctuation of exchange.

The stamps overprinted were the 5,
10, 30, 25 and 50pf values of the issue
of 1880 with value in "pfennig." The
3pf was not overprinted as the value
was not required by Postal Union rates,
neither was the 2 mark value surcharged
as this value was not sold to
the public and therefore could not be
used for remittances. The surcharge
consisted of the word "PARA" or
"PIASTER" with numerals before and
after printed in black. There are two
types of the overprint of the IJ^ and
zyi piastres, one having the numerals
further from the word than the other
so that one type is about 2 mm. longer
than the other. At least three different
shades of the 50pf were surcharged and
the ink used for the overprint on this
denomination varied from dull to shiny
according to which would show to the
best advantage on the particular green
of the stamp. A small supply of the 1
pias on 20pf was surcharged in deep
blue instead of black by error. There
are dangerous reprints of these overprints
so that they should be purchased
only from responsible concerns.
