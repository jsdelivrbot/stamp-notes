The Fourth Issue.
In March, 1903, the 1 and 5 pias
values of the preceding set appeared
with some slight modifications in the
type of the surcharge. The most
prominent feature of the new type is
the "A" of "PIASTER" which has a
conspicuous horizontal serif across its
top. The 25 pias with similar overprint
appeared about a month later while the
10 and 20 para values were not issued
until November, 1904. The only other
denomination to be issued with this
type of surcharge was the 10 pias which
was not placed on sale until June, 1905.
