The Seventh Issue.
In August, 1908, a regular surprise
set appeared in the shape of five denominations
surcharged with new
values in "centimes" instead of the
usual paras and. piastres. Although
many ingenious theories were adduced
at the time of their issue to account for
their special use these are so conflicting
that we are still in the dark as to the
actual raison d'etre of the set. The
surcharges are all in fancy Gothic type
and are placed on the stamps diagonally,
reading upwards from left to
right.
