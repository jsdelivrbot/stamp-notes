# 1908 The Seventh Issue, Values in Centimes

In August, 1908, a regular surprise set appeared in the shape of five denominations
surcharged with new values in "centimes" instead of the usual paras and piastres. Although
many ingenious theories were adduced at the time of their issue to account for
their special use these are so conflicting that we are still in the dark as to the
actual raison d'etre of the set. The surcharges are all in fancy Gothic type and are placed on the stamps diagonally, reading upwards from left to right.
