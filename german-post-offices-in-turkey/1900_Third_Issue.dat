The Third Issue.
With each change of stamps for the
"Fatherland" it naturally follows that
those in use in the foreign post-offices
should be altered hence when the "Germania"
and pictorial stamps appeared
in 1900 the series was suitably overprinted
for use in the Levant. The 2pf
and 3pf values were not required but
the values above 50pf were all surcharged
so that this third issue is a much more comprehensive one than its
predecessors. Both types of the 5
mark value were overprinted. The surcharges,
with the exception of that on
the 3 mark denomination, were m black
while on the 3 mark, owing to its color,
red was used. The word "PARA' or
"PIASTER" is slightly higher than the
numerals on all values. The word is
in capitals except on the V/i, V/2 and
W/2 values when it is "Piaster.' _ On
the 3 mark stamp the surcharge is 15
PIASTER 15" reading upwards on the
left side and downwards on the right.
