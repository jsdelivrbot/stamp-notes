#The Third Issue.

With each change of stamps for the
"Fatherland" it naturally follows that
those in use in the foreign post-offices
should be altered hence when the "Germania"
and pictorial stamps appeared
in 1900 the series was suitably overprinted
for use in the Levant. The 2pf
and 3pf values were not required but
the values above 50pf were all surcharged
so that this third issue is a much more comprehensive one than its
predecessors.

Both types of the 5

with the exception of that on
the 3 mark denomination, were m black
while on the 3 mark, owing to its color,
red was used. The word "PARA' or
"PIASTER" is slightly higher than the
numerals on all values. The word is
in capitals except on the V/i, V/2 and
W/2 values when it is "Piaster.

It was intentionally produced in the Fall of 1903 by the Reichs Post Printing Office for "pattern purposes" after a doubly surcharged sheet of the 5 Mark was unknowingly sold in Constantinople. The Reichs Postal Bureau doubted its authenticity and began an investigation, during the course of which this error was produced. However, the original error was on the Ty. I stamp, but the Reichs Post Printing Office produced these double surcharges on the Ty. II stamp. In addition, half of the sheet of 20 received the Type I surcharge and the other half received the Type II surcharges with the bar over the "A". This sheet of 20 was then passed on to the Reichs Postal Museum, whereupon eighteen copies were given away to unofficial recipients. Signed Boden, Mohrmann and Bothe, also accompanied by a 1979 Bothe certificate; ex-Morhrmann, Schnell (Michel #23I II DD; €12,000). (Image)	$9,750.00
