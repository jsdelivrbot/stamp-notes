The German post offices abroad were a network of post offices in foreign countries established by Germany to provide mail service where the local services were deemed unsafe or unreliable. They were generally set up in cities with some sort of German commercial interest. They started appearing in the late 19th century and reached their heyday at the beginning of the 20th century; they closed down during or shortly after World War I.

It was not unusual for countries to maintain such offices in other countries; countries with similar offices abroad include Austria-Hungary, China, France, Greece, Italy, Romania, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the latter part of 19th century and into the 20th century, having extraterritorial post offices was one indication of a nation's international power.[1]

Stamps from German post offices abroad are popular with collectors and some are quite valuable. 
The highest price paid for a single stamp has been for the 40 
Pfennig Germania hand-stamped "China" (Tientsin issue) from 1900 
that realized 100,152 Euros at a 2006 auction.[2]

On March 1, 1870, the Norddeutscher Postbezirk opened the first office in Constantinople (Istanbul) using definitive stamps without overprint. After January 1872, the Reichspost took over the management of the office and expanded it further as "Deutsche Post in der Turkei". Reichspost definitive stamps were used, after 1884 with overprints in the local denomination, piaster and para, after 1908 in French centimes. No country overprints were issued. With the entry of Turkey into WWI the offices were closed on September 9, 1914.[8]

After German unification in 1870, Germany began to seek the trappings of a great power: colonies, spheres of influence and offices abroad.

Kaiser Wilhelm II (1888-1918) launched the Berlin-to-Baghdad railway, for which the Ottoman sultan granted German companies the right to construct railways through Ottoman territory. The railroad symbolized German economic and political penetration of the Ottoman Empire.

Germany issued stamps for its offices in the Ottoman Empire beginning in 1884 by overprinting and surcharging German stamps in paras and piasters.
