\#\#\#Burundi

Burundi has been issuing postage stamps for national use since becoming independent on 1 July 1962. Unfortunately it has also been issuing stamps for philatelic topical collectors in quantities which in my opinion make it a country that is not worth collecting. 

The disastrous philatelic politics of Burundi between 1962 and 1977 resulted in the fact that few philatelists still follow the issues of that country, and information are very difficult to obtain. After 1977, the situation completely changed, and less than 200 stamps were issued between 1978 and 1993 (an average of less than 15 stamps a year!).

Some of the earlier issues have some merit and also getting these stamps on non-philatelic covers requires some effort.

The country was formerly a part of the Belgian territory of Ruanda-Urundi and before 1962 used those postage stamps. However, for the first issue under independence, Burundi overprinted the previous set of stamps of Ruanda-Urundi with Royaume du Burundi.[1]

Several issues were produced afterwards printed as "Royaume du Burundi" including a celebration of the Red Cross in 1963.[1]




\subsection{Republic of Burundi}

In 1967, Burundi became a republic following the 1967 Burundian revolution and from then the stamps were printed as Republique du Burundi.[1]
