\chapter{Air Mails}
I am very
greatly indebted to an article by B. S. H. GRANT in the London Philatelist and to material published by Mr. Francis J. Field, 
in 1939 in the Aero Field for many of the details I am able to give.
On many of the flights, very little mail was conveyed, sometimes being less than a
hundred pieces, and rarely more than two hundred, on some of the internal and first flights.
It is therefore by no means easy to secure a complete collection of all the various stages if certain flights are to be included, and many of these internal flight covers of this period are consequently rare. The limited number of collectors, however, who specialise in the airmails of this particular country means that, with patience, it should be possible to get
together quite a good representative selection at least, in spite of the scarcity of such covers.
There is, also, a sufficient variety to add a spice of interest in them, to create a happy "off
the catalogue" hunting ground.

First of all, the air mail stamps. These are not numerous, and the first overprinted
10 aur stamp of 1928 was issued on May 31st ready for the first flight from Reykjavik to
Akureyri a few days later. In the following year, the 50 aur stamp was similarly overprinted with a plane to provide for the needs of registration.

 3-strip 1928 10 aur Christian X with Airplane Overprint on 2 June 1928 combination FIRST DAY COVER and FIRST FLIGHT COVER. Not only is this a first flight cover, it is the FIRST ICELANDIC INLAND AIRMAIL FLIGHT! Some literature (for example, Facit) states that the stamp was issued 31 May. However, Luning explains that while some records show that date, no examples used earlier than 2 June have ever been found and states that 2 June is considered the first day of issue. Facit does not list any FDCs before 1929, but Luning does list C1 on FDC as 2 June. While there are many later similar-looking first flights between various towns, this 2 June canceled Reykjavik to Akureryi flight (actually flown on 4 June, with 4 June arrival backstamp, due to bad weather) is the very first in the long history of inland Icelandic aviation. The return flight was not so lucky; the airplane, the "Sulan" was brought down by engine trouble and arrived back in Reykjavik being towed by a fishing boat! (ex Jay Smith). $250.

On January 1, 1930, a rather handsome triangular 10 aur (falcon) blue air mail stamp was issued, this stamp also being overprinted for official use, the only air stamp so far to be so treated. This was followed in June by the set of five commemorative stamps in connection with the millenary celebrations at Thingvellir.

The next set of air mail stamps came out in 1934 of a pictorial nature and these were
valid until 1947 when the current issue illustrating various types of planes over parts of
Iceland appeared. In addition to these normal issues, special provision by means of suitable overprints was made in connection with the Graf Zeppelin and Balbo special flights in 1931 and 1933. It will be seen, therefore, that the number of air stamps is not excessive and, unlike so many similar issues in other countries, were actually required for legitimate use.

We will now take the internal air services. An attempt to form an air service was made
in 1919, when Captain Cecil Farber, an English pilot, visited Iceland with his aeroplane,
the first seen in the island, but the proposed commercial air service fell through, and it
was not until 1928 that the Icelandic Air Transport Company was formed, and the matter
was seriously taken up. A Junkers F 13 seaplane was obtained, and trial flights made in
May of that year.

On June 4th the first air mail started from Reykjavik to Akureyri with stops at Isafjordur
and Siglufjordur, and Akureyri was successfully reached the same day. On June 5th the
return flight was attempted, but owing to engine trouble the seaplane came down in the
sea near Akrar on the west coast, and had to be towed to Reykjavik two days later.

Although
this was not very promising, the service did operate quite well throughout the summer
and the seaplane flew over 16,000 miles in those three months.
A special mail flight also took place from Reykjavik to Vestmannaeyjar and back on
June 9th, followed by a special round flight covering Reykjavik and the north and east of
Iceland between June 26th and 28th, and covers of this latter flight are very scarce. Another
flight from Reykjavik to Stykkisholmur is believed to have taken place on June 8th, but
I have not been able to trace flown covers or find out if any were carried.
In the following summer of 1929, three more flights took place. An additional seaplane
had now been acquired, and on July 3rd/4th, mail was flown over a much wider area
covering the west, north, and east coasts in one day in each direction. On July 6th Bildahur
(between Reykjavik and Isafjordur) was included. On August 31, 1929, a flight was made
from Reykjavik to Stykkisholmur and back. All this time the regular service between
Reykjavik and Akureyri started the previous year was functioning.

The summer of 1930 saw the millenary celebrations at Thingvellir. A natural outcome
was that an air service between there and Reykjavik was inaugurated, and during the three
days the celebrations were on, a special air mail service operated. A special post office was
installed at Thingvellir (Pingvellir) and a special postmark incorporating the millenary
badge was issued.

On October 30th special flights took place from Dyrafirdi to Reykjavik via the north
coast. Some covers from Dyrafirdi were postmarked by mistake "October 57" and had to
be corrected by hand to "17." On June 12, 1931, another special flight successfully took
place from Hvammstangi to Reykjavik. Only 125 covers were carried. All these interesting

flights had demonstrated the possibility of quicker communication between the various
towns and villages along the coast, and as opportunity offered, services were continued.
On July 30, 1939, a special glider flight took place between Sandskeid-Reykjavik, and
when the war intervened shortly afterwards, those internal flights still operating were
brought to an abrupt conclusion, to be resumed after the conclusion of hostilities. At
the present time there are in operation air mail services covering almost the whole of
Iceland, so that the early experimental flights and the experience gained resulted in something
useful being evolved.

There are four major Atlantic flights and one Graf Zeppelin flight of this period
involving Iceland which are worth recording.

Early in June, 1929, the Swedish airman, Captain Ahrenberg, calling on his way from
Sweden to America via Iceland and Greenland, carried a small mail to Ivigut in Greenland.
He was attempting to make the first Transatlantic flight by the Arctic route, and a special
mail of 65 letters was made up for him to take from Reykjavik to America. Bad weather
caused him to return to Reykjavik, and a second attempt, on June 26th, resulted in a
further setback and, due to engine trouble, caused another return. A new engine having
been obtained from Germany, he reached Ivigut, Greenland, on July 9th, where the flight
was abandoned, and the mail forwarded by steamer to New York, which was reached on
September llth. The postage on these registered letters was heavy—27 kr. 20aur—and,
no doubt, accounted for the small mail taken.
On July 1, 1931, the Graf Zeppelin paid a visit to Iceland, and mails were exchanged at
Reykjavik. The Zeppelin could not land, so the mail was let down from the airship, and the
Iceland mail was taken aboard by means of a rope and a pail. Three specially overprinted
stamps were issued for this occasion.

On July 12, 1933, the famous Balbo Mass Formation Flight from Rome to U.S.A.
called at Reykjavik where 280 pieces of mail were taken aboard. Three specially overprinted
stamps were also issued for this occasion.

On August 20, 1934, Dr. R. U. Light, with a companion, R. F. Wilson, left New Haven,
Conn., in a Bellanca seaplane on a round-the-world flight. Iceland was reached on
August 31st and the Postmaster-General requested him to convey a mail to Great Britain.
Dr. Light carried 188 letters to Edinburgh, which was reached 36 hours after leaving
Reykjavik on September 5th. On arrival at Edinburgh, the mail was offloaded and forwarded
by the British Post Office.

The last of these interesting flights took place in August, 1935, when the Norwegian-
American airman Thor Solberg made a crossing from New York to Bergen, calling at
Reykjavik on August 3rd. A special air mail of 233 letters was made up at Reykjavik, and
successfully conveyed to Bergen, which was reached on August 16th.
In all these five cases, the usual special cachets and postmarks were applied, and all
mail was officially authorised.

In conclusion, I venture to suggest the period I have covered is most interesting, and
had a great influence on the future aerial development of Iceland. During a large part of
the war, mail was carried normally by air to Great Britain, although there is nothing on
the covers to indicate whether they came by air or sea. Since 1947, American Air Services
have operated the North Atlantic, using Iceland as a calling place, whilst the Icelandic
Air Traffic Company and the Norwegian Air Company also convey mail between Iceland
and Scandinavia.

In 1993 a set celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Icelandic Air Posts was issued.

The following is a check list which may be helpful to those desiring to form a collection,which can be considerably augmented if the intervening stages of the flights and rates are included.
