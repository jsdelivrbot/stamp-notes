\textit{Geography}:--  Iceland, in Icelandic Island, is a large island about half as big again as Ireland and situate between latitude 62° and 67° North and between longitude 13° and 23° West of Greenwich. Only a tiny part of the north-eastern peninsula or Rifstangi and the islet of Grimsey lie within the Arctic Circle, and Iceland is in fact a westerly rather than a northerly isle. Its eastern extremity lies indeed west of any other part of Europe, excepting the Azores.{{wi: Iceland}}

Iceland is roughly oval in shape, the centre being almost entirely barren and uninhabited,
consisting of vast glaciers, lava and snowfields. Volcanoes and hot springs abound, but
there have been no serious volcanic eruptions for some years. Many of the coastal strips
are fertile and agriculture flourishes in the lowlands of the south-west. The north and
west coasts each have two large bays, besides innumerable smaller inlets. The east coast is
more rugged with a series of narrow firths (fjords) comparable with those of western
Norway, whilst the north-western peninsula, joined to the rest of Iceland by a very narrow
isthmus, has one major inlet (fsafjorQur) and a host of smaller fjords, where the scenery
is of a rugged grandeur. The south coast, likewise the north-east, is by contrast free of
indentations.

The chief centres of population are the south-west, where the capital Reykjavik lies, with its considerable agricultural hinterland; the north-west and east, where the fishing industry flourishes, with centres at fsafjor6ur and Sey3isfjor9ur; and the northern bays, with Akureyri the principal town. The whole population, however, is even to-day only about 130,000, of whom over a quarter live in Reykjavik. No other town has as many as 5,000 inhabitants.

The population of the island is believed to have varied from 40,000–60,000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times.[8] According to Bryson (1974), there were 37 famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804.[133] The first census was carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50,358. After the destructive volcanic eruptions of the Laki volcano during 1783–84, the population reached a low of about 40,000.[134] Improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th century—from about 60,000 in 1850 to 320,000 in 2008. Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country, with one out of five people being 14 years-old or younger. With a fertility rate of 2.1, Iceland is one of only a few European countries with a birth rate sufficient for long-term population growth (see table on the left).[135][136]


\section{History}

Only a brief historical summary need be given here. Iceland was colonised
from Norway in the ninth century A.D., and also from Ireland, a fact commemorated in
the name Vestmannaeyjar, or Isles of the Westmen, given to a group of islands off the
south coast. A National Parliament, the Althing (Aiding), was founded in A.D. 930, and
met annually at E>ingvellir (Meeting Plains) some 20 miles east of Reykjavik. The influence
of Norway was however strong, and in 1262 Icelanders swore an oath of allegiance to
Haakon IV, King of Norway\footnote{Kaakon who ruled for 46 years employed an active and aggressive foreign policy, and at the end of his rule added Iceland and the Norse Greenland community to his kingdom, leaving Norway at its territorial height. Although he for the moment managed to secure Norwegian control of the islands off the northern and western shores of Great Britain, he fell ill and died when wintering in Orkney following some military engagements with the expanding Scottish kingdom.}.

When Norway was united under the Danish Crown by the
Treaty of Kalmar in 1397, Iceland "went with it," but when the King of Denmark ceded
Norway to Sweden by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814, Iceland, together with Greenland and
the F\`aer\`oe Islands, was expressly stated to remain under the Danish Crown.
Throughout the nineteenth century Iceland struggled to achieve a measure of independence
from Danish rule, which was often neither benevolent nor beneficent. Iceland
was indeed in the main a sadJy neglected country arid remained in a very backward state.
Trade with Iceland was the King's monopoly, farmed out annually till 1786, when it
was thrown open to Danish and Icelandic merchants subject to elaborate regulations. In
1854 it was made free to all nations, but lack of regular communications hampered its
development for twenty years or more.

The management of Icelandic affairs in the eighteenth century was entrusted to the
King's "Rentekammer" or "Income Office," a branch of the Treasury, except between
1773 and 1781 when the authority was the "Rente- og General-Toldkammer" or Customs
Office. In 1848 the administration passed to the Danish Ministry of Internal Affairs and
in 1855 to the Ministry of Justice.

Politically, the Icelanders made some advance in 1843 by securing the re-constitution
of the ancient Parliament or Aiding, albeit only in a consultative capacity, and the King
of Denmark, who exercised the powers of an absolute monarch, often rejected the Airing's
advice. As the Aiding only met in alternate (odd) years, the King found procrastination
a simple matter.

The democratic Constitution granted to the Danish people on June 5, 1849, was also
offered to the Icelanders, but rejected, because its basis, the treatment of Iceland as an
integral part or province of Denmark, was deemed unacceptable. It was not until 1873
that the Aiding was granted jurisdiction over certain domestic affairs, the King being
represented by a Governor (Landshof6ingi), but the real control remained with the
Ministry of Justice in Copenhagen.

The Icelanders progressed a further step towards independence in 1904, when the
advent of a Liberal Government in Denmark resulted in the appointment of a Minister
for Iceland (Radherra Islands) resident in Reykjavik.

On December 1, 1918, by a treaty between Danes and Icelanders, Iceland became an
independent Kingdom, joined to Denmark by a personal union in the form of a common
King. Exceptionally, Iceland continued to conduct her foreign affairs through the Danish
Foreign Office and its diplomatic and consular services; but certain ministries were not
immediately divorced from Danish control, the Post Office, for example, not until
January 1, 1920, in accordance with the Postal Law of November 28, 1919, and the
reciprocal agreement between Iceland and Denmark of the same date.

The final chapter remains to be written, but since the German occupation of Denmark
Iceland has announced her intention to become a fully independent Republic.
In order to follow the development of the postal service in Iceland it is necessary to
have a broad knowledge of the geographical division and administration of the country.
From ancient times Iceland was divided into quarters (fj'6rdungir): North, East, South
and West. Up to 1770 a single Sheriff (Amtmadur), resident at Bessastadir, near Reykjavik,
controlled all four provinces, under a higher official resident at Copenhagen. In 1770 the
administration was divided, one Sheriff being made responsible for North and East
(Nordur- og Austuramt) with residence, from 1783, at Fri3riksgafa, adjoining Modruvellir,
near Akureyri; the second retaining the former residence at Bessastadir and controlling
the South and West (Su5ur- og Vesturamt). In addition the latter was made Stiftamtmadur
or High Sheriff of all Iceland. In 1787 a separate Sheriff was appointed for Vesturamt.
The High Sheriff moved his residence from Bessastadir to Reykjavik in 1811, and on
April 1, 1873, his title was changed to Landshofdingi, or Governor (see above),
and again in 1904 his title and function was changed to Minister for Iceland (RaQherra
Islands).

Each province (Amt) consisted of a number of counties (Syslur) administered by bailiffs
(Syslumenn). These counties are nineteen in number, but six of them were at one time or
another divided into halves, so that for geographical purposes there are twenty-five. On
the other hand, for economy of administration counties were variously grouped in pairs,
e.g. Gullbringusysla and Kjosarsysla: by contrast Nor6ur-Mulasysla and SuSur-Miilasysla
have been separate entities since 1779.

Counties were in turn sub-divided into districts, though occasionally the civil district
(hreppur) is replaced by the ecclesiastical parish (sveit). A list published in 1930 names
202 hreppar and only 3 sveitir.

In the table of postal offices given later in this article each office will be identified by its
county (sysla) and district (hreppur or, exceptionally, sveit). This is very necessary, as
there is very considerable duplication of the commoner place-names in Iceland. A map
and map-reference for each place will also be included.

\textit{Currency}.---Iceland has always used virtually the same currency as Denmark. In the eighteenth century a multiplicity of coinage was in circulation, all rather confusing, but the basis was 96 skilling (skildingar), equal to 1 riksdaler (rikisdalur). The only other coin that need be mentioned here is the silver crown (krona) fixed by regulation of November 23, 1737, as worth 68 skilling. On March 20, 1815, a law issued a couple of years
earlier in Denmark and Slesvig-Holsten decreed a new basis of 96 rigsbankskilling equal
to I rigsbankdaler, five of the old riksdaler being equal to eight of the new rigsbanksdaler,
based on silver. There was also a paper currency standing, until 1832, at a variable discount
under silver. The silver daler was reckoned equal to two shillings and threepence in British
money, but it must be remembered that the purchasing power or real value was very
different from present-day standards, particularly in the eighteenth century. 

Students of
Danish stamps will recall that the term "rigsbankskilling" and "rigsbankdaler" were
dropped in 1854 in favour of the old "skilling" and "rigsdaler," without any change in
value. They are commonly abbreviated to "sk." and "rd."

On January 1,1875, a new currency was introduced, 100 aurar (plural of eyrir) = 1 kr6na
(plural kr6nur), in Danish \o re and kr\o ne(r). The abbreviated Icelandic forms are aur.
(eyr.) and kr. Conversion from the old currency to the new took the simple form of
1 rikisdalur (rd.) equals 2 kronur, and 1 skilding (sk.) equals 2 aurar (aur.), but owing to the fact that 96 sk. made 1 rd., while 100 aur. make 1 kr., each 12 sk. were reckoned equal to 25, not 24, aur. Thus 13 sk. made 27 aur. and 25 sk. made 52 aur., and so on. This
peculiarity has incidentally a bearing on philately, as the skilling stamps were in use in
Iceland for 19 months after the change of currency—from January 1, 1875, to July 31,
1876—and as two 8 sk. stamps (or four 4 sk. or eight 2 sk. stamps) cost 32 aurar while
one 16 sk. stamp cost 33 aur., the 16 sk. value was naturally very little sold after 1874,
which is one reason why the remainders of the 16 sk. value are relatively large.



Language.--- Icelandic is a complex language with numerous case terminations and
vowel changes. The identification of place-names in oblique cases is therefore not always
easy. The modern Icelandic alphabet consists of 32 letters. \th \TH


Two examples will suffice. First, Isafjorbur (nom.): vio Isafjor5 (ace.) = " near
fsafjordur": 1 fsafirdi (dat.)= "in f." fsafjararsysla (gen.) = "County of t"; and,
secondly, StaSur (nom.) = Place; genit. Stadar; plural, Stadir, genit. StaSa, but dative
StS3um.

Icelandic letters not found in English are t or J, D or 6, and the diphthong M and O.
I resembles English " th " as in " thin "; D " th " as in " the." M is sounded like the long "i" in "mile''; O is the same modified O familiar in Danish and German.

Communications.—The difficulty of land transport from one place to another, frequently
across mountains and torrents, suggests the sea as the most natural link between the
many villages; yet postal communication overland developed more rapidly than coastwise,
owing to the lack of regular sailings. (It must also be recognised that the waters
round Iceland are often stormy and dangerous.) But regular sea communications were
unprofitable and the Danes were reluctant to pay subsidies—a short-sighted policy, as the
commercial development of the country was greatly hampered until the eighteen nineties
by the lack of coastwise steamship lines.

Overland communications were extremely primitive, relying on the packhorse and
postman on foot; winter conditions of travel rendered the maintenance of postal services
between the provinces very difficult and sometimes impossible. There was little or no
choice of route and it is significant that the earliest routes chosen were never materially
altered at any time, even when the mail coach and later the motor car were introduced
on certain sections. Development consisted largely in the establishment of additional
branch routes (aukap6star) serving more towns and villages.

The word "town" is perhaps misleading after British standards, since even places of
relative importance were—and often still are—mere villages or hamlets. Similarly'' villages''
often indicates no more than a single farm or perhaps a small group of farmsteads. The
word "Baer" originally meant a farm, but developed to come to mean "town," as in
Danish where the form is "By," frequent enough in England as a termination to placenames.
Likewise "Sta5ur," so often found in Icelandic place-names, means literally a
"place": the plural form "Sta6ir" is also common. Occasionally both forms are used
for the same name, e.g. J3kinnasta9ur or Skinnastadir; similarly Fossvollur or Fossvellir
