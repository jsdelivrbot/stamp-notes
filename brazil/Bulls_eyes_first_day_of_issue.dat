\section{Date of Issue}    

The accepted first day of issue is the 1 August 1843. Early disputes regarding this date were settled by an article in the \textit{London Philatelist}. Very few stamps
cancelled with this date have survived and no covers are known. A total of six stamps have survived two of the 90 reis, one of the 60 reis and three of the 30 reis.
