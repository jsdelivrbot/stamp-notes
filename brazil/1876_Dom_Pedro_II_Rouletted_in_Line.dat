# 1876 (1-7) Dom pedro II, "Rouletted in Line", "Perc\'e"

Ten years after the perforated Dom Pedro issue, a set of stamps were produced by the American Not Co., utilizing the same plates but perforated with a set of roulettes known as perc\'e. 

The design was critised by the press as they show Dom Pedro II, obviosulsy 10 years younger than he was and the next issu known as the "white beard" was produced with a different portrait.
