The first issue was withdrawn on June 30, 1844 (Napier, 1911), in accordance to a notice published in February 13 of that year. The stamps appear to have been withdrawn from sale on that date, but cancellations can be found struck as late as 1845. Although the stamps were withdrawn they were not demonetized.

The most common cancellation is a double circle postmark wit the word "Correio" and the office name between and the date in the center; another cancellation is in the form of a shield; a third consists of a large straight block of letters about 9mm high; and a fourth of a large oblong, with straight top and botom and rounded at the sides.
