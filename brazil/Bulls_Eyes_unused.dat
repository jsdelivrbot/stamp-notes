30 reis deep black, Early Impression from the First Composite plate, State A, very early printing-the famous mint corner block of four from upper left of sheet (positions 1-2/7-8) with enormous margins all round and in a very deep vibrant shade, showing slight burr rubbing of the ink in top margin, minor bends and slight crease at upper left in margin only and slight stain on position 8, however these are negligible faults of no importance - a magnificent rarity with large part original gum.
