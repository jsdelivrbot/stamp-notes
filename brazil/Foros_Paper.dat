\ph[98%]{../brazil/237-1.jpg}{The Foro's Paper. 30 reis grey, Worn Impression and 90 reis black, Early Impression in a corner block of four, positions 1-2/7-8 and showing the vertical frame line at left and horizontal frame line at top, all applied to a 12 page document mailed on January 14, 1845 from Cabo Frio to the Court in Rio de Janeiro, tied by framed CABO FRIO handstamps (Ayres 1248) in black. The rate totals 390 reis which is explained by the fact that judicial mail was carried at half the normal rate. The page has been restored to prevent further acid ink attack to the adhesives but this remarkable document is an important facet of Brazilian classic philately and is in all senses unique. Cert. Comelli (2003) and Dr. Goeggel.
