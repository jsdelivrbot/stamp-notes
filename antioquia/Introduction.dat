\section{The Stamps and Postal History of Antioquia}


Antioquia was one of the states in the original "United States of Colombia", and is now a department in the northwest of the Republic of Colombia. Prior to the constitution of 1886, Antioquia and the other states were sovereign governments in their own right, and even afterwards retained some rights, such as the management of finances.



\section{Postage Stamps}

Antioquia issued its own postage stamps from 1868 to 1904. Many of the later issues, such as those from 1899, are readily available, but authentic usages on cover are scarce.
