## The Peace and Commerce Issues

Some collectors call these French stamps the Sage series.  Others call them the Peace and Commerce series.

The two names refer to the same stamps, a fascinating series issued by France during the last quarter of the 19th century.  During these remarkable Belle Epoque years, the stamps designed by the winner of a contest represented France and her colonies with an allegorical depiction of Peace and Commerce straddling the globe.


The designer, Jules-Auguste Sage, won a contest sponsored by the French Ministry of Finance.  The Ministry was responding to political calls for a new stamp design that would replace the Ceres stamps, which dated back to the first French stamps of 1849.  We don’t know much of Monsieur Sage, but he may have been on the staff of the Bank of Paris or the Ministry of Finance.

The losing designs… apparently there were just a handful, one of which was the Champlain design later used for the pneumatic post.

The Sage stamps were released for 24 years.  Collectors assign them to one of three different groups.  The first Sage issues debuted March 27, 1876.  Type II was first issued on July 20, 1876 and Type III, which is actually a reprise of Type I, was released between February, 1898, and July, 1900.

Specialists who focus on the differences between these three groups begin by looking at the type at the bottom of the stamp.  Below “Republique Francaise” are the words JA SAGE INV.

Along with the actual Sage stamps and imperforates produced for the colonies were thirteen pieces of postal stationery.

For 24 of the most glittering years France has ever enjoyed, the Sage stamps carried the mail.

## The French Colonial Allegorical Group Type


The Navigation and Commerce issue is a series of key type stamps issued for the colonial territories of France. It was designed by Louis-Eugène Mouchon.

The issue uses a standard design featuring allegorical representations of navigation and commerce. The territory name is imprinted in a rectangular cartouche centered at the bottom of the stamp.

In French colonies, it is the first series of territory-specific postal releases. Adding the territory name helped reduce revenue loss incurred when stamps were purchased in colonies with low-value currencies, then sold or used in colonies with high-valued currencies.

It was first released in 1892, with later releases featuring new color schemes. Dates vary by territory, but by 1900 values start appearing surcharged in red or black ink to use the remaining stocks while colonies then used illustrated stamps.
