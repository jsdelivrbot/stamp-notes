\section{1863-66, The First Issues}

The first issues of this Sovereign State share the dual distinction of being the first stamps issued  by any of the Colombian States, and of being the smallest postage stamps ever issued. Together   with the first issue of Tolima, these are regarded as the most significant and fascinating issues of 
all Colombian States. 

The stamps are not easily available (A mjor collection came at Investphila in 2000? The collection included the first-ever plating of the transfer types and a tentative sheet layout of  the 10 centavos values, plus a full sheet of the 1 peso.

Auction: SW1013 - The Collector's Series 
Lot: 72 Bolívar. 1863-66, 1p. red, a stunning block of seven, types 3-6 / 10-12, very fresh with clear to large margins on three sides, just faintly clipped at top left, tied to piece by very fine strikes of ''SINCELEJO'' straight-line in purple. Illustrated on page 22 of Dr. Gene Scott's Colombian States handbook. Scissor cut between adhesives at left of the bottom row, faint diagonal crease and negligible surface rubbing affecting the upperright adhesive, in no way detracting from this rarity. The second largest recorded multiple used, showing the only example known of this cancellation in existence, which further enhances this showpiece's desirability. Cert. Bortfeldt. Scott 3. Ex "Esmeralda" & "Tito" collections. Estimate €700.
