The change in the colors of the 3, 6,
and 9 kreuzer was made so that these
denominations would correspond to
those of the other signatories to the
German-Austrian postal union and this,
of course, necessitated the changes in
the other values to prevent confusion.
The exact dates of issue of the new
varieties is not known. All we know
is that the stamps in the new colors
were placed on sale as the stocks in
the former tints became exhausted.

The stamps were printed from the
same plates as before and in most of
them considerable variation of shade
may be found. The 6kr in ultramarine
is a rare shade worth looking for.
This completes the history of the
"numeral" stamps of Bavaria but before
dealing with the later issues it will
be as well to refer to certain varieties,
printed in black on colored paper, so
that there may be no misunderstanding
as to their status should any of our
readers come across them. We can best
do this by reprinting the following paragraph
from the Philatelic Record:

It was the custom in Bavaria to
make up the stamps for the supply of
the post-offices into packets of fifty
sheets, and these were placed in covers
of various colored paper, on which
a copy of the stamp, with the number
of sheets and stamps in the packet,
was printed in black. No order for
this is found among the official documents
relating to the earlier issues,
but the system continued in use till
the close of the numeral issues.

During the period which commenced
subsequently to the issue of the 1
kreuzer, type II, down to October,
1862, the color of the paper for the
1 kreuzer was gray, that for the 3
kreuzer was blue, that for the 6
kreuzer was brown, that for the 9
kreuzer was green, that for the 12
kreuzer was red, and that for the
18 kreuzer was yellow. The stamps
impressed on the covers had no postal
value whatever, and were simply
printed on the covers as an indication
of the particular value of the stamps
contained in them.
