# 1911 Fourteenth Issue, Prince Leopold

On March 12th, 1911, Prince Leopold
Regent of the kingdom of Bavaria, celebrated
his ninetieth birthday, and the
event was marked by the issue of a new
series of stamps bearing his portrait.
The change was something in the nature
of a revolution considering the Arms
type had been in use for a period of no
less than forty-four years. The Prince
was born at Wurzburg on March 12th,
1821, and his life and career were bound
up with the historic episodes of modern
Europe. Professionally Prince Leopold
was a soldier but when his nephew,
King Otto, succeeded to the throne in
1886 he was appointed Regent owing to
the mental deficiency of the ruler.

Prince Leopold was regarded with the
greatest affection by the people and his
birthday was observed throughout Bavaria
with the heartiest enthusiasm.
The special stamps issued to mark the
event show two designs. That for the
pfennig denominations shows a profile
bareheaded portrait, looking to left, on
a solid rectangular background. In the
upper left corner of this rectangle
figures of value are shown and in the
top right angle are the letters "Pf".
Above, on a narrow tablet of color, is
the date "12 MARZ 1911", and at the
base is the name "BAYERN" in
colored capitals. The stamps vary in
size, the lower values being smaller than
those of a higher facial value. The mark stamps are of extra large size and
show a portrait of the aged Regent looking
to right. In this instance he is
shown wearing a hat. On each side of
the portrait are ornate columns, resting
on corner rectangles of solid color, that
on the left bearing the numeral of value,
and the one on the right a letter "M".
In the centre, at the top, is the date
"rl". The portraits are strongly
drawn and are the work of the celebrated
German artist, Prof. Fritz von
Kaulbachs.

Automatically generated translation:
1911, nice assortment from 5 various issues from Prince regent Luitpold in the denomination value to 3, 5, 10, 20 and 25 penny being an attractive unperforated "proofs" on ungummed chalky paper from the 1. issue produced  Drei Löwen GmbH, EU 200, dealers price list, Dec 2015.}

The stamps are printed by
a process of photo-lithography. They
were on sale some few weeks before the
actual birthday celebration and after the
31st March all previous issues were
demonetised.

The stamps were printed on the paper
watermarked with close zig-zag lines
which has been in use since 1881. On
the values from 3pf to 25pf inclusive,
the lines are horizontal while on all
others they are vertical. In what size
sheets these stamps were printed we do
not know (possibly 100 for the pfennig
and 50 for the mark values) but it seems
probable that a new perforating machine
was brought into use. As we have already
shown the 14 l/2 and 11 1/2 machines
used from 1888 and 1881 respectively
were of the harrow kind and could,
therefore, only be used for stamps and
sheets of the size for which they were
constructed. The values from 3 to 25pf
are of the same size as the lower values
of the preceding issue and it is evident
the 14 l/2 harrow machine was used for
these; the 30pf to 80pf stamps are of
the same size as the mark stamps of the
Arms design and doubtless the old 11 1/2
harrow machine was utilised for these;
but the mark stamps were too large for
either of the existing perforating machines
and a new one, possibly a single
line machine was used. We are not
quite positive on the point as we have
only single stamps to refer to but a
single-line machine was certainly used
for the next issue in which the stamps
are of the same large size.

A 60pf value in the same design as
the others was added to the series in
October, 1911, Bavaria, in accordance
with its usual policy following Germany's
lead in the issue of new values.
The 5pf and lOpf values are known in
tete-beche pairs these being from sheets
printed for binding in book form. The
same values may also be found with advertisements
attached, these also being
from sheets intended for binding into
stamp booklets.

Most of the values
exist in several pronounced shades.
Prince Leopold died in the closing
weeks of 1912 and was succeeded as Regent
by his son, Prince Ludwig. So far
this change has had no effect on Bavaria's
postal issues though it is
rumoured that a new series is in preparation.
