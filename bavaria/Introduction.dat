\chapter{Bavaria} 



The stamps of Bavaria, although not as attractive perhaps to those of Britain or France are certainly of interest as European classics. Another advantage in collecting "Old German States" is the availability of stamps at reasonable costs. As these old German States eventually were incorporated in Germany, the number of stamps issued by each entity is limited.

Bavaria was the first of the German States to adopt adhesive postage stamps,
its pioneer labels appearing in 1849. From that date until 1876 the currency
of the kingdom was the florin of 60 kreuzer worth about 40c in United States money. In 1876 the Imperial currency of pfennige and marks was adopted.


## The First Issue

An ordinance of King Maximilian,
dated June 5th, 1849, authorised the
issue of postage stamps and fixed the
rates of postage. Local letters and printed matter were carried for 1
kreuzer, subject to certain limitations
of weight; the rate on ordinary single
letters (weighing not more than 1 loth
or %oz.) was fixed at 6kr for distances
up to 12 German miles; while 6 kreuzer
was the charge for carrying single letters
for longer distances. Postage
stamps of these values were, therefore,
prepared and, according to an elaborate
"code of instructions" dated October
25th, 1849, these were to be placed on
sale on November 1st following. The
only items we need reproduce are those
concerning the prepayment of letters
viz.

1. From the 1st November next
the prepayment of matter sent
by post in the interior of Bavaria
must be effected exclusively
by stamps, which the Postal
Administration is entitled to sell
according to Art. VII of the
Royal Ordinance of June 5th; and
for the correspondence, the marking
of the postage on the seal-side of the
letter, prescribed up till now, must
be stopped.

2. The stamps intended for the
prepayment bear the figures of the
single rates, according to the new
tariff for the interior of Bavaria, of
1 kreuzer in black, of 3 kreuzer in
blue, and of 6 kreuzer in brown-red
colors. Each stamp of the last two
kinds carries in itself a red silk
thread running from top to bottom,
as evidence of its genuineness.

## Design 

The design, common to all three
values, shows a double lined numeral,
ornamented with arabesques, within a
square frame. In the top border is
"BAYERN" (Bavaria), in. the bottom
one is "FRANCO" (Free), at the right
is "KREUZER", and at the left the
value in words "EIN", "DREI", or
"SECHS". In the small squares in the
angles the value is denoted in figures on
a checkered ground. The large central
numeral on the Ikr is on a ground of
mazework which occupies the whole of
the interior square. In the case of the
3kr and 6kr the numerals are on a circular
ground of solid color, this circle being
flattened where it meets the inner
lines of the border, thus causing the
type generally known as "broken circle."
The spandrels, or spaces in the angles,
are filled with arabesque ornamentation.
The designs were drawn by Mr. P.
Haseney, and the dies were engraved
on steel by Mr. F. J. Seitz, of Munich.
The printing plates were constructed of
separate blocks or cliches struck from
the original dies and clamped together
in a printer's chase. For the plate of
the Ikr the casts were taken in ordinary
type-metal there being ninety of these
in all, arranged in ten horizontal rows
of nine. The printing plates for the
3kr and 6kr also consisted of ninety
impressions but these were arranged in
two panes of 45 each (nine rows of
five) placed side by side. The cliches
for these values were struck in brass
at the Mint and these impressions were
soldered on to bars of iron in rows of
five. The stamps were printed by Mr.
J. G. Weiss, of Munich.



The 1kr was printed on ordinary
white wove paper, but for the other two
denominations a special greyish-white
paper was employed, in the fabric of
which red threads were introduced.
This paper, known as "Dickenson"
paper from the name of its inventor,
had the threads arranged at intervals
of 20 mm. so that one thread appeared
in each stamp. According to a writer
in the Philatelic Record for March,
1893,
