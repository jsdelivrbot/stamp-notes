\chapter{Bavaria} 



The stamps of Bavaria, although not as attractive perhaps to those of Britain or France are certainly of interest as European classics. Another advantage in collecting "Old German States" is the availability of stamps at reasonable costs. As these old German States eventually were incorporated in Germany, the number of stamps issued by each entity is limited.
