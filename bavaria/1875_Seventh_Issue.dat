# 1875 Seventh Postage Stamp Issue


Towards the close of the year 1875 a change was made in the watermark
of the paper, the crossed lines being superseded by a uniform pattern of undulating
lines (placed horizontally) set 8 1/2 mm apart. The paper was horizontally
laid but as the watermark made such a heavy impression the laid lines of the paper are frequently impossible to detect.

The same paper was used for the envelopes and wrappers which up to that time had been printed on plain paper. The same plates were used
as for printing issue five and the colors and perforation also correspond to that
series. The 1, 3, 7, 10, and 18 kreuzer values were printed on this paper and were placed on sale some time in November, 1875. They had but a short life, for on January 1st, 1876, they were withdrawn and replaced by a new series with values in Imperial currency.

Among the remainders sold in 1876
the following quantities of the stamps
of the issue under notice were included:
