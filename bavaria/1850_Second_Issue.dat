# 1850 Second Issue


In April, 1850 Bavaria joined the
German-Austrian Postal Union and as
the rate on single letters between the
states belonging to the convention had
been fixed at 9 kreuzer, arrangements
had to be made to issue a label of this
denomination. Its approaching issue
was announced by a Post-office notice,
dated 25th June, 1850, and it was actually
placed in use on July 1st, 1850.

The design of this new 9kr is very
similar to that of the 3kr and 6kr of
1849 with one important exception
the circle containing the large central
numeral is a perfect sphere and not
flattened where it touches the frame
lines.

The die was probably engraved by
Seitz and the plate was constructed by
the ordinary electrotype process. It
consisted of two panes placed side by
side. Each pane was composed of 45
casts arranged in nine rows of five,
with vertical and horizontal lines between
them, and a single line around
the whole. The plate was backed with
type metal so as to render it quite solid.
The color chosen was yellow green but
a printing was made in a pale blue
green a shade that is of considerable
rarity unused. The stamps were imperforate
and printed on the paper with
silk threads.

An official notice, dated October 1st, 1850, announced that the color of the
1 kreuzer stamp would be changed from black to rose. But not only was the
color changed but the design was altered to conform with that of the
other denominations. It was similar to that of the 9kr; the circle being complete
and not intercepted by the inner lines of the inscribed border. The
plate was made by the same process, the sheets consisted of ninety stamps
in two panes as in the case of the 9kr, and the same silk-thread paper was
used.

A new plate was also constructed for
the 6kr, this likewise having the circular
ground complete. At what date
this was brought into use is uncertain
but probably some time in 1851.
On July 19th, 1854, a Government
notice was issued intimating that a
stamp of higher value than 9kr would
be issued for the general convenience
of the public, and on August 1st following,
an 18kr stamp made its appearance.
In design, method of manufacture,
etc., this value corresponds to
those already described.

A postal convention between Bavaria
and France came into operation on
July 1st, 1858, it being mutually agreed
that the postage on a letter not exceeding
10 grammes in weight should be
12kr. A new stamp representing this
rate was placed on sale in Bavaria on
the day the new convention came into
force, the design corresponding to
that of the other values then current.

The 3kr underwent no change either
of design or color so this denomination
does not exist with completed circle.
As it was in use from 1849 until 1862
it may be found in a wide range of
shades.
