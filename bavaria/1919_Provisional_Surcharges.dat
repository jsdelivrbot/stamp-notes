# 1919 Provisional Surcharges

At the end of 1919, there was a need for three new denominations to be added to the existing definitive postage stamps. The plates of the 1 Mark denomination of the King Ludwig III definitive series were used to create three new definitive stamps in new colors, which would then be re-valued with new denominations.

The new stamps were all overprinted with "Freistaat / Bayern". The yellow green stamp was re-valued to 1.25 Mk., the orange stamp was re-valued to 1,50 Mk., and the blue stamp was re-valued to 2.50 Mk. The three re-valued stamps are shown in the scan above.

They were also issued imperforate during 1920, for sale to stamp collectors. The mint imperforate stamps are about the same price as the perforated stamps. Postally used imperforate stamps are very scarce, and the prices reflect that.
