# Republic of Bavaria, February of 1920

In February of 1920, the Republic of Bavaria began to issue their very own, unique, postage stamps. The new Bavarian stamps were inscribed merely "BAYERN"! They are all shown in the images above.

The low values of this new series featured a plowman, a sower, and an allegory of "electricity" - harnessing light to a water wheel. The lower Mark values featured a Madonna and Child. The high Mark values featured von Kaulbach's "Genius", which was the symbol of the Bavarian "Free State". The stamps were printed on papers with both the vertical and horizontal wavy lines close together watermarks.

\ph[60%]{../bavaria/1250115375.jpg}{The lower mark values, featured a Madonna and Child. These two examples also show clearly the watermark used, with vertical wavy lines close together.}

The 20 Pf. exists in two types (foot of 2 downward and foot of 2 upward). A lithographed version of the 2.50 Mark was also issued in 1920. The later, lithographed 2.50 Mk. has small, irregular background dots. The earlier, typographed 2.50 Mk. has clear, round background dots, evenly spaced in rows.

Many denominations of this set also exist imperforate, though they were not officially issued that way.

These new Bavarian stamps were relatively short-lived though. In April 1920, Bavaria became a member state within the Weimar Republic. At that time, the current Bavarian definitive and official stamps were overprinted "Deutsches Reich", for use throughout Germany, though most of the issues were used only inside of Bavaria. Since then, regular German postage stamps have been used in Bavaria.

The "Deutsches Reich" overprint set, mentioned above, contained a new high-value denomination, the 4 Mk., printed in dull red. This denomination was never issued with the original definitive set, but examples without the overprint do exist, and they aren't terribly expensive.

The "Deutsches Reich" overpint saw use well into the inflation era.
