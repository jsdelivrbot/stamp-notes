# Fifteenth Issue, 1911

In June, 1911, two stamps were issued
for use in the kingdom of Bavaria commemorative
of the twenty-fifth anniversary
of the Regency of Prince Leopold.

The portrait is somewhat similar
to that of the pfennig values of the
birthday set this being enclosed by a
large wreath held on each side by cupids.
The dates "1886-1911" are shown on the
wreath and in the lower angles are the
figures "5" or "10" to denote the value.
The name "BAYERN" is shown on a
straight tablet between the figures.

Each value is printed in three colors and they
are somewhat extraordinary productions.
The background is black, the ribbons
binding the wreath are yellow, and the
rest of the design is green for the opf
and red for the lOpf. They have a
crude cheap-looking appearance that is all the more marked on comparison
with the delicate workmanship characterising
the contemporary birthday
series.

The stamps are said to have been in
use only a limited time. They were
printed on unwatermarked paper and
perf. l1 l/2.
