# 1867-68 Fourth Issue


The adoption of a new design for the stamps of Bavaria evidently involved
much serious consideration for, though the idea was mooted in the early part of
1865 and proofs were actually existent twelve months later, it was not until
January 1st, 1867, that the stamps were really issued. The approaching change
was 'announced by means of a Government Notice dated December 14th, 1866,
the salient provisions of which were as follows :

With the Royal approval a new issue of postage stamps has been prepared,
which will be issued according to the consumption of the stock of
the existing values.

The new stamps are, like the former, printed in color on white
paper traversed by a red silk thread, and bear the Royal Arms of Bavaria,
with the two supporters in white relief on a colored ground, and with
the numeral of value in each angle. The stamps will, like the former, be
issued for the values of 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 kreuzer.

The colors of the stamps of 3, 6,
9, and 18 kreuzer are, as in the former
issue, carmine-red, blue, light brown,
and vermilion-red; the stamps of the
1 kreuzer are green in place of yellow,
and those of 12 kreuzer violet
in place of green.

The delivery of the new stamps to
the post-offices will be in sheets of
60 pieces, and in larger quantities in
packets of 50 sheets.

The design consists of the Arms of
Bavaria surmounted by a Royal crown
with lions as supporters. Under the
Arms is scroll ornamentation with
"KREUZER" in small capitals below;
while above is the name "BAYERN."

The preceding details are on a background
of solid color and of somewhat
eccentric shape. In the angles are numerals
in white on solid colored discs
to denote the various values, while the
spandrels are filled with ornamental
scrolls. In referring to the change of
design the Stamp Collectors' Magazine,
made the following interesting
comments on stamp designs in general :

The substitution of an elegant design
like this for the existing prosaic
figure, is matter for congratulation.
That a stamp may be ornamental as
well as useful, is a proposition which
most postal administrations now show
their acquiescence in. Economic reasons
are, we fear, too much in favor
of armorial bearings as a device for
stamps; but for our part, while acknowledging
the excellence of the
change from figures to arms, we must
confess we should prefer to see the
features of foreign sovereigns on a
larger number of stamps than at
present bear them. The objection to
the employment of our own Queen's
effigy on her colonial stamps, that
the frequent repetition is monotonous
and tiresome, would not hold good in
respect to continental monarchs, over
whose dominions the sun sets in the
ordinary course of nature.


## Dies and Engraving

The original or matrix die was engraved
on steel by Peter Reiss, a medal
coiner employed at the Royal Mint. The
secondary dies, on which the numerals
of value were engraved, and the brass
blocks which formed the printing plates
were also struck at the Mint.


## Plates

The plates were constructed by a process
similar to that employed for the
numeral series. Each plate consisted
of sixty brass cliches arranged in two
panes of thirty each (6 rows of 5)
placed side by side. A space about the
width of a stamp separated the panes.

The design was embossed in slight relief
on a colored ground the series being
a particularly attractive one. The
paper was similar to that used for the
preceding issues, having silk threads embedded
in its substance in such a manner
that one thread was apportioned
to each vertical row of stamps. It is
probable that the use of this paper prevented
the adoption of perforation
which, at that period, was in general
use.

There is a well-known minor variety
of the 1kr in which the numeral in the
upper right hand corner has a distinct
colored stroke across the centre.
On January 1st 1868, a new postal
arrangement was made with the North
German Confederation, Wurtemburg,
and Baden involving a postal rate of
7kr. Later this rate was extended to
include the agreements with Denmark
and Belgium and the natural outcome
was the issue of a 7 kreuzer stamp.

The issue of this new value was announced
in a Government decree dated
August 30th, 1868, and at the same time
it was decreed that the color of the
6kr would be changed to brown so as
to avoid confusion with the 7kr. These
new varieties were placed on sale on
October 1st and a month later the 9kr
was withdrawn from use and the 6kr
in the old color of blue was demonetised.
The new 7kr value was similar in design,
impression, and paper to the other
denominations of the series.

All values of this issue are said to
exist on laid paper and as such are recorded
in Scott's catalogue. M. Moens,
in a note in his catalogue observed
that "the paper is found with fine lines
resembling laid paper." It seems quite
certain that the variety is not a true
laid paper but is merely due to some
slight imperfection in manufacture.

The "laid" and "wove" varieties may
be found on the same sheet and the
former is generally considered of such
minor importance as to be hardly
worthy the attention of even an extreme
specialist. It would, therefore,
appear that the "laid" paper varieties
are hardly worthy of catalogue rank.

Most of the stamps of this issue provide
considerable variation in shade.
