Note: The so-called "Gun War" was precipitated by the Cape Government''s decision to enforce disarmament on the Basothos to Basutoland following their refusal to hand over their guns. The confrontation lasted from September 1880 until 11 April 1881 during which time the Duke of Edinburgh''s Own Volunteer Rifles were sent to relieve the besieged British stations in Basutoland

__The Gun War also known as the Basuto War was an 1880-1881 conflict in the British territory of 
Basutoland, fought between Cape Colony forces and rebellious Basotho chiefs over tribal rights.__ 

Although officially considered a stalemate, the final settlement favoured the Basotho and is thus considered a marginal defeat of the British Empire.

Basutoland�home of the Basotho people�had been under the nominal control of the Cape Colony (of the British Empire) since 1872 (it was a Crown colony 1868-1872), but the territory remained essentially autonomous in the early years of colonial rule, with traditional Basotho authorities wielding effective power. Only in the late 1870s did Cape authorities attempt to consolidate power over the region and enforce its laws. Basutholand, an independent state as recently as 1868, chafed under the new restrictions and attempts to reduce the authority of its chiefs. Matters came to a head in 1879, when Cape Town reserved part of Basutoland for white settlement and demanded that all natives surrender their firearms to Cape authorities under the 1879 Peace Protection Act.

Within months of the pronouncement, most Basotho chiefs were in open rebellion. 
Colonial Cape forces sent to put down the rebellion suffered heavy casualties, as the Basotho had obtained 
serviceable firearms from the Orange Free State and enjoyed a natural defensive advantage in their country's 
mountainous terrain. The rebels relied primarily on guerrilla warfare, 
ambushing isolated units to negate the British/Cape superiority in firepower.

In October, Basotho forces ambushed a mounted column of British Army lancers at Qalabani (present-day Lancers Gap, near Maseru), killing 39. The defeat of an experienced and well-armed cavalry column discouraged Cape authorities. A peace treaty was signed with Basotho chiefs in 1881, in which colonial authorities conceded most of the points in dispute. The land remained in Basotho hands and the nation enjoyed unrestricted access to firearms in exchange for a national one-time indemnity of 5000 cattle. However, unrest continued and it quickly became clear that Cape Town could not control the territory. In 1884, the British government returned Basutoland to Crown colony status, granting internal self-government in the process. With effective power once again firmly with the chiefs, the conflict subsided.
