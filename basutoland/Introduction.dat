\subsection{Officials}
The official overprint stamps were issued in 1934. There are four values, \frac12d., 1d., 2d., and 6d. They are
amongst the rarest stamps of the British Commonwealth. At a time it was thought that no unused stamps could be
found {{footnote:1}}. The used quantities are believed to be very low, 1/2d-23,1d.-34,2d.-54 and 6d.-26. \footnote{testings}\footnote{other}\footnote{more}
