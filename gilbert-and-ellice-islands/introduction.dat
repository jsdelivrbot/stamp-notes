\chapter{Postage stamps and postal history of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands}


The first mail service to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands was ad hoc, 
depending on which ships were calling at the various islands. 
A regular service began in 1911; 
Edward VII postage stamps of Fiji were 
overprinted GILBERT \& ELLICE / PROTECTORATE and 
put on sale on 1 January of that year, followed 
in March by a set of four stamps depicting a Pandanus tree, 
inscribed GILBERT \& ELLICE ISLANDS / PROTECTORATE.
\section{George V}

These were followed in 1912 by George V stamps of the 
common type, inscribed GILBERT \& ELLICE ISLANDS. 
A new definitive series came out starting 
14 January 1939, featuring local scenery and a 
profile of George VI. These were updated in 1956 with a profile of Elizabeth II.

\section{Queen Elizabeth II}

A set of four stamps on 1 May 1960 commemorated the 
60th anniversary of the discovery of phosphate at Ocean Island. 
The definitive series of 1965 depicted daily activities of the natives, 
but a decimal currency conversion necessitated surcharges in 1966 
and a reissue of the stamps in 1968. The colony issued about 10-15 
stamps per year thereafter, usually as sets of four, until the end of 1975.

In 1976, the islands became two separate colonies and later independent 
as Kiribati and Tuvalu.
