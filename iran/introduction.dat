# Introduction to the Postal History and Stamps of  Iran

## Indian postal agencies

In 1864 British colonial post offices using Indiaâ€™s postage stamps were opened in [Muscat](../muscat/introduction) and [Bushire](../bushire/Introduction). These two postal outlets proved very successful and in 1867, Anglo-Indian post offices were opened in Bandar Abbas, and Linga. In the course of time a total of 13 Indian Post Offices operated in Iran. Following a 1922 agreement between India and Iran, on 30 March 1923 all Indian postal facilities in Iran were closed, except for two exchange bureaux in Duzdab and Mirjawa that continued to function for a few more years.

## Revolution

The 1979 overthrow of the Shah that ended up with Iran being declared an Islamic Republic, provided a total change to the stamp issuing policies. From glamorous subjects to clergy.
