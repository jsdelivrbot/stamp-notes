# Introduction to the Postal History and Stamps of  Iran


‭


Persia is a word largely used by Europeans and derives from Persis. the Persians call their country Iran and themselves Iranians, and hence in the articles here we have used Iran rather than Persia.

Iran philately reflects its history, and has diverse subjects, from ealy Europeans reaching it, to the Islamic Republic of the Ayatollahs.

The stamps and covers are described chronologically with minor exceptions. Language difficulties precluded us to provide a detailed study of postmarks, but with a few exceptions such as the censoring of Shah Ahmed's stamps on the ascent of the first Pahlavi, Monarch.

## Indian postal agencies

In 1864 British colonial post offices using India’s postage stamps were opened in [Muscat](../muscat/introduction) and [Bushire](../bushire/Introduction). These two postal outlets proved very successful and in 1867, Anglo-Indian post offices were opened in Bandar Abbas, and Linga. In the course of time a total of 13 Indian Post Offices operated in Iran. Following a 1922 agreement between India and Iran, on 30 March 1923 all Indian postal facilities in Iran were closed, except for two exchange bureaux in Duzdab and Mirjawa that continued to function for a few more years. The [Indian Postal Agencies](Indian_Postal_Agencies) article, provides numerous examples and a more detailed history.

## The First Stamps

The [first stamps](../iran/ersia_1848-1896_Nasserr-eddin_Shah_Qajar) were issued during the reign of Nasserr-eddin Shah Qajar. They are difficult stamps to sort and study with numerous printings, reprints and forgeries.

on the  1st of  September  1877 during Nasser-eddin Sha Qajar's rule Iran joined the UPU.

## The Pahlavi Dynasty

In 1925 Reza Shah Pahlavi took over the power by deposing Shah Ahmad. The Pahlavi's were to stay on the  throne until overthrown in 1979. During their rule Iran was modernized and many improvements to communications and the posts occured, including the introduction of air mail services in 1925.

## 1979 Revolution

The 1979 overthrow of the Shah that ended up with Iran being declared an Islamic Republic, provided a total change to the stamp issuing policies. From glamorous subjects to clergy.

## Collecting and Buying of Iranian Stamps      

Currently 2015 it appears that as far as Iranian stamps are concerned it is a buyer's market (especially from auctions in the USA). The current population of Iran is estimated at 77.45 million and there are also about 5 million living abroad, which are probably the main pool of current Iranian philatelists.
