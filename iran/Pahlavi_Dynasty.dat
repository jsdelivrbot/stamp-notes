# The beginnings of the Pahlavi Dynasty

Reza Shah Pahlavi (Persian: رضا شاه پهلوی; pronounced [reˈzɑː ˈʃɑːhe pæhlæˈviː]) (15 March 1878 – 26 July 1944), was the Shah of Iran (Persia) from 15 December 1925 until he was forced to abdicate by the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran on 16 September 1941.[3]


Four years after a British-assisted coup, the 1921 Persian coup d'état, in 1925 Rezā Shāh deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar, the last Shah of the Qajar dynasty, and founded the Pahlavi dynasty. He established a constitutional monarchy that lasted until overthrown in 1979 during the Iranian Revolution. Reza Shah introduced many social, economic, and political reforms during his reign, ultimately laying the foundation of the modern Iranian state.
His legacy remains controversial to this day: his defenders assert that he was an essential modernizing force for Iran (whose international prominence had sharply declined during Qajar rule), while his detractors assert that his reign was often despotic, with his failure to modernize Iran's large peasant population eventually sowing the seeds for the Iranian Revolution.[4][5] Moreover, his insistence on ethnic nationalism and cultural unitarism along with forced detribalization and sedentarization resulted in suppression of several ethnic and social groups

## Covers with covered up frankings of Ahmad Shah Qajar

With the overthrow of Ahmad Shah Qajar, the Postal Authorities could not demonetize the stamps with his portrait immediately, so they either covered them up and postamrked them or used a heavy obliterator.
