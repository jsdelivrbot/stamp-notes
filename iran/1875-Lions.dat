# The Lion issue of 1875

 		
In order to improve and reorganize the existing postal system, Nasser-Eddin Shah appointed Herr Gustave Riederer, a senior Official of the Austrian Post as Director of Posts of Iran. On his arrival in Iran in November 1874 he ordered a new set of stamps to be prepared based on the old clichés and in accordance with the UPU regulations. To make the stamps intelligible universally, new Arabic numerals had been added individually by engraving underneath the lions. Due to this "individual engraving", four different types could be classified as follows.

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
Nomination	&Types	&Corresponding Barre Clichés	&Quantity Printed\\
1 Shahi	    &A - B - C - D	&3 - 4 - 5 - 2	&40000\\
2 Shahis	&A - B - C - D	&5 - 4 - 3 - 1	&30000\\
4 Shahis	&A - B - C - D	&2 - 5 - 1 - 3	&30000\\
8 Shahis	&A - B - C - D	&1 - 4 - 2 - 5	&20000\\
\end{tabular}

The stamps were printed in horizontal sheetlets of four stamps in several settings and different paper in several color shades, so they are quite complex to collect and identify.
