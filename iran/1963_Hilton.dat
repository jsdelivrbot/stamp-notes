The hotel originally consisted of a single tower containing 259 rooms. An additional tower, with 291 more rooms, was constructed in 1972. The hotel's famous guests during this period included Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, King Hussein of [Jordan](../jordan/Introduction), and astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.


The hotel was renamed the Esteghlal Hotel (meaning "Independence" Hotel in Persian) following the Islamic Revolution in 1979, when all foreign hotel management contracts were severed. It is today part of the state-run Parsian International Hotels Co. A third tower is currently under construction.
