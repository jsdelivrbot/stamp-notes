## Hawaii - The Missionaries
The Hawaiian Missionaries are the first postage stamps of the Kingdom of Hawaii, 
issued in 1851. They came to be known as the "Missionaries" 
because they were primarily found on the correspondence of missionaries 
working in the Hawaiian Islands. Only a handful of these stamps have survived 
to the present day, and so they are amongst the great rarities of philately.

The stamps shown here do not belong to my collection, but they are scans from various sales. If you own one, be proud and send
us your own scan and story and I will give you full credit.
Background

In the early 19th century, mail to and from Hawaii was carried by ship captains on an ad hoc basis. By 1849, partly as a side effect of the California Gold Rush and the settlement of California, mail to and from San Francisco had increased greatly. In response, the Hawaiian government established a post office and set postal rates. Henry M. Whitney, the first postmaster, was authorized to print stamps for those rates in June 1851, which he did using the printing press of The Polynesian, a weekly government newspaper.
###The Two Cents Hawaii Missionary Stamp


\ph[50%]{../hawaii/4001.jpg}{
1851, 2c Blue (1). Type II, a superb-appearing example with rich color and impression, large margins on all sides showing portions of framelines from adjoining stamps at left (space between two cliches) and right (gutter between impressions), cancelled by large circular grid of squares (Type 6). With respect to condition, we quote Herbert A. Bloch's description of this stamp in the 1957 Caspary sale: "A piece at top, which was torn off when the stamp was found, has been replaced in its original position without any repair in the philatelic sense of the word. Despite this fault a magnificent copy of this classic world rarity..."
EXTREMELY FINE APPEARANCE. ONE OF THE FINEST-APPEARING EXAMPLES OF THE 1851 2-CENT MISSIONARY. ONLY FIFTEEN EXAMPLES OF THIS WORLD-RENOWNED RARITY ARE RECORDED, OF WHICH TEN ARE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE MUSEUMS
The fifteen examples of the 2c Missionary in our census (see catalogue for Honolulu Advertiser sale, Siegel Sale 769, Appendix I) include five stamps now held by museums and only two sound copies, one of which is unused. Both sound stamps were offered in the Honolulu Advertiser sale, and the used copy was acquired by the National Postal Museum. The stamp offered here has the widest margins of any recorded 2c Missionary and is essentially intact, without any paper restoration or painting in of the design. The light cancel and large margins all around make it one of the most beautiful 2c Missionary stamps extant and certainly one of the finest used copies available to collectors, all of which have faults or repairs to a degree.
This 2c Missionary was in an old leather notebook brought to Ezra Cole in New York City, circa 1935. 
His account of the discovery states: 
This stamp was found by a lawyer friend of my father's in Brooklyn. 
It was in a small old red leather notebook. There were several other inexpensive stamps with it and this 2c Missionary was actually in two pieces...I took the notebook and the stamp up to my friend, Percy Doane, 
in the Tribune Building and inquired as to the genuineness of the stamp for 
I had never seen one. He told me that it was genuine and valuable and it could be 
sold even in its present condition. At some time later on, I sold it to Burger Brothers for $4,500.
 They, in turn, sold it to A. H. Caspary. I never did learn how much Caspary paid for it."
 In the Caspary sale, the stamp realized $5,250. It was subsequently acquired by Alfred J. Ostheimer III, whose collection helped form the basis of the Honolulu Advertiser collection.

1851, 2c Blue (1). Type I, deep shade, large margins to just in, cancelled by clearly-struck Crossed-Bars cancel (Type 72 without circle), affixed to small card to preserve paper, repaired at top left and bottom left adding small portions of the frame lines and design

A FINE-APPEARING EXAMPLE OF THE LEGENDARY HAWAIIAN 1851 2-CENT MISSIONARY, ONE OF PHILATELY'S RAREST STAMPS. THIS 2-CENT MISSIONARY IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE FIFTEEN KNOWN EXAMPLES BEARING THE RARE CROSSED-BARS CANCEL.

Fifteen 2c Missionary stamps are recorded, including the unique unused stamp and the unique cover. Of the thirteen used copies, five are in museums, leaving eight used off-cover stamps available to collectors (including one on piece). None of the eight available used copies is entirely sound. This example, with its relatively minor repairs, is one of the finer-appearing examples of this rare stamp. It is the only 2c Missionary with the Crossed Bars cancel, which is also known on three 5c and two 13c (Scott 3) Missionaries.

<strong>This 2c Missionary is first recorded as having been owned by dealer William P. Brown, 
who sold it to Count Philippe de la Renotiere von Ferrary in 1872 for $25. 
At the fourth Ferrary sale in 1922 the stamp was purchased by Arthur Hind 
for the equivalent of $8,750. Hind also acquired the unique British Guiana 1c 
Magenta stamp at the Ferrary sales. After passing to Admiral Harris and Maurice Burrus, 
this stamp was acquired by Thurston Twigg-Smith, who sold it privately to Christian Aall, 
then bought it back when the Aall collection was sold by the Siegel firm in 1998 (Sale 805).</strong>

###The Five Cents Hawaiian Missionary Stamp


\ph[50%]{../hawaii/4003.jpg}{


1851, 5c Blue (2). Type II with the distinctive small "n" in "Cents" (found only on the 5c Type II), perfect bold jet-black strike of Crossed Bars cancel (Type 71 with circle), appears to have four large even margins, expertly repaired at right with small piece of paper added and portion of design painted in

EXTREMELY FINE APPEARANCE. ONLY THREE OF THE 40 RECORDED USED EXAMPLES OF THE HAWAIIAN 1851 5-CENT MISSIONARY HAVE THE RARE CROSSED BARS CANCELLATION.

The Crossed Bars cancel is found with and without the surrounding circle on one 2c, three 5c and two 13c (Scott 3) Missionaries. One additional cancelled stamp has been added to our census published in the Honolulu Advertiser sale, bringing the total number of 5c Missionaries to 62 (including 40 used off cover or on piece).

1851, 5c Blue (2). Type II, clear to ample margins with framelines complete all around, rich color, bold 7-bar grid cancel (Type 7), short sealed tear at bottom, the stamp is otherwise free of faults and has not been repaired in any sense of the word

EXCEPTIONALLY FINE CONDITION FOR A HAWAIIAN MISSIONARY STAMP AND A CHOICE EXAMPLE OF THE 5-CENT TYPE II SHOWING THE SMALL-SIZE "N" IN "CENTS"

Of the 62 5c Missionaries recorded in our updated census (see Honolulu Advertiser catalogue, Siegel Sale 769, Appendix I), only thirteen off-cover stamps are available to collectors without repairs or serious defects, including ten used examples. This stamp shows the distinctive small "n" in "Cents", a font characteristic of all genuine Type II 5c Missionary stamps, which indicates this value was the first setting of the Missionary printings (the other values show the "n" in the correct size).

1851, 13c Blue (3). Type I, neatly cancelled by red "(Honolulu Hawaiia)n-Isla(nds)" circular datestamp (Type 236.11) along left side leaving numeral and labels completely unobscured, appears to have full margins although the stamp has been skillfully repaired with portions of framelines painted in, sealed tear and slight toning

VERY FINE APPEARANCE. ONE OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE EXAMPLES OF THE 1851 13-CENT "HAWAIIAN POSTAGE" MISSIONARY BY VIRTUE OF THE NEAT RED HONOLULU DATESTAMP CANCELLATION.

Our updated census of 13c "Hawaiian Postage" Missionaries (Scott 3) contains a total of 72 examples on or off cover. There are now 53 cancelled off-cover stamps, including the two genuine stamps from the Grinnell family's "Card of 10." Ten examples of Scott 3 are cancelled by the red Honolulu datestamp ("Hawaiian-Islands" or "U.S. Postage Paid").

###13c Blue H.I. & U.S. Postage

\ph[50%]{../hawaii/4007.jpg}{


1852, 13c Blue, "H.I. & U.S. Postage" (4). Type I, huge top and bottom margins, ample at right and about half of frameline clear at left, rich color and clear impression showing slight "kiss" print at upper left corner, bold 7-bar grid cancel (Type 7), completely sound

VERY FINE AND THE FINER OF THE TWO RECORDED SOUND USED 1852 13-CENT "H.I. & U.S. POSTAGE" MISSIONARY STAMPS OFF COVER

There are 52 examples of the 13c "H.I. & U.S. Postage" Missionary in our updated census (see Honolulu Advertiser catalogue, Siegel Sale 769, Appendix I). Only 35 used stamps are recorded off cover or on piece, and about two-thirds of these are repaired or in museum collections. Of those unrepaired copies that remain in private hands, only two sound examples are recorded: the stamp offered here and the cut-in, slightly toned example, ex Potts, Moody and Krug (Census No. 4-II-CAN-176). Thus, for the collector of sound used classics, this is a rarity among rarities.
