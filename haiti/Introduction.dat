\chapter{Postage stamps and postal history of Haiti}

\lettrine{H}{aiti's philatelic history} is inextricably related to its
political history.
Located in the Caribbean it occupies the western part of the island of Hispaniola which it shares with the Dominican Republic. The capital is Port-au-Prince.\footnote{Port-au-Prince is located in the South.}

Haiti joined the UPU and issued its first stamps on 1 July 1881, the classic issue
of the so called Liberty Head issues. The issue has been extensively studied
by philatelists.


\section{First stamps}

The first stamp of Haiti was issued in 1881 in the 1c value and showed the head of Liberty.

At the time of the Liberty Hea stamps were issued in 1881, Salomon was in
the second year of his seven-year term as President. Although it was suggested to him
that the effigy of one of Haiti's early heroes should apear on its first stamps, he purportetly said to his advisors `Here, gentlemen, I cannot help telling
you that I do not concur. I should not consent to have my portrait on the stamps
nor those of my predecessors, for if they were portrayed, public opinion would claim me as well'. He was neiter truthful nor modest. \footnote{See Melville.}

Like almost all and subsequent leaders of Haiti, Salomon gradually fell from from 
favour as his presidency progressed.

One of the criticisms that Salmon faced from his opponents was that the stamp depicting the liberty resembled that of his wife. As the plates were worn and the first stamp
was of poor quality Salomon acquiscent to have his image on the next issue.
