\chapter{Liberty Head}    

Besides the colour trials of the values actually issued, there are essays
of similar design but larger in size—24x29 mm. instead of 18x22 mm. I
have seen the 2 c. in bright blue and 20 c. in black, bright blue, and pale
lake, and another value which was not issued—the 9 c. There is in the
collection a proof in black from the die, having the value-shield blank and
an extra blank lower label below the one containing the shield and the word
" CENT." The lettering of this proof is different from that of the issued
stamps, and the word " TIMBRE " instead of " POSTE " is on either side of the
shield in the circle surrounding the head ; while above the head are the
words " REPUB. D'HAITI" instead of " REPUBLIQUE D'HAITI."

Various theories have been put forward as to the method of production
of the " Liberty-Head" stamps of Hayti. At first they were thought to
have been lithographed, but any specimen, when closely examined, points to
another process having been employed. There is none of that smooth
appearance which is essential to a lithograph, and in many cases the paper is
very deeply dented by the figure of value. In Le Timbre Paste of May and
July, 1899, M. Moens gives some interesting data with regard to the
production of these stamps. A Haytian sculptor (M. Laforesterie) is said
to have designed them, and a die was engraved on wood by M. J. Richard, of
Paris. The plates were made up of electrotypes. The shield which contains
the figure of value in the completed design was at first left blank. It is
stated by M. Moens that these shields were filled up by movable plugs, thus
indicating that there was only one plate, and that the plugs were altered for
each value. This theory I am afraid I do not agree with. In every one of
the fifty stamps on the plate of each value the position of the figure of value
varies, and the edges of the plug in the shield are more or less defined by
lines of colour. But taking a stamp of any one value in any particular position
on the plate, it will" be found that in all copies of that stamp the figure in
the shield is always in exactly the same position. This shows that if the
plugs were altered for printing each value, and only one plate was used, the
whole number printed of each value must have been done in one printing.
This is hardly likely, and a study of the stamps will, I think, show that it was
not the method employed. Supposing the i c. were all printed first and the
20 c. last, it would mean that the i c. would be only from the early state of
the plate and the 20 c. from the last, but this is not the case. It is possible
to find both these and all the other values in early and late states. There is
another point against the use of one plate only, and that is that in each
value it is possible to find flaws and defects in the design itself, apart from
the shield, which are peculiar to each value. My idea is that a separate
plate was made for each value from the original plate with vacant spaces in
the shield for the value plugs. Some of the values exist in such different
shades that there must have been more than one printing of these values.


The next point to be considered is the number of panes on the sheet.
M. Moens says that there were six panes of fifty arranged in three rows of
two panes. Before the stamps were printed the paper received a lithographic
impression in colour. It will be seen that on the margins of the panes there
are certain more or less circular marks which were on the extreme edge of
the coloured impression. These will help us to decide how many panes there
were on each sheet of paper. At present it is possible to say that there were
at least four, as in the collection you will see two panes tete-beche of the
one centime, and there are others with the circular marks on the margins
which show that there were at least two more different panes.
As a matter of fact, the probabilities seem more in favour of the sheet
containing four panes instead of six, as the numbers given for the printings
of each value are divisible by two hundred but not by three hundred. In
any case, if the sheet contained six panes of fifty, it would be more likely
that there were two rows of three panes instead of three rows of two panes, as
all the so-called tete-beche pairs and sheets have the lower parts of the stamps
towards each other.

The numbers printed were :—

1 c., 300,000 .5 c., 150,000
2 c, 150,000 7 c., 250,000
3 c., 150,000 20 c., 25,000


According to these figures one would expect the 20 c. to be by far the
scarcest value, and this is borne out by experience. The 5 c. is very nearly
as rare as the 20 c. in unused condition, but very much more common used.
One would expect the 7 c. to be a good deal commoner than the 2 c. and 3 c.,
but this is not the case.

The 1c. and 2c. are known tete-beche owing to the panes of fifty being
printed tete-beche. The other values should also be found in the same condition.


It has been stated that the perforated stamps, the first of which appeared
towards the end of 1882, perforated by a single-line machine 13^, were printed
from the same plates as the imperforate series; I must say, however, that I
entirely disagr.ee with this theory. You will see in the collection that the
plates of the perforated series are almost complete, and the reconstruction of
the plates has led me to this conclusion. To give only one instance: In
every value of the imperforate series No. 38, that is to say, the eighth stamp
in the fourth row, has a defective " Q " in " REPUBLIQUE "—there is a piece of
the oval of the " Q " missing on the lower left-hand side. This is a variety
that can be very easily recognized, and it is never found perforated.
From the reconstructed sheets it is evident that for the perforated series
there were three distinct sets of plates. I say distinct, because in every plate
belonging to a particular set there are flaws which are peculiar to that set.
This at first caused a good deal of trouble. Most of the plating of the
perforated series was done from a complete pane of the one centime. I
would find, for instance, the position on the pane of a specimen of the seven
centimes ultramarine, and then I would find that there was a seven centimes
blue which was evidently the same variety, but the position of the " 7 " in the
shield was different, and there were differences also in the other parts of the
stamp.
Fortunately there is no difficulty in deciding to which plate any specimen
belongs. So far, I have always found that any one shade or colour belongs
to a particular plate. For instance, there are three distinct shades of the
5 c.: a bluish green, which is always found to belong to what is called in
these notes, Plate I, a yellow-green which is.always Plate II, and a deep
bright green, which is always Plate III. There are of course shades of each,
but it is always quite easy to say to which plate any specimen belongs.
The 5 c. is the only value which was printed from all three plates, and the
plates are named in the order of the dates in which the printings of the 5 c.
appeared.
The chief peculiarities of the plates are as follows:—
Plates I and II.

\begin{description}
\item [No. 25.] There is a slanting stroke across the space between the outer lines
of the frame above the " Q" of " R&PUBLIQUE."

\item [No. 28.] There is a coloured lump on the bottom of the " C " of " CENT "
in the left lower label.

\item [No. 40.] There is a lump on the outer right-hand side of the shield
opposite the upper part of the " C " of " CENT."

\item [No. 43.] (Except the 3 c.) There is a thin white mark across the lower
part of the neck.

\end{description}

Plate II.

No. 32. The lower left-hand corner of the shield is incomplete.
Plate III.
No. 3. The upright part of the " L " of " R^PUBLIQUE " is broken.
No. 17. The outer frame at the lower left corner is damaged.
No. 27. The outer frame at the upper left corner is badly damaged

The following is a list of the values and their respective colours printed
from each of the three plates :—
Plate I.
1 c., deep vermilion on deep buff, carmine on pale buff.
2 c., deep violet on mauve, violet on mauve.
3 c., yellow-bistre on deep buff, grey-bistre on pale buff.
5 c., blue-green on pale greenish.
7 c., deep blue on greyish, dull blue on greyish.
Plate la.
2 c., purple on very pale mauve almost white.*
Plate II.
1 c., pale vermilion on pale buff.
3 c., olive-bistre on pale buff. *
5 c., yellow-green on greenish.
7 c., ultramarine on greyish.
20 c., red-brown on buff
Plate III.
2 c., aniline mauve on very pale mauve.
5 c., deep bright green on greenish.
20 c., pale brown on buff.
* Plate la. has so far been only found in the two centime value. The stamps belonging to this are
brighter in colour and on nearly white paper, while those belonging to Plate I are duller and on paper
deeply tinted dull mauve. The chief differences lie in the positions of the figures. There seems to be
still another plate in the same shade as la.

WHILE the plates of the imperforate series appear to be
made up of fifty different electros, those of the perforated
stamps seem to consist of two panes of twentyfive.
That is to say, there are a great many points of
similarity between the corresponding stamps on the
two panes, although the value plugs seem to have been
inserted separately for'every stamp in the sheet of fifty.

This is an important difference between the plates used for the imperforate
and perforated stamps. It has been said that, like the imperforate
series, there were six panes of fifty in the sheet. At present there does not
seem to be any evidence to support this theory, and up to now no tete-beche
pairs of any perforated stamp have been heard of.
It has also been said that certain of the values were printed on white
paper, but although in some cases the paper does appear to be only slightly
tinted, it is hardly correct to call it white.
You may have noticed in some catalogues there is a 2 c. aniline mauve
stamp placed by itself under date 1883, a^ the other perforated varieties
being classed under 1882 (with the exception of the re-drawn types). This
is quite incorrect, as the earliest specimen of this shade known so far is
dated 1885. There are several varieties given in the earlier list which did
not appear till later than this 2 c. aniline mauve.
The following varieties of perforation have been seen :—
The i c., Plate I, is known imperforate horizontalJy.
The i c., Plate, II is known in a pair imperforate between both horizontally
and vertically.
The 2 c., Plate la, is known jn a pair imperforate between vertically.
The 2 c., Plate III „ imperforate and in pairs imperforate between
both horizontally and vertically.
The 3 c., Plate II „ in a pair imperforate between vertically.
The 5 a, Plate III „
The 7 c., Plate II
The 20 c., Plate II „ imperforate and in pairs imperforate between
both horizontally and vertically.

M. Moens gives the numbers sent out to Hayti in 1883 of the perforated
series as follows :—

1 c., 206,000. 5 c., 157,000.
2 c., 105,000. 7 c., 71,000.
3 c., 70,000. 20 c., 33,000.

As in the case of the imperforate series, some of these figures are not
divisible by three hundred, which is an argument, not perhaps of much
value, against the sheets consisting of six panes of fifty.
At present it has not been possible to obtain records of any other consignments,
though it is almost certain that there must have been more.
The Philatelic Record fat October, 1882 (Vol. IV., p. 157) mentions the 5 c.
and 7 c. perforated, and in the following month Le Timbre Paste gives the
3 c. and in April and July, 1884, the i c., 2 c., and 20 c. I have endeavoured
to fix as far as possible the dates of issue of the different values by means of
dated copies, but so far I have not been able to find a copy of the 7 c.
perforated earlier than the 22nd December, 1885, in the ultramarine colour ;
while the 7 c. imperf. is found in continuous use up to September, 1885, so
In Stanley Gibbons' Monthly Journal (Vol. X., p. 65), two lists are given
for the perforated stamps, in addition to the series printed from the new diesone
under date 1882 to 1884, and the other 1883. The latter are distinguished
by the less oily appearance of the paper. I must say I can find no
justification for this subdivision, and some of the varieties given in the
second list are certainly of earlier date than others in the first list.
Owing no doubt to the fact that the plates of the i c., 2 c., and 5 c. were
too much worn in 1886 to be of any further use, new plates were made
from fresh dies. For the two lower values the same die was employed, but
the plates were made on a different principle from before, as the figure of
value seems to have been inserted in the die itself, and not separately in each
one of the fifty impressions in the plate. The consequence is that the
numeral of value is always the same, and in the same position ; and there
are no marks in the shield where the plug was inserted, as in the earlier
printings. The most noticeable difference from the earlier issues is in the
shading on the face, which now has vertical as well as horizontal lines.
The earliest known copy of the new design is chronicled in the Monthly
Journal for September 30,1899, on page 67—a 2 c. dated March, 1886. The
plate for the 5 c., which was not made from the same die, was evidently not
wanted till later, as the earliest specimen known so far is dated I5th April,
1887. The die used might be the first one re-engraved. The figure of value
is very much larger than before, but the lettering and design are much the
same as those of the early one. The perforation was the same as before for
all values—13^, and the papers were tinted, yellow for the i c., pale lilac for
the 2 c., and pale greenish for the 5 c. According to the Monthly Journal,
the following numbers, approximately, were printed of each :—

\begin{verbatim}
1 c., 310,000.
2 c., 180,000.
5 c., 75,000.
\end{verbatim}

I have endeavoured by means of dated copies to find out the length of
time the supplies of imperforate stamps of all the values lasted, and when
the various printings of the perforated began to be used. This is set out in
a table which, I think, will help to explain why some values appear in the
perforated state so much later than others.

The 7 c. is the most remarkable. The imperforate variety is found in
constant use till September, 1885, by which date both the shades of the
perforated stamp—the 7 c., blue, from Plate I, and the 7 c., ultramarine, from
Plate II—had arrived; and the consequence was that both shades were in
use at the same time.

It will be seen that while the stock of the 7 c. lasted till 1890, and of the
20 c. to 1895, those of the I c., 2 c., 3 c., and 5 c. were exhausted in 1887;
and this explains the necessity for a new supply of these values, but they
were of a different type, with the head of President Salomon.


that although perforated copies may have been seen as early, as October,
1882, there is little doubt that there were plenty of the imperforate variety
in stock, and they lasted for three years longer.


I had hoped to have been able to give you full details about the forgeries
of the
the " Liberty Head " type, but up to now the inquiries which have been
made have not borne fruit. It may be of interest to mention the values that
are known and a few other particulars. In the \textit{Monthly Journal}, Vol. X,
pp. 67, 68, is given a translation of a letter from M. Mahe on the subject of
the perforated forgeries, which do not appear to have been made to deceive
collectors, but to defraud the Post Office. There are many differences both
in the design and the lettering. The forgeries are lithographed and perforated
both 14 and 16, while the originals are typographed and perforated
13\half. All the forgeries are the same type, and the position of the figure indicating
the value does not vary.
The lists given in the Monthly Journal are as follows :—

\begin{verbatim}
Perforated 16. 1 c., 2 c., 3 c., 5 c., 7 c., 20 c.
Perforated 14. 2 c., 3 c., 5 c., 7 c., 20 c.
\end{verbatim}

Of these so far I have not seen the 5 c. perforated 16, or the 3 c. and
20 c. perforated 14.
It may be of use to give a list of dated copies known up to the present
