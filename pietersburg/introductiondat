With the departure of President __Oom Paul Kruger__ after the British Forces entered Pretoria and ultimate
exile, Stae Secretary F.W.Reitz took a series of steps through barious notices and proclamations leading to the appointment
of the Dutch language newspaper, _De Zoutpansberg Wachter_, as security printers for the state.

The stamps were supplied to the post offices in sheets of 24.

PIETERSBURG 1901 composite essay sheetlet for all six duties, only the 4d format was used as a base for the all the final designs. Printed in deep blue on thin gummed wove paper. Signed ‘J Heijstek’ and date-stamped ‘6 JANUARI 1901.’ Edge tear at left and 
vertical crease not affecting the impressions. 
Very rare, with less than nine believed to exist.
</p>
</div>

Essays, one for each value, were produced in blue ink as illustrated above. At least 9 such strips are believed to
have survived. Some have been endorsed by the landdrost of Zoutpansberg, __J.Heijstek__, as being tru proof copies.
From these the one depicting __FOUR PENCE__ was selected for the final design.

Before describing the issue it maybe instructive to examine the printing process in order to form an
appreciation for the many varities that occur in the issue. Each cliche would have been composed of at leats 73 individual
pieces of type and spring brass strips, assembled so that the denominators together with the words __PENNY__,
__PENCE__, or __SHILLING__ could be altered at will. Individual cliches had to be then placed into wooden frames,
with wooden spacer strips, which could then be wedged and clamped into a single forme.

Mathews notes that while the printing took place the normal functions of _De Zoutpansberg Wachter__ carried out while the stamps were
prepared.

In the 15 March 1901 Issue the following notice was published in the Government Gazette:

<blockquote>
With reference to the new postage stamps which the Government of the South African Republic has decided to issue,
it is hereby notified for general information that the issue of postage stamps of the value of One Penny will
take place on March 20th, 1901. The Postage Stamps will be obtainable at all Post Offices. J.T.De.V.Smit, Controller.
</blockquote>

While some other duties might have been printed by that time, their issue was delayed - almost certainly by the time consuming
processes of signing and perforating.

###One Penny

The issue can be found both imperforate as well as perforate and both signed as well as unsigned.

Gibbons only lists two printings but in fact most authorities accept that there maybe more than two
runs.

Without recourse to the original sheets of the first printing this is difficult.

###Two Pence

Three distinct settings are now believed to have been made. Mathews notes that at least 13 runs were made, but
it does not follow that adjustments were made between each print run. The Two Pence was probably printed
after the four pence, since errors exist with the 4 in corners, probably left on the cliche from the previous
run.

This was the last duty printed. many have calaimed that only one printing took place. Like the 2d
it has an appearance that the cliches were thoroughly cleaned before printing. This is emphasized by the yellow background
of the paper colour.

Mathews astutely notes that the first indication of a second printing came in late 1981.

Although the numbers printed and issued were low, probably due to the then high face value, a fair percentage of the 1 shilling stamps has survived.
Full sheets and large blocks, however, are seldom seen - even unsigned.


###Unsigned Remainders
<hr/>
{{warning: These obviously have no standing as postage stamps, as without the signature they were invalid to be used for postage.
However, in multiples or in sheets their evidence is invaluable for research. As ordered quantities of some duties
must have been exceeded quite considerably notaby for the 2d, 4d and 6d, full advantage may be taken of this rather
unusual opportunity.}}
