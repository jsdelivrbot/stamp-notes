The United States Exploring Expedition was an exploring and surveying expedition of the Pacific Ocean ("the Southern Seas") conducted by the United States Navy from 1838--1842. The original appointed commanding officer was Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones. The voyage, was authorized by Congress in 1836. It is sometimes called the "Ex. Ex." for short, or "the Wilkes Expedition" in honor of its next appointed commanding officer, U.S. Navy Lt. Charles Wilkes (1798--1877). 

The expedition was of major importance to the growth of science in the United States.



\subsection{Preparations}

In May, 1828, the United States Congress, after prodding by President John Quincy Adams, 
voted to send an expedition around the world, it was with the understanding that the country would derive great benefit. It was to promote commerce and to offer protection to the heavy investment in the whaling and seal hunting industries, chiefly in the Pacific Ocean. Congress also agreed that a public ship or ships should be used. At the time, the only ships owned by the government capable of such a circumnavigation were those of the U.S. Navy. So, in fact, Congress had decided that a naval expedition be authorized. There were to be many unforeseen impediments and it was not until May 18, 1836, that an act was passed, which authorized funding. Even with the burden of finance lifted, there were another two years of alteration of formation and command before six oddly-assorted ships moved down from Norfolk to Hampton Roads on August 9, 1838. On August 17, after being joined by the tenders (Sea Gull and Flying-Fish) Lt. Wilkes received his final orders and at 15:00 hours the afternoon of August 18 the vessels weighed anchor. Due to light breezes the expedition did not discharge their pilots until 09:00 August 19 when they passed Cape Henry Light. By 11:00 the small fleet was standing to open seas.

Originally the Expedition was first organized under 
Commodore Thomas Ap Catesby Jones, however 
he subsequently resigned the station. 
Several more senior officers had either resigned from or
indicated their unwillingness to accept command of the expedition. 
Command was finally vested in U.S. Navy Lieutenant Charles Wilkes.

The three duties laid down were daunting to officers trained only in fighting ships. In addition to exploration, the naval squadron was tasked with the duties to survey both the newly found areas and survey other areas previously discovered, but about which there was insufficient knowledge. As well, a scientific corps, of all civilians, was to be included an additional command responsibility. There were few officers in the U.S. Navy at that time with any surveying experience and none with a background of working alongside scientists. The United States Coast Survey, where most of the surveyors were employed and learned their trade, was a civilian organization. Wilkes, who had largely trained himself in surveying work, cut the excessively large number of scientists down to nine. He then reserved for himself, and other naval officers, some of the scientific duties, including all those connected with surveying and cartography.

Personnel included naturalists, botanists, a mineralogist, taxidermists and a philologist, and was carried by the sloops-of-war Vincennes (780 tons) and Peacock (650 tons), the brig Porpoise (230 tons), the store-ship Relief, and two tenders, Sea Gull (110 tons) and Flying Fish (96 tons).



\subsection{Route of the expedition}

Upon clearing the Cape Henry Light at 09:00 on Saturday, August 19, 1838, Lt. Wilkes laid in his course for Rio de Janeiro. By orders, he was to survey certain reported vigias, or shoals at latitude 10\textdegree South and between longitudes 18\textdegree and 22\textdegree West. Due to the prevailing winds at this season, the Squadron made an easterly tack of the Atlantic.

The Squadron arrived at the harbor of Funchal Madeira Islands on September 16, 1838. After completing some repairs the group moved southward and arrived on October 7 at the bay of Porto Praya, Cape Verde Islands eventually arriving at Rio de Janeiro on November 23. The entire passage from the United States to Brazil taking 95 days, about twice the time normally for a vessel proceeding directly. Due to repairs needed by the Peacock, the Squadron did not leave Rio de Janerio until January 6, 1839. From there they moved southward to Buenos Aries and the mouth of the R\'io Negro River, passing a French Naval blockade of the Argentine Republic's seaport. The European powers at the time, with the aid of Brazil, were involved in the internal affairs of the Argentine Republic. However, since the US Squadron had reduced its military profile prior to its departure from the United States, they were not molested by the French warships.

Following this beginning, the Squadron visited Tierra del Fuego, Chile, and Peru. The USS Sea Gull and its crew of fifteen were lost during a South American coastal storm in May, 1839. From South America, the expedition visited the Tuamotu Archipelago, Samoa and New South Wales, Australia. In December 1839, the expedition sailed from Sydney into the Antarctic Ocean and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands". That part of Antarctica was later named "Wilkes Land". Because of discrepancies in the logs of the various ships of the Wilkes expedition, and suggestions that these may have been subsequently altered, it is uncertain whether the Wilkes expedition, or the French expedition of Jules Dumont d'Urville, was the first to sight the Antarctic mainland coast in this vicinity. The controversy was added to by the actions of the commander of the USS Porpoise, Lieutenant Ringgold, who, after sighting d'Urville's Astrolabe deliberately avoided contact.

Following this, the expedition visited Fiji. In July 1840, two members of the party, Lieutenant Underwood and Wilkes' nephew, Midshipman Wilkes Henry, were killed while bartering for food in western Fiji's Malolo Island. The cause of this event remains equivocal. Immediately prior to their deaths the son of the local chief, who was being held as a hostage by the Americans, escaped by jumping out of the boat and running through the shallow water for shore. The Americans fired over his head. According to members of the expedition party on the boat, his escape was intended as a prearranged signal by the Fijians to attack. According to those on shore the shooting actually precipitated the attack on the shore party. Close to 80 Fijians were killed in the resulting American reprisal and some villages were burned to the ground.[1] After Fiji, the expedition sailed to Hull Island, later known as Orona, and the Hawaiian Islands.


In 1841, the expedition explored the west coast of the United States, including the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, and the Columbia River.

Like his predecessor, British explorer George Vancouver, Wilkes spent a good deal of time near Bainbridge Island. He noted the bird-like shape of the harbor at Winslow and named it Eagle Harbor. Continuing his fascination with bird names, he named Bill Point and Wing Point. Port Madison, Washington and Points Monroe and Jefferson named in honor of former U.S. presidents. Port Ludlow was assigned to honor Lt. Augustus Ludlow, who lost his life in an 1813 sea battle.

The Peacock was lost in July 1841 on the Columbia River, though with no loss of life, thanks to a canoe rescue by John Dean, an African American servant of the Vincennes purser, and a group of Chinook Indians. Dean also rescued the expedition's artist, Alfred Agate, along with his paintings and drawings. Upon learning that the Peacock had foundered on the Columbia River Bar, Wilkes interrupted his work in the San Juan Islands and sailed south. He never returned to Puget Sound.

From the area of modern-day Portland, Oregon, an overland party headed by George F. Emmons was directed to proceed via an inland route to San Francisco Bay. This Emmons party traveled south along the Siskiyou Trail, including the Sacramento River, making the first official recorded visit by Americans to and scientific note of Mt. Shasta, in northern California.

The Emmons party rejoined the ships, which had sailed south, in San Francisco. The expedition then headed back out into the Pacific, including a visit to Wake Island in 1841, and returned by way of the Philippines, the Sulu Archipelago, Borneo, Singapore, Polynesia and the Cape of Good Hope, reaching New York on June 10, 1842.

The expedition throughout was plagued by poor relationships between Wilkes and his subordinate officers. 

Wilkes' self-proclaimed status as "Captain" and "Commodore" 
(accompanied by the flying of the requisite pennant and the 
wearing of a Captain's uniform while being commissioned only as a Lieutenant) 
rankled heavily with other members of the expedition of similar real rank. 
His apparent mistreatment of many of his subordinates, 
and indulgence in punishments such as "flogging round the fleet" 
resulted in a major controversy on his return to America.[1] 
Wilkes was court-martialled on his return, 
but was acquitted on all charges except that of illegally punishing men in his squadron.

\subsection{The publication program}

For a short time Wilkes was attached to the Coast Survey, but from 1844 to 1861 he was chiefly engaged in preparing the report of the expedition. Twenty-eight volumes were planned but only nineteen were published. Of these Wilkes wrote the Narrative (1845) and the volumes Hydrography and Meteorology (1851). The Narrative contains much interesting material concerning the manners and customs and political and economic conditions in many places then little known. Other valuable contributions were the three reports of James Dwight Dana on Zoophytes (1846), Geology (1849) and Crustacea (1852-1854).

In addition to many shorter articles and reports,
 Wilkes published the major scientific works Western America, 
 including California and Oregon (1849) and Theory of the Winds (1856).
 

\subsection{Some Notes on Porpoise II - the ship referred to the above Letter}


The second Porpoise, a hermaphrodite brig, was authorized by Congress 30 June 1834; built in 1835; and launched 31 May 1836; Lt. William Ramsay in command.

Porpoise sailed from Boston 25 August 1836, called at various southern ports, and conducted coastal surveying operations under the direction of Lt. Charles Wilkes in the summer of 1837. In October 1837 she hunted pirates along the southern coast, and then resumed her survey work in December.

Porpoise, Lt. Cadwallader Ringgold in command, was then assigned to the squadron which Wilkes was to command on an extended exploratory expedition around the world. She stood out of Hampton Roads 18 August 1838 with the United States Exploring Expedition Squadron. She assisted in the exploration and survey work of the Expedition as it confirmed the existence of the Antarctic Continent, charted vast areas of the South Pacific, circumnavigated the world, and returned to New York four years later.


Porpoise underwent overhaul at New York at the end of 1842 and sailed 8 February 1843 for the west coast of Africa to join the squadron patrolling for slavers. She returned to New York 19 November 1844.


Between February 1845 and July 1847, Porpoise cruised in the Gulf of Mexico, participating in the Naval operations against Tampico, Panuco, and Vera Cruz during the War with Mexico. Upon return to Norfolk, she decommissioned until 1 January 1848.

 

During the next three and a half years she hunted slavers along the west coast of Africa, touching at the United States in the spring of 1850. Returning to New York from this extended cruise 19 December 1851. She again decommissioned 3 August 1852.

 

Recommissioned in May 1853, she was assigned to an exploring squadron under Comdr. Cadwallader Ringgold, 
a veteran, like Porpoise, of the Wilkes Expedition. 
She joined the squadron at Hampton Roads, and with it, stood out to sea 11 June 1853. 
Porpoise rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and with the squadron explored and 
charted many Pacific islands and shoals before arriving in China in March 1854. 
The squadron put to sea once more to explore in the Bonins, the Ladrones, and the Marianas. 

Porpoise parted company with the other vessels 21 September 1854 between Formosa and China, 
and was never heard from again. 
It is supposed that she foundered in a heavy typhoon 
which occurred a few days after her separation from the squadron
