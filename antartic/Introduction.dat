# Stamps and Postal History of Antartic Exploration

Seamen theorized that a land mass would be found at the southern tip of the earth, but exploration was not undertaken until the early nineteenth century. Severe weather and blinding fog in the region cloaked it from view. Sealers and whalers worked in the area, but finally the Russian Czar sent a small exploration fleet to examine the southern regions and their visit, coupled with the sighting by a sealer captain, confirmed that there was in fact a land mass at the southern tip of the world.[1]

Since that time, there have been many parties in ships and other vehicles, including dog teams and aircraft, searching the icy continent for its secrets and treasures. They have formed a frustrating puzzle of origin, life forms and resources, and all of them remain almost beyond understanding and reach.
