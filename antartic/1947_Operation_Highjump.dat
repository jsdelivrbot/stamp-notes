After World War II, from 1946--47, Byrd was instrumental in the Navy's 
Operation Highjump that charted most of the Antarctic coastline. 
In 1948, Commander Finn Ronne led an expion that photographed 
over 450,000 square miles (1.1 million km2) by air. Then, 
in 1954-55, the icebreaker USS Atka (AGB-3)  made a scouting 
expedition for future landing sites and bays.
