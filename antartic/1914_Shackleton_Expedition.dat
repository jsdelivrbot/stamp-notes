\chapter{1914 Shakleton Expedition}
The Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914--17), also known as the Endurance Expedition, was the last major expedition of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Conceived by Sir Ernest Shackleton, the expedition sought to achieve the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent. After the conquest of the South Pole by Roald Amundsen in 1911, the crossing remained, in Shackleton's words, the "one great main object of Antarctic journeyings".[1] The expedition failed entirely to accomplish this aim, but it remains memorable as an epic of heroism and survival.

Shackleton had served in the Antarctic on Captain Scott's Discovery Expedition, 1901--04, and had led the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907--09. The new expedition required a main party to sail to the Weddell Sea and to land a shore party at around latitude 78 degrees S, in the vicinity of Vahsel Bay, in preparation for a transcontinental march via the South Pole to the Ross Sea. A supporting group, the Ross Sea party, would meanwhile travel to the opposite side of the continent, establish camp in McMurdo Sound, and from there lay a series of supply depots across the Ross Ice Shelf to the foot of the Beardmore Glacier. These depots would be essential for the transcontinental party's survival, as they would not carry enough provisions to make the crossing otherwise.

1914-16 British Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, a spectacular 1914 deregulated O.H.M.S. envelope from Sydney and addressed to "Sir E.H. Shackleton C.V.O./S.Y. Endurance/Imperial Transantarctic Expedition/Buenos Aires/Argentina", franked with an Australia 2 1/2p "Kangaroo" adhesive (faults) and tied by "Sydney/Oc 14/1914" machine cancel, light Buenos Aires arrival backstamps, some cover soiling, fine; an incredibly important cover addressed to not only a member of this expedition, but its leader.At the auction sale of the important Discovery collection of Antarctica in May 1990, two covers were addressed to members of the Expedition at the Expedition Office in London and were confirmed as the only examples of incoming mail to the expedition so far recorded. This is clearly a third, and of considerably greater rarity, as it is addressed specifically to the expedition leader, en route to Antarctica after the expedition had commenced, and not general mail addressed to the Expedition's London Office. Its desirability especially enhanced by being franked with a popular Australian "Kangaroo" stamp - certainly one of the most unique covers known bearing this denomination.    	Est. $2,000-3,000

 The expedition required two ships; the Endurance would take Shackleton's party to the Weddell Sea, and the Aurora, under Captain Aeneas Mackintosh, would take the Ross Sea party to McMurdo Sound.

Endurance became beset in the ice of the Weddell Sea before reaching Vahsel Bay, and despite efforts to free the ship, she drifted northward with the pack throughout the Antarctic winter of 1915. Eventually, the ice crushed and sank the ship, stranding her 28-man complement on the ice and subjecting them to a series of harrowing episodes months spent in makeshift camps on the ice, a journey in lifeboats to Elephant Island, an 800-mile (1,300 km) open-boat journey in the James Caird, and the first crossing of South Georgia that led eventually to their rescue without a single fatality. Meanwhile, the Ross Sea party overcame great hardships to fulfill its mission, after Aurora was blown from her moorings during a gale and could not return. The depots were laid, but three lives were lost in the process.

Shackleton thought that he would need \pound50,000 (2008 approximation \pound2.2 million) to carry out the simplest version of his plan.[14][15] He did not believe in appeals to the public: "(they) cause endless book-keeping worries".[16] His chosen method of fund-raising was to solicit contributions from wealthy backers, and he had begun this process early in 1913, with little initial success.[17] His first significant break came in December 1913 when the Government offered him \pound10,000,[14] a useful sum, but only half what they had subscribed to enable Shackleton to pay off the Nimrod Expedition's debts.[18] 

The Royal Geographical Society, from which he had expected nothing, gave him \pound1,000 according to Huntford, Shackleton, in a grand gesture, advised them that he would only need to take up half of this sum.[19] With time running out, contributions were eventually secured during the spring and early summer of 1914. Dudley Docker of the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA)[20] gave \pound10,000, wealthy tobacco heiress Janet Stancomb-Wills gave a "generous" sum (the amount was not revealed), and, in June, Scottish industrialist Sir James Caird donated \pound24,000. "This magnificent gift relieves me of all anxiety", Shackleton informed the Morning Post.[21]

Shackleton now had the money to proceed. For \pound14,000[14] he acquired a 300-ton barquentine called Polaris, which had been built for the Belgian explorer Adrien de Gerlache for an expedition to Spitsbergen. This scheme had collapsed and the ship became available.[22] Shackleton changed her name to Endurance, reflecting his family motto "By endurance we conquer".[14] He also acquired, for \pound3,200, Douglas Mawson's expedition ship Aurora, which was lying in Hobart, Tasmania, as the Ross Sea party's vessel.

The total amount raised by Shackleton is uncertain, since the size of the Stancomb-Wills donation is not known. However money, or rather the lack of it, haunted the expedition.[23] As an economy measure the proportion of funding allocated to the Ross Sea party was summarily halved, as the party's commander Aeneas Mackintosh discovered only when he arrived in Australia to take up his command.[24] Mackintosh was forced to haggle and plead for money and supplies to make his part of the expedition viable.[25] Lack of money would also hamper the operation to rescue the Ross Sea party when this need arose in 1916.[26] Shackleton did have an eye on recouping costs after his return, though: he sold the exclusive rights to the expedition's story to the Daily Chronicle, and formed the Imperial Trans Antarctic Film Syndicate to take advantage of the film rights.[27][28]



\subsection{Weddell Sea party}

\subsection{Voyage through the ice}

Endurance left Plymouth on 8 August 1914, stopping briefly in Buenos Aires where Hurley came on board, and William Bakewell and stowaway Perce Blackborow were added to the crew.[37] After a final month-long halt in Grytviken, South Georgia, Endurance departed for the Antarctic on 5 December. Two days later Shackleton was disconcerted to encounter pack ice as far north as 57\textdegrees26' S,[38] forcing the ship to manoeuvre. During the following days there were more tussles with the pack, which on 14 December was thick enough to halt the ship for 24 hours. Three days later the ship was stopped again. Shackleton commented: "I had been prepared for evil conditions in the Weddell Sea, but had hoped that the pack would be loose. What we were encountering was fairly dense pack of a very obstinate character".[39]

\subsection{Working to free the ship}

Progress was delayed by frequent halts until leads opened up and Endurance was able to proceed steadily southward on 22 December. This remained the case for the next two weeks, taking the ship deep into the Weddell Sea. Further delays slowed progress during the early days of 1915, although from 7--10 January a lengthy run south brought them close to the 100-foot (30 m) tall ice walls which masked the Antarctic coastal region of Coats Land, discovered and named by William Speirs Bruce in 1904.[40] On 15 December Endurance came abreast of a great glacier, the edge of which formed a bay which looked like an excellent landing place. However there was no question of landing so far north of Vahsel Bay, "except under pressure of necessity", a decision that Shackleton would later regret.[41] On 17 January, after a long run of 124 miles (200 km), the ship reached 76\textdegrees 27"S, where land was observed which Shackleton named Caird Coast, after his principal sponsor. Bad weather forced them to shelter in the lee of a stranded berg.

They were now close to Luitpold Land, at the southern end of which lay their destination, Vahsel Bay. Next day, the ship was forced westward for 14 miles (23 km), resuming in a southerly and then briefly north-westerly direction, before being stopped altogether.[41] The position was 76\textdegrees34' S, 31\textdegrees30'W. 

It soon became clear that Endurance was now trapped in the ice, and after ten days of inactivity the ship's fires were banked, to save fuel.[41] Efforts continued to release her; on 14 February Shackleton ordered men on to the ice with ice-chisels, prickers, saws and picks, to try and force a passage, but the effort proved futile. Shackleton did not abandon all hope of breaking free, but now contemplated the "possibility of having to spend a winter in the inhospitable arms of the pack".[42]

Antartic postal history material is both of a historical nature as well as of a postal. The latter is perhaps to a degree
philatelic and in my opinion collections should tell both stories well. The envelope illustrated to the left is an
example of such material. It indicates that the New zealand authorities - who viewed Shackleton as a hero- did not tax
the letter, neither did the letter get taxed in the UK.
