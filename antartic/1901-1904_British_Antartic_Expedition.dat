The British National Antarctic Expedition, 1901--04, generally known as the __Discovery Expedition__, 
was the first official British exploration of the Antarctic regions since James Clark Ross's voyage sixty years earlier. Organised on a large scale under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition aimed to carry out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration[1] including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, 
Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly.

As a trailbreaker for later ventures, the Discovery Expedition was a landmark
in British Antarctic exploration history. After its return home it was celebrated
as a success, despite having needed an expensive relief mission to free Discovery
and its crew from the ice, and later disputes about the quality of some of its
scientific records. It has been asserted that the expedition's main failure was
its inability to master the techniques of efficient polar travel using skis and dogs,[3]
a legacy that persisted in British Antarctic expeditions throughout the Heroic Age.

The National Antarctic Expedition Committee, through Wrench Printers of London,
produced a limited set of four special postcards - Wrench's 'Links of Empire'
Postcards Series 3. These were sold for two shillings per set and were to
provide additional funds for the expedition and for Discovery officers and
crew to send home as souvenirs from selected points along the journey.
