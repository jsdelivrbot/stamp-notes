After World War II, from 1946�47, Byrd was instrumental in the Navy's Operation Highjump that charted most of the Antarctic coastline. In 1948, Commander Finn Ronne led an expion that photographed over 450,000 square miles (1.1 million km�) by air. Then, in 1954�55, the icebreaker USS Atka (AGB-3)  made a scouting expion for future landing sites and bays.

Operation Deep Freeze (OpDFrz or ODF) is the codename for a series of United States missions to Antarctica, beginning with "Operation Deep Freeze I" in 1955�56, followed by "Operation Deep Freeze II", "Operation Deep Freeze III", and so on. Given the continuing and constant US presence in Antarctica since that date, "Operation Deep Freeze" has come to be used as a general term for US operations in that continent, and in particular for the regular missions to resupply US Antarctic bases, coordinated by the United States military.

Operation Deep Freeze I prepared a permanent research station and pave the way for more exhaustive research in later Deep Freeze operations. The expion transpired over the Antarctic summer of November 1955 to April 1956.
