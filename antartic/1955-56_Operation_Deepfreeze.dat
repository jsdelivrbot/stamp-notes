\section{Operation Deepfreeze I}

\textit{Operation Deep Freeze} (OpDFrz or ODF) was the codename for a 
series of United States missions to Antarctica, 
beginning with "Operation Deep Freeze I" in 1955--56, followed by 
"Operation Deep Freeze II", "Operation Deep Freeze III", and so on. 
Given the continuing and constant US presence in Antarctica since that date, 
"Operation Deep Freeze" has come to be used as a general term for US operations 
in that continent, and in particular for the regular missions to resupply US 
Antarctic bases, coordinated by the United States military.

Operation Deep Freeze I prepared a permanent research 
station and paved the way for more exhaustive research in later 
Deep Freeze operations. The expedition took place  over the Antarctic 
summer of November 1955 to April 1956.
