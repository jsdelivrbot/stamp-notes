\chapter{Alaouites}  

The Alawite State or the Alaouites (Fr.) is located between Hatay and 
the Lebanon. 
Geographically within Syria, Alawi was administered under a French mandate 
between 1920 and 1930 and 
as the Sanjak of Latakia from 1930. From 5 December 1936 (effective in 1937) it was fully incorporated 
into Syria. 


France never designed postage stamps specifically for Alawite. There was an initial period in 
which Syrian stamps were used, inevitably causing accounting difficulties between the Alawite and 
Syrian postal services. 

In 1925, French stamps were overprinted \textsc{alaouites} followed by a denomination in piastres 
(French stamps being denominated in francs) and this was followed by the same information in Arabic.


Later between 1925 and 1930, similar overprints were used on stamps of Syria. Airmail overprints 
included the word "AVION" and after 1926 a picture of a monoplane.
