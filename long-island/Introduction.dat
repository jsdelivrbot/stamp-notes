## The Long Island Stamps
###Postal Issue of 6th May, 1916

 Imagine an Island 25 sq. km, dry and inhabited by 41 people establishing its
 own Pstal Service. Although a true story, it is more of a philatelists/soldier
 come true story.
 
 Strategically situated it controls the entrance of Izmir (then called Smyrna), and is still restricted Turkish Navy area. The island was occupied in April 1916 by the Fourth Squadron of the Royal Navy, Mediterranean Fleet, with the monitor M30, blockading the Gulf. The coast of Asia Minor had been under bombardment since early 1915; the Gulf of Izmir was under fire in March 1915.

During the First World War an island off the coast of Turkey 
was occupied by Allied forces. These stamps can sometimes be found 
under Turkey but are mostly sought after by collectors interested 
in British Europe. They rarely come on the market and when they do 
prices are almost unpredictable sometimes fetching over the Stanley 
Gibbons prices.

Postage and Revenue stamp on thin laid paper with red initials, approximately 150

The Turkish island of Chustan, {{wi:Kuestan}} or Makronisi in Greek, located in the Gulf of Smyrna was occupied
by the 4th Detached Squadron of the Meditteranean Fleet early in 1916. The population at the time
was reported as three officers thirty marines and eight Greek workmen. Later, however, a Civil Administrator was
appointed, whose activities embraced _inter alia_ the establishment of a postal service and the issue of
special postage stamps.

A "post office" was opened on 7 May and typewritten stamps were issued in very small numbers. They were, of course, not really necessary, and only Gibbons is listing them, at high prices. The stamps were not meant for the few local inhabitants (now there are no civilians). In Jan. 1919 Uzun (as well as other Turkish fortifications in the Gulf) was briefly taken control of by the Royal Navy in support of the Greek occupation of the Izmir region. Further reading: Fred. J. Melville, Stamp Books No. 22, London 1916.

Details of both the stamps were published by authority in the first issue of the _Long Island Gasette_.


As the supply of captured Turkish fiscal stamps which have been overprinted and adpated for posal use,
was inadequate for the needs of the Island a supplementary supply of typewritten stamps was prepared.

In order to comply as far as possible with the colour-rules of the Postal union, green paper
was at first used for the halfpenny stamps and the first impression of the 13 plates of penny stamps
was in red.

{{bulb:The island was evacuated on May 26th 1916, the typewritten Long Island stamps discontinued, and the remainders were returned to the Admiralty, by
whom they were officially destroyed.}}

The following is a selection of Long Island Rarities in catalogue order. Understandably a number of images are missing. If you are a collector of Long island and have any images you will like to share with the rest of us please consider contributing.

## Notes on Pricing

Selling through a well accepted and honest firm, such as Cavendish ensures that market related prices are obtained. When these lots
were listed I was sure that they were undepriced. The realizations reflected these with most of the lots
sold for at least four times the estimates. Good material comes on the market once evey 15-20 years. Collectors
place a value on these stamps and covers and bid to get them. They will ignore both stanley Gibbons numbers as well
as the auctioneers estimates!

LONG ISLAND / UZUNADA or KEUSTAN

Turkish: Uzun Ada (Uzun Adasi, Uzan Ada, previously called Keustan, Chustan), Greek: Makronisi, renamed Long Island by the British soldiers. 25 sq. km, 202 m high. Strategically situated it controls the entrance of Izmir (then called Smyrna), and is still restricted Turkish Navy area. The island was occupied in April 1916 by the Fourth Squadron of the Royal Navy, Mediterranean Fleet, with the monitor M30, blockading the Gulf. The coast of Asia Minor had been under bombardment since early 1915; the Gulf of Izmir was under fire in March 1915.

On 14 May the M30 is hit by Turkish shore-based gunfire and sinks. With the airfield also unusable Long Island is shortly abandoned (in June?). A "post office" was opened on 7 May and typewritten stamps were issued in very small numbers. They were, of course, not really necessary, and only Gibbons is listing them, at high prices. The stamps were not meant for the few local inhabitants (now there are no civilians). In Jan. 1919 Uzun (as well as other Turkish fortifications in the Gulf) was briefly taken control of by the Royal Navy in support of the Greek occupation of the Izmir region. Further reading: Fred. J. Melville, Stamp Books No. 22, London 1916.

The monitor M30, Lt. Cdr. E. L. B. Lockyer, was engaged in the bombardment of Turkish batteries in the neighbourhood of Cape Aspro, Gulf of Smyrna, during May 1916. On the night of the 13th the monitor was hit in the engine room by gunfire from shore batteries and caught fire. About 50 of the crew, including wounded, were taken off by the armed motor yacht California and the monitor sank shortly afterwards.
