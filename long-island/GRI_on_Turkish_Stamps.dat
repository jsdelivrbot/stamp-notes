# Long Island (Makronisi) Stamps Overpinted on Turkish revenues

The Turkish island of Chustan, Kuestan or Makronisi in Greek, located in the Gulf of Smyrna was occupied by the 4th Detached Squadron of the Meditteranean Fleet early May 1916. The local Civil Administrator issued stamps made with the aid of a typewriter, which were inscribed "G.R.I. LONG ISLAND", Postage and Revenue value; also "G.R.I. Postage" and new value overprinted on Turkish fiscal stamps. 

The issues were short-lived (7th to 26th May, 1916)---unused and particularly used stamps are of considerable rarity. their necessity or validity as an official issue is questionable as the British Forces letters did not require prepayment and the likelihood of the natives being allowed to communicate with the outside world improbable. 

The typewritten issues bristle with errors, due particularly to the lack of skill of the typist, and in greater degree to the isiosyncrancies of the typewriter.

As Robson Lowe wrote: the fortunate blending of undexterity and typewriter individuality has resulted in the impossibility of producing any forgery that cannot be readily detected.

Three values are known catalogued by Stanly Gibbons as the first stamps of Long Island (SG1-3). The three values 1/2d, 1d and 2 1/2 d were presumably for local use, Imperial penny post and the 2 1/2 to overseas destinations. With some 30 people on the island ot a great amount of correspondence was expected. \ref{sg3a} and \ref{sg3} illustrate clearly the variations expected from a typewriter, and getting the typing vertically aligned. On the latter the "G.R.I" almost lines up with the value tablet whereas on the former it is about half a centimeter below. 

The three overpinted revenues are very rare and the known mint quantities are 11-13 each. I am not too sure if there are any in the Royal collection.

The population at the time
was reported as three officers thirty marines and eight Greek workmen. Later, however, a Civil Administrator was
appointed, whose activities embraced _inter alia_ the establishment of a postal service and the issue of
special postage stamps.

Details of both the stamps were published by authority in the first issue of the _Long Island Gazette_.


As the supply of captured Turkish fiscal stamps which have been overprinted and adpated for posal use,
was inadequate for the needs of the Island a supplementary supply of typewritten stamps was prepared.

The numbers of the captured overprinted Turkish fiscal stamps are said to have been 25 for the 1/2 d. on 20 paras,
25 of the 1d. on 10 paras, and 20 of the 2 1/2 d. on 1 piastre. The captured Turkish fiscal stamps are
overprinted __G.R.I.__ and __Postage__ with the value.
