THE RAREST STAMP OF MACAU. 

The legendary locally overprinted "Republica" 10 avos has been written about in the literature from Macau since at least 1933 (cf. Macau Filatelica Vol. 1, no. 3 (Dec. 1933) listing by Jose Marco) and was included in the 1937 catalogue edited by Macau Filatelica (as no. 199). It was similarly included in Neues Handbuch der Biefmarkenkunde (Frankfurt am Main, 1934). It, however, was omitted from the listing of the issue prepared by Carlos George and not included in the stamp catalogues published in Portugal and Spain.

A contemporary confidential postal report into the issuance of the 1911-13 locally overprinted and surcharges issues discovered at the Overseas Historical Archive in Lisbon in the last decade provides a listing of the number of stamps of each denomination overprinted with the local "Republica" overprint: 10 examples of the Don Carlos I 10 avos are listed as overprinted, definitively documenting the stamp's overprinting by the Macau Post Office. There is likewise a manuscript document in the Macau archives again showing 10 examples of the 10 avos being overprinted in the listing for the set.

Interestingly, this overprinting was contrary to Decree No. 20 (4 July 1913) to all Portuguese Colonies that stamps of which 1,000 or more existed in stock were to be overprinted "Republica" locally and may have been the reason, according to LucaÂ­s Frazcao, the eminent Macau scholar, it was omitted from information provided Carlos George. However, because of misunderstanding of local authorities, the Governor of Macau subsequently issued Executive Order No. 234, published in Macau 20 Sept. 1913, that "all stamps existing in stock (irrelevant of number) should be overprinted at once and put on sale", in effect countermanding Decree No. 20.

It had been earlier written by Mr. Fraz\~ao in his Handbook that a sheet of 28 stamps had been overprinted. With the discovery of the record from the Overseas Historical Archive, it can now be stated definitively that only 10 examples were overprinted. Five of the locally overprinted 10 avos are in the Macau Postal Museum, having come from the collection of Correa Nunes, a well-known collector who lived in Macau from the thirties to the fifties. Thus, a maximum of five examples are available for collectors. As a further gauge of its immense rarity, the locally overprinted "Republica" 10 avos was missing from the legendary Seabra collection auctioned in 1993.
