 Macau, 1827 (4 May) entire letter datelined from "Ilha do Norte" 
 (Island of the North) to Lisbon, in which the author mentions 
 that "I have not been able to send you from Macao a copy of 
 this letter with the bill of lading \ldots but now that we have 
 arrived after a 42 days passage to the Island of the North, 
 I will leave this here to take the first available ship heading 
 to your direction", fine. Another example of the practice of 
 sending multiple copies of letters to ensure that one would arrive
 at the destination; in this case, the writer was unable to send the 
 duplicate letters from Macao.
