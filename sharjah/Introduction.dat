##Sharjah and Dependencies

\ph[60%]{../sharjah/Sharjah-01.JPG}{ }


Sharjah is one of the sand dune Emirates. I actually lived there in the late seventies and early eighties. At the time it was a small ugly town with a picturesque sea-front, very much underdeveloped and with a trade that was primarily through boat from Iraq and Iran.

Civil mail from {{wi:Sharjah_(emirate)}} went through the post office in Dubai until 1963. Military mail from the British Forces stationed in the area went through the RAF airport in Sharjah.

On 10 July 1963, Sharjah opened its own post office and began to issue its stamps and postal stationery under the name of Sharjah & Dependencies (which included Kalba, {{wi:Khor_Fakkan}}, and {{wi:Dibbah}}). There were also unauthorized overprints using {{wi:Himriyyah}}, a name of a village in the sheikhdom. Sharjah and its dependencies joined the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, but it continued to issue its own stamps. On 31 July 1972, the UAE assumed full postal responsibilities. Nevertheless, Sharjah continued to use its own stamps until the issuance of the first UAE definitive series on 1 January 1973.
