The third definitive set issued by the British Postal Agencies of Eastern Arabia. It comprises of 10 values issued on 4 different dates. The first 2 values were issued on the 5th December 1952 – 1½ Anna and 2½ Annas.
The issue was valid for use throught the British Postal Agencies of the Gulf.

{{wi:Arabia}} refers to a region that includes current Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates.
These stamps were issued for use in post offices in the Gulf other 
than Bahrain and Kuwait (though they were valid there). 
In 1951 and 1953 they were expressly sold in Kuwait due to local shortages of "Kuwait" overprints.


A postal service was operated in the Gulf by the Indian postal administration in Bombay from 1884. With the independence of India in 1947 responsibility passed to the British GPO on 1 April 1947, though the postal services remained under the control of Karachi, transferring from Indian to Pakistani administration in August 1947 until the GPO was ready to take over on 1 April 1948. For this reason the previously overprinted Indian stamps were replaced by overprinted GB stamps in 1948. Bahrain and Kuwait continued with overprinted stamps, but the rest of the area now adopted currency surcharges on British stamps but without a country name.


Note: Originally primarily used in Muscat these issues have often been listed under that name in catalogues. Other variants of the country heading in catalogues include: "Muscat and Eastern Arabian Agencies", "Muscat and Dubai and Arabian Gulf Agencies", or (eg in some American listings) "Oman". The current designation in the UK is "British Postal Agencies in Eastern Arabia", since it more accurately reflects the wide usage in Muscat (1948-1966), Qatar (1950-1957), Abu Dhabi (1960-1964), Dubai (1948-1961).


Although superficially the overprints look exactly the same as those used for the Bahrain and Kuwait issues, there is an interesting situation with the George VI 1½ annas stamps. The top half of the sheet uses a figure "1" which is slightly shorter (3¼ mm) than in the bottom half of the sheet (3½ mm); although this means that they exist in equal numbers, se-tenant pairs (ie vertical pairs across the middle of the sheet) are extremely elusive since sheets were commonly split in half before sale. Interestingly on the equivalent surcharges for other Gulf territories, the Bahrain issue uses only the tall version of the fraction, and Kuwait uses only the short version; this may tell us something about the order in which the overprinting plates were set up.

It also proves that it is not the case (as sometimes suggested) that the three issues were printed from the same printing plate with "Bahrain" or "Kuwait" swapped or omitted (though this may the case for the QE issues; see note on "fonts" under the Queen Elizabeth definitives).


All stamps are overprinted with value only, with no country name.
