German post offices in China
China, 1905

German post offices in China (German: Deutsche Post in China) started to operate in 1886. Initially definitive stamps were used without overprint; their use in China is only recognizable by the cancellation stamp. In 1898 "China"-overprinted stamps were issued. From 1900 onwards, the Germania stamps were used with "China" overprints. In addition, after 1905, instead of (Reichs)Mark and Pfennig, the valuta was changed to dollars and cents. German post offices closed after China declared war on Germany on March 3, 1917. [3]

Post offices existed in these towns (name per cancellation stamps):[4]

    * Shanghai
    * Tientsin
    * Tschifu
    * Amoy
    * Kanton
    * Futschau
    * Nanking
    * Peking
    * Swatau
    * Tsinanfu
    * Tschinkiang
    * Tongku
    * Weihsien
    * Itschang
    * Tschingtschoufu
    * Tschonsun

In addition, during the Boxer rebellion (1900-01) ten military mail offices were maintained.[5]
