# The Postage Stamps of Mafeking

Mafeking was invested November 12th 1899, and relieved May 17th 1900.

In March 1900 a system of Kaffirgrams (mail carried by a a Kaffir runner), was organized. The risks were
considerable and the pay of the runners was very high. mail conveyed in this manner was charge 1 /- per 1/2 oz. via Bulawayo (rhodesia) or
6d., via Kimberley southwards).

The evidence of the covers shows that the mail was carried northwards via Bulawayo.

The local rates were 1/2 oz - within town limits 1 d., to Outposts and forts, 3d.. Newspaers 1/2 d., per paper. Book post
1/2 d. per oz.

The forme of the set up consisted of six subjects only. The first of which had a comma after Mafeking, so that only one row of a pane
of 60-6x10 was printed a a time. There are at least four separate printings as indicated by the different
spacing of the overprint.
