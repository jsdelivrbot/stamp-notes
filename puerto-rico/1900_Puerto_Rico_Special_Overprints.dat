\section{1900 Puerto Rico Special Overprints}
In 1900 one pane of 100 stamps of each was prepared for display at the Paris and Pan-American Expositions. The 5\cent, 8\cent and 10\cent were never regularly issued with the "Puerto Rico" spelling and so are only known as Special Printings. Many were destroyed after the exhibitions. There are very few sets known and the stamps are not seen often. \ref{one}, \ref{two},  


\ph[70%]{../puerto-rico/1378.jpg}{1378		1900, 1c-10c "Porto Rico" Overprints, Special Printing for Pan-American Exposition (212SP-216SP). Original gum, h.r., with black "Special Surcharge" and "HFC" (Colman) in circle handstamps on back, 5c tiny thin spot
FINE AND RARE SET OF THE 1901 "PORTO RICO" SPECIAL PRINTINGS. THIS IS THE ONLY INTACT SET KNOWN.

The Scott Catalogue incorrectly states in its footnote on page 684 of the Specialized catalogue that 1) no Special Printing panes overprinted "Porto Rico" were produced by the government, and 2) that Bartels signed some copies in pencil and handstamped others in red. According to the Catalogo Filatelico De Puerto Rico, edited by Hugo D. Storer, 100 examples were produced (from one pane) for the Pan American Exposition (p. 92).

FINE. A COMPLETE SET OF THE 1900 PUERTO RICO SPECIAL PRINTINGS WITH "SPECIMEN" OVERPRINTS. A RARE GROUP AS MOST WITH THE "SPECIMEN" OVERPRINTS WERE DESTROYED.

In 1900 one pane of 100 stamps of each was prepared for display at the Paris and Pan-American Expositions. The 5c and 8c were never regularly issued with the "Puerto Rico" spelling and so are only known as Special Printings. Some were overprinted "Specimen" for use at the exhibitions and most of those prepared in this manner were destroyed after the exhibitions ended. These Special Printings are also known signed by Bartels and with "Special Surcharge" in pencil (contemporary) or in red ink (prepared after 1904).
