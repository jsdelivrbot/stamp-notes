\section{1900 Puerto Rico Special Overprints}
In 1900 one pane of 100 stamps of each was prepared for display at the Paris and Pan-American Expositions. The 5\cent, 8\cent and 10\cent were never regularly issued with the "Puerto Rico" spelling and so are only known as Special Printings. Many were destroyed after the exhibitions. There are very few sets known and the stamps are not seen often.
