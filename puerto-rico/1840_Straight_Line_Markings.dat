\section{Puerto Rico}


The postal system in Puerto Rico \ref{figure}  during the 18th and 19th centuries consisted mainly of official  and military mail and was transported by military couriers. Through the king's "Royal Order"  of 1811 the first civilian internal Postal System was placed into operation in 1813 under the direction of Don Esteban  de Ayala as Postmaster. (See \ref{Coamo}).

The system consisted of three major routes, all departing from San Juan, going North West, South and East, with the Postmen travelling in their repective routes, stopping at the main towns before reaching their final destinations at Cabo Rojo, San German and Guayama. The postmen would then journey back to San Juan picking up all return mail along the way. Special couriers designated by local authorities would service towns located out of the main routes. This procedure was repeated every 15 days.

Straight Line Town markings were introduced in the 1840's and almost every Post Office had their own marking. Thy were in general use until the introduction of stamps in 1855, but in some towns they remained in use, on and off, well into the 1880's possibly as temporary replacements for worn out datestamps. Figures 1-9, show markings from various towns. These originally belonged to the collection of Mr. Acevedo and it must stated that the condition is exceptionally good. Mail from the Island, especially mail that was kept in the island is normally heavily oxidized and it is even common to see covers with wormholes and other insect infestation problems.

In 1860 the population of the island was estimated as 583,000 of which only 9% were literate. This resulted in scarcity of postal material during this period, which consisted mostly of "Official" and "Commercial" correspondence.
