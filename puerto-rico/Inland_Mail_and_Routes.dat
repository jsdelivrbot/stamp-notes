The postal system in Puerto Rico during the 18th and 19th centuries consisted mainly of official  and military mail and was transported by military couriers. Through the king's "Royal Order"  of 1811 the first civilian internal Postal System was placed into operation in 1813 under the direction of Don Esteban  de Ayala as Postmaster.   

In 1860 the population of the island was estimated as 583,000 of which only 9% were literate. This resulted in scarcity of postal material during this period, which consisted mostly of "Official" and "Commercial" correspondence. 

The system consisted of three major routes, all departing from San Juan, going North West, South and East, with the Postmen travelling in their repective routes, stopping at the main towns before reaching their final destinations at Cabo Rojo, San German and Guayama. The postmen would then journe back to San Juan picking up all rturn mail along teh way. Special couriers designated by local authorities would service towns located out of the main routes. This procedure was repeated every 15 days.
