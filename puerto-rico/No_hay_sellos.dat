\section{No hay Sellos}

Many times a shortage of stamps at the various Post offices and Government Departments, created a situation where by Royal decree dated 15 April 1856, article 4, senders were allowed to write \textit{"no hay sellos"} meaning "we have no stamps" on the envelope and let the recipient pay.
