# Polynesia Traditional Sports

Aside “va’a ” and surfing, various Ma’ohi disciplines have travelled through the different periods and are still enjoyed by many people, especially during the Heiva festivities in July.

They are numerous and are often linked to activities of Polynesian people’s daily life – past and presents.

The most well known are: javelin throwing, stone lifting, fruit carrier race, the copra contest, coconut tree climbing, etc.

These disciplines require excellent physical conditions but also a certain controlled strategy. When the period of the “Tuaro Ma’ohi ” (Polynesian games) arrives, the excitement reaches its climax.

The inhabitants of Tahiti and Her Islands gather to compete in a friendly way and to support their champions.
