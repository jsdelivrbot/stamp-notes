In 1866 they were perforated 15, and at the same time a change was made in
the colours of the one penny and fourpence values. The following references to
this are to be found in :—
Le Timbre-Poste. Fifth year, 1867, January, page 4.

NEVIS. " A 4 pence vermilion will replace the current 4 pence rose, which
causes errors too frequently on account of its similarity to the i penny of the
same shade."

Le Timbre-Poste. Fifth year, 1867, March, page 21.

NEVIS. " Changes of colour : the i penny is now vermilion ; the 4 p., orange,
and the i sh., dark bluish green. The paper is whiter and the perforation is
smaller : it gauges 14 1/2 instead of 13 in 2 centimetres."        

You have before you a List of Consignments of 1866-1878 given by Mr. E. D.
Bacon in the Catalogue of West Indies, p. no, which he informed us at the time
was supplied to him by Mr. T. Maycock. I should like you to compare the list
with the particulars I have to suggest.

It is probable that Mr. Maycock was unable to provide us with any particulars
of consignments before the year 1866, as we read in the Stamp News Annual
of 1893, p. 52, that Mr. Douglas Mackenzie, in a conversation which he had with
the printers, Messrs. Nissen & Arnold (late Nissen & Parker), was informed that
" nearly all the old documents referring to, and the valuable proofs of, the stamps
which the printers had, were destroyed in a fire which occurred at their works
some years ago, so unfortunately little or no information is now procurable."
'In the List you will find a consignment on December i8th, 1866, of id., 4d.
and is., which must have consisted of the engraved perf. 15 in the new colours,
which Le Timbre-Poste mentions in March 1867. I shall first deal with the is.
value which takes us down to the second consignment of June i6th, 1876, 84 sheets
(1008 stamps), is., green. About ten years had elapsed since the last consignment
of the is., and I am able to place before you a sample engraved sheet in yellowgreen
on which an order is written for 167 sheets (2000 stamps). Mr. T. Maycock,
        
Mr. T. Maycock, writing in the Philatelic Record of February 1906, p. 44, concluded that there was only one consignment of the is. yellow-green engraved, and that only about 1000
stamps were printed, but he was unable to account for the nature of the consignment
of December I3th, 1876.

1876 1/- yellow-green Nissen & Parker. Lower right corner block of four, upper right stamp position 9 showing crossed lines on hill flaw. Superb fresh mint, hinged on upper pair lower unmounted. A wonderful multiple and RARE. R.P.S. certificate (1960). SG 14, 14b

}

You will notice that the order was split into two deliveries, and that the 831%
sheets (1000 stamps) of December I3th, 1876, completed the quantity of the
original order of June i6th for 167 sheets. The rare is. yellow-green on laid paper
arose, without doubt, from a sheet or more of that description being used indiscriminately
in the printing. I have been able to trace the owners of the following
numbers :—

His Majesty the King, No. 8 ; Major T. Charlton Henry, Nos. 3 and 6 ; British
Museum, No. 2 ; H. P. Manus, No. 6; G. W. Saunders, No. 7; H. Kohler,
No. 12, and in my own collection Nos. 10 and n, a total of nine stamps. As you
will see, at least two sheets must have existed as two copies of No. 6 are known.
During those ten years the is. plate seems to have met with some mishap,
causing the flaw or damage to the ninth stamp, which is generally known as
" Cross on hill." I may mention here something regarding the two remaining
consignments of the is., both of which were undoubtedly lithographed, that of
February i5th, 1878, 100 sheets (1200 stamps) in the pale green shade, and of
November 2ist, 1878, 167 sheets (2004 stamps) in the deep green shade. The
former shows the "Cross on hill" distinctly, but in the latter, attempts were
made to " touch out " the flaw on the stone; traces of the flaw are, however,
clearly distinguishable, in some specimens more than others. You will see it
very clearly on my single copy of No. 9, dark green. You will have noticed that the
flaw still exists on the plate and is clearly defined on the black pulls.

Auction: 6020 - British West Indies - The Peter Jaffé Collection 
Lot: 1555 x Nevis 1876-78 Lithographed, perf. 15 6d. grey, a block of four [8-9/11-12] with sheet margin at right, unused without gum; a few split perfs at top otherwise fine. S.G. 19, £800. Photo Estimate £ 200-250 Sold for £16
}

I have been unable to discover more than one transfer of the lithographed
shillings in either shade as I lack the material, but the " touching out " of the
flaw varies in the dark green shade, which suggests that this value was printed,
like the penny, in four panes of 12, and in the pale green single copies show
varieties of transfer flaws which I am unable at present to say are constant.
