\chapter{Key Type Issues}

The true ‘Key Type’ was first produced by De La Rue in 1879. In 1855 De La Rue had been 
awarded the printing contract for producing, by means of a quick and cheap method, Great Britain  stamps using typography (surface printing). In the same period, stamps were also supplied by  Perkins Bacon using recess printing, a much more costly process, although giving a much better  result from an aesthetic point of view. 

Some 25 years later, De La Rue turned their skills to produce stamps for the colonies. Three ‘Key Types’ with the same taste and style, but slightly different designs, were produced during Queen Victoria’s reign. Nevis used only the first of these2
 
\begin{enumerate} 

  \item Key Plate 1, the ‘Colonial’ type (1879). 
 
   \item Key Plate 2, known as ‘Postage & Revenue’ (1889). 

  \item Key Plate 3, known as ‘Postage Postage’ (1890). 
 
\end{enumerate}

Prompted by the UPU conventions, the ‘Uniform Key Type’ system developed as a mechanism for  the economical production of stamps which could be used for different colonies. De La Rue  invented an ingenious method whereby stamps of the same basic design were printed in two  different stages. A common printing plate containing only the Queen’s portrait with a blank country  name and value tablets (the ‘Key Plate’) was used for every printing. A second plate, showing only  the name of the relevant colony and the value (the ‘Duty Plate’), was used for each separate denomination for each colony.

Since the stamps had to be produced in two different passages, exactly placing the duty plate and matching the colour of the ink, the registration required a very high standard of accuracy. It is astonishing how the watermark was perfectly placed in the centre of the stamp and how the perforations hardly ever intrude into the design. 
 
When several of his territories applied to join the UPU, the Auditor General of the Leeward Islands wrote a letter, dated 15 May 1879, to the Colonial Secretary.\sidenote{Easton J., \textit{The De La Rue history of British and foreign postage stamps, 1855 to 1901}, Faber & Faber, London 
1958, p. 331} The text includes the following interesting passages: 

\begin{blockquote}

“ … It will therefore be necessary to provide 4d stamps for Antigua, St. Kitts, Dominica and 
Montserrat. Nevis and Virgin Islands have already stamps of the denomination, and for all the 
Presidencies Stamps for 2 1/2d and a sufficient number of Post Cards will also be required for 
each Presidency…..It will I presume be necessary to have the sanction of the Post-Master-General 
for the use of the new Stamps…..I enclose a requisition for Stamps mentioned above estimated to 
be sufficient for six months. In making the estimate I have been guided by the number of letters 
passing through the Antigua Post Office as furnished by Mr. Gray…..I beg to mention that the dies 
of the Postage Stamps for the several Presidencies at present in use are in the custody of the 
Crown Agents, except those of Nevis, which are in the hands of Nissen and Parker Stationers & c. 
of London” 
. 
\end{blockquote}

Just one day after the letter of the Auditor General we have the following Requisition:\sidenote{\textit{Ibid}, p. 332} 
 
Requisition No. 896 of 16 May 1879 for Adhesive Stamps, Antigua, Nevis, Montserrat & Virgin  Islands.

The first British West Indies Colonies to be admitted from July 1st were, in addition to Nevis,  Antigua, Montserrat, Virgin Islands, St. Kitts and Dominica. The proposed new rates were to be 4d per ½ oz (or 15 grams) for letters, 2½d for a packet not exceeding 4 ounces of commercial papers and a fixed registration fee of 2d, for both letters and packets.

The first stamp printed for Nevis was the 2½d red-brown with a printing of 780 only, invoiced on 7 
November 1879. As we have seen in the letter of the Auditor General of the Leeward Islands, this 
quantity was estimated to suffice for six months, less than 5 per day 6
. The next consignment of 
1620 of that stamp was delivered at the end of May 1880, six months later, as a two years 
provision. Another consignment of the same denomination was despatched on 10 August 1882, 
1080 stamps printed on a paper with the new ‘Crown CA’ watermark.

\section{Design}
How were these particularly interesting stamps produced? As a rule a stamp is born from a first 
idea and many sketches. Finally, an artist’s hand painted proof, like that one dated 12 June 1879 (Figure 1 – front cover), was prepared and the definitive design given to the engraver. Joubert de  la Ferté engraved the Queen’s head and the surrounding design; he had also prepared a first essay of that design many years before, in 1859 7. 


\section{The Die }

A ‘Die’ was first prepared for the production of the Key Forme. This was expensive, costing £ 50,  nearly £ 2,500 in today’s prices. The die is the original engraved piece of metal, usually steel, or other material from which reproductions are taken to form the plate or stone from which stamps are printed. The expressions Die I, Die II, etc. are used to denote the first and subsequent states of the same basic die. Frequently the later plates are characterised by slight alterations or retouches in the original die or a replica of it. Die I, Die II, etc. are also used to designate the stamps printed 
from plates produced from the above. In the plates it is possible to find ‘Die Flaws’, which are blemishes or unusual marks, present on every stamp reproduced from that die. These can be used to recognise the different dies. 

Master die proofs printed on glazed cardboard, 94 x 61 mm, exist in three states (Figure 2). The 
first, with black tablets, is dated 23 July 1879. A second, endorsed ‘BEFORE HARDENING’, is 
dated 25 July 1879 and a third, endorsed ‘AFTER HARDENING’, is dated 29 July 1879. Both the 
latter show cleared tablets. As these proofs are dated 23, 25 and 29 July 1879, and the ‘Day Book’ 
entries of 7 November show separate invoices for each colony, the process to produce these 
stamps went on for nearly four months. The first die (Die I) produced Plate numbers 1 and 2. 

Master die proofs struck from Die II are known dated 18 November 1890, endorsed ‘Before 
Hardening’. This die produced plates 3 and 4. 

The peculiar characteristics of each die, as described in the Stanley Gibbons catalogues, are the 
following (the most easily recognisable ones in italics): 

\subsection{DIE I}

1 - The ball of decoration on the second point of the crown appears as a dark mass of lines. 

2 - Dark vertical shading separates the front hair from the bun. 

3 - The vertical line of colour outlining the front of the throat stops at the sixth line of shading on the neck. 

4 - The white space in the coil of the hair above the curl is roughly the shape of a pin’s head. 

\subsection{DIE II} 

1 - There are very few lines of colour in the ball and in appears almost white. 

2 - A white vertical strand of hair appears in place of the dark shading. 

3 - The line stops at the eighth line of shading on the neck. 

4 - The white space is oblong, with a line of colour partially dividing it at the left end

\subsection{Key Plate} 

The printing plate used to print the general design remained the same for the whole series. It did  not bear any individual lettering and value. A small number of stamps on gummed CA paper, from unfinished printed sheets, are known in shades similar to the issued colours and perforated 12 or 14. 
 
\subsection{Plate}

The actual plate, of whatever material or construction, from which stamps are printed. When stamps using the same basic die were printed from two or more plates, showing slight differences of detail or arrangement, it is customary to refer to such stamps as having been printed from Plate 1, Plate 2, etc. An important distinction between the plates was that Key Plate 1 contained a single pane of 60 stamps only (Figure 3) whereas Plates 2, 3 and 4 contained two panes of 60 (6x10), printing at each passage 120 incomplete stamps. 
 
\subsection{Plate Numbers} 
Numbers inserted in the plate margins, or selvedge, from which stamps are printed, indicating the order in which the plates for those particular values were made. In Plate 1 the figure ‘1’ is inserted in a solid colour circle just over positions 2 and 5 and below positions 56 and 59. In Plate 2 the figure ‘2’ is also inserted in a solid colour circle, but only over position 2 and under position 56 in the left pane and over position 5 and below position 59 in the right pane (Figures 4 and 5).

\subsection{Key Plate Flaws}


Plate Flaws are blemishes, or unusual marks, that are present on 
some stamps in a fixed position on the Key plate. The variety ‘Top 
left triangle detached’ also known as the ‘Thompson flaw’ 8
 is found 
on the right pane of the sheet of 120 of Plate 2 only (Figure 6). Plate 
2 was first put into use from the end of 1884 9
. This flaw is found on 
all the other colonial stamps printed with that plate. On Nevis 
stamps the ‘Thompson flaw’ can be found on the following stamps: 
Nevis stamps Number printed despatches ‘Thompson’ flaw 
½d dull green 16,020 2 133 or 134 
1d carmine 25,740 3 214 or 215 
2 ½ ultramarine 3,000 1 25 
4d grey 16,080 2 134 
6d chestnut 5,100 1 42 or 43 
1s violet 2,040 1 17 

When Nevis stamps were withdrawn in 1890, there were in hand at the Post Office a lot of 
remainders, among which were the complete last printing of the ½d and 2½d stamps, and almost the whole of the last printing of the 6d stamp. The Crown Agents sold the remainders to T. H. Thompson in 1892\sidenote{This is not the person who discovered the flaw.}. The quantities were first given in ‘The London Philatelist’ Vol. 2, 1893, p. 112., and by Melville in his Nevis booklet. This allows us to make an estimate of the number of mint stamps that can be on the philatelic market, but for used stamps one can only guess from the sheets sold over the counter. The same calculations can be made for Antigua, Montserrat, St. Lucia and the Virgin Islands. 

The 2½d ultramarine remainders included also 2,045 Plate I stamps

\subsection{Die I, Plate 1. Manufactured in November 1879} 

1 pane of 60 stamps, no ‘Thompson flaw’, ‘Damaged I in Nevis’ occurs on 1d stamp only on 
position 5, row 10. 
 
Plate 1 was used to print the following Nevis stamps (in brackets the printing):

• ½d dull green (SG25), wmk. CA, printings of November 1883 (10,140), May and August 1884 
(9,900 and 19,920) 
 
\subsection{Die I, Plate 2. In use by January 1886 (?) discontinued mid November 1890} 

2 panes of 120 stamps, ‘Thompson flaw’ occurs in the right pane only, position 3, row 3. ‘Damaged I in Nevis’ again occurs in 1d stamps, in both panes, position 5, row 10. 
 
• ½d dull green (SG25) wmk. CA, printings of May 1888 (10,020) and March 1890 (6,000) 

• 1d carmine (SG27) wmk. CA, printings of May 1887 (9,720), May 1888 (10,020) and March

• 1s violet (SG34) wmk. CA, printing of March 1890 (2,040) 
 
 
On 15 October 1890 De La Rue asked for permission to renew the Key Plates invoiced in 1879 
(Plate 1) and 1885/1886 (Plate 2), because 61,519 impressions had been taken and there were signs of wear. The new plates (3 and 4) were invoiced 21 January 1891 and the cost was divided between Cyprus (£7. 1. 8.), St. Lucia (£3. 10. 10.), Zululand (£3. 10. 10.), Nevis (£3. 10. 10.) and Montserrat (£3. 10. 10.). Although Nevis and Montserrat paid for these plates none of their stamps were printed from them as their stamps were superseded from October 1890 by the new Leeward Island unified type. Also the inclusion, in the invoice, of Zululand appears to be an error for Natal. On the contrary, the colony of Turks Islands was not included in the invoice although it continued to use the General Key Plate 12. 

\subsection{Die II, produced end of November 1890 / January 1891.} 

The plates used are 3 and 4. The ‘Thompson flaw’ is not present. No Nevis stamps were printed with these two plates. 

\section{Watermarked Paper} 

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../nevis/crown-ca-paper.jpg}
\caption{Crown CA paper, introduced from mid 1881.}
\end{marginfigure}
Key Plate colonial stamps were printed on watermarked paper, at first showing a Crown and letters CC (for Crown Colony) arranged so that they appeared in each stamp. From mid 
1881 the letters were changed to CA (Crown Agents) (Figure 9), arranged exactly in the same way. The watermarked pattern was divided in four panes each one enclosed in a single line frame, with marginal inscriptions. Before printing, the large watermarked sheet of paper was gummed and split according to the size of the Key Plate in use. 

Finally we can conclude that the stamps were printed as 
follows: 
 
\section{A - Using ‘Plate 1’} 

1 A large sheet of watermarked paper containing 240 ‘Crowns’, previously gummed, was 
divided into four smaller sheets. 

2 The watermarked paper containing 60 ‘Crowns’ was at first printed with the Key Plate 
showing the Queen head, blank tablets and the number of the Plate, 1, inserted in a solid 
colour circle printed four times, two at the top and two at the bottom of the sheet. 

3 When dry, each sheet was passed trough the press again to receive 60 impressions of 
the duty plate, in the identical colour. 

4 The sheet was subsequently perforated. 

\section{B - Using ‘Plate 2’} 

1 A large sheet of watermarked paper containing 240 ‘Crowns’, previously gummed, was 
divided horizontally into two parts. 

2 The watermarked paper containing 120 ‘Crowns’ was at first printed with the Key Plate 
showing the Queen head, blank tablets and the Plate number 2, inserted in four solid 
colour circles placed on the four corners of the sheet 13
. 

3 When dry, the sheet was halved and overprinted, in the same colour, with the ‘Duty Plate’ containing 60 colonies names and denominations. In this way two slightly different sheets were produced, one with the plate number at right the other at left. The ‘Thompson’ Plate flaw was evident only on the right sheet, the ‘Damaged I in Nevis’ on both sheets.

4 The sheet, as before, was then perforated.
