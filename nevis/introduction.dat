\chapter{Nevis}

Nevis, a British colony in the Leeward Islands, began using stamps in 1861. Between 1890 and 1903 it used the stamps of Leeward Islands. Between 1903 and June 1980 it used the stamps of St. Kitts Nevis (S:t Christopher Nevis Anguilla from 1952) and Leeward Islands (until 1956). However, although Nevis island still remained part of the nation of St. Kitts Nevis, in June 1980 a separate postal administration was established on the island and it began producing its own sets of Nevis stamps

GENERAL POST OFFICE 
 
March 14th, 1788. 
 
In compliance with the unanimous request of a meeting of West India 
Merchants in the City of London, the following alteration will be made in the 
plan which has been recently adopted for dispatching the Packets to the West 
Indies, and will be carried into effect till further notice. 
A Mail will be made up at this Office on the First Wednesday in every 
month for Jamaica, and also for the Leeward Islands, with which a Packet will 
be dispatched immediately from Falmouth, to touch at Barbadoes on her 
outward-bound passage, and leave there the Letters for all the Leeward Islands, 
and then proceed directly to Jamaica, from whence she is to return, after 
staying fourteen days, and no more, by the windward passage to England. 

Another Mail will be made up for the Leeward Islands on the Third 
Wednesday in every month, with which a Packet will proceed, first to 
Barbadoes, and from thence to St. Vincent's, Grenada, Dominica, Antigua, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitt's, and Tortola; and after having staid no longer than 
forty-eight hours at Barbadoes, St. Vincent's, Grenada, Dominica, Antigua, and 
St. Kitt's, and twenty-four hours at each of the other islands, she is to return 
directly to England with the Letters she may have collected for Great Britain 
and Ireland. 

All Letters for the Leeward Islands, which may be sent by the Jamaica 
Packet on the First Wednesday in every month, will be conveyed from 
Barbados, either by the Government vessels of the respective Islands, or by a 
Brig to be specially employed for that purpose, in order that answers may be 
prepared against the arrival of the Leeward Islands Packet from hence, of the 
Third Wednesday in every month. 

By command of the Postmaster-General, 

ANTHONY TODD, Secretary.
