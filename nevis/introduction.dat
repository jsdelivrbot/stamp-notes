\chapter{Nevis}

Nevis, a British colony in the Leeward Islands, began using stamps in 1861. 
Between 1903 and June 1980 it used the stamps of St. Kitts Nevis. However, 
although Nevis island still remained part of the nation of St. Kitts Nevis, 
in June 1980 a separate postal administration was established 
on the island and it began producing its own sets of Nevis stamps.
