It is reported that stamps of the denomination of 1d., 4d., 6d. and 1s. were
introduced into the colony under the administration of Mr. Musgrave in 1861,
but I have been unable, so far, to ascertain the exact date of issue, nor can I find
any reference in the Records of Nevis at Chancery Lane of any requisition for the
stamps. The order for their manufacture was given to Messrs. Nissen & Parker,
who provided four steel plates, of id. 4d., 6d., and is. denominations, each of
which consisted of twelve separately engraved similar designs (3X4). It is not
recorded who the engraver was, but it is considered a wonderful piece of work,
with very little difference in the engraving, but such variations as there are
enable one easily to reconstruct the twelve subjects.

In the Stamp Collector's Magazine of January ist, 1867, it is recorded that a
communication was received from Mr. J. B. Brown, the Postmaster of Nevis,
that: " The device on the Nevis postage stamps is a fac-simile of the great seal
of the colony, and represents, issuing out of the side of a hill, a stream of water,
which, falling to the ground, forms a pool, wherein which a sick female is reclining,
supported with one hand by a companion, who extends the other to the presiding
genius, or nymph of the stream, for a bowl which the latter is rilling from a
pitcher of water drawn from the stream."

The frame designs of the four values were, as you may already know, adopted
from the identical values then current in Great Britain.
In the Philatelic Record,Vol. XXVIII, 1906, p. 7, B. T. K. Smith writes : " The
Stamp Collector's Magazine (1867, V, p. 12) mentions the existence of ' proofs
of the die, before it was finally approved or finished in its present state ' which
' are of the highest degree of rarity.' As no ' die ' existed, there could have been
no die-proofs in the strict sense of the word, so the real nature of these impressions
is not quite evident." I am, however, showing you a specimen in black on thin
paper of the unfinished one penny plate, it is No. 9. His Majesty the King possesses
a similar copy, No. 6 on the plate which is on card. You will notice that
the stars are incomplete

According to this Society's work, " Proofs of all the values exist on thick white
card, in black, purple, ultramarine, blue-green, carmine, orange, and dark blue."
D. Mackenzie in the Stamp News Annual, 1893, says that " proofs of all the
values of the 1861 issue exist on thick white card and also on thin wove
paper.

B. T. K. Smith in the Philatelic Record, Vol. XXVII, p. 7, states, " The plates
are no longer in evidence, having been destroyed."

I am showing you most of the proofs mentioned, several in complete sheets,
and would like to thank our President for the loan of two interesting items for
my display this evening, viz. 6d. deep slate on card, and the id,jleep rose partly
overprinted in blue with " SPECIMEN " and " NISSEN & PARKER." The 4d., 6d.,
and is. exist in the Royal collection. The latter similarly overprinted in complete
panes, are mentioned by E. L. Pemberton in his manuscript diary, now in the
possession of the Society, before 1878, the year of his death.

With regard to the assertion that the plates were destroyed, I am pleased
to tell you that such is not the case. Our friend, Mr. Louis E. Bradbury, is the
fortunate possessor of the four original plates and has lent them for my display
this evening. Mr. Bradbury states that they were recently discovered together
with their original wrappings, on which were printed or to which pulls were
attached. The plates were handed over by him to Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. to
be cleaned, fifty pulls of each in black taken by them, and the plates then cancelled
as you will see them now. I am passing them round for your inspection together
with the wrappings and a specimen pull of each of the four values. Photographs
are also shown you of the plates as originally discovered, and in their present
condition. Mr. Bradbury may have something further to tell you about this
matter later on. I want to draw your attention to the so-called " cross on the
hill," on No. 9 of the 1s. Plate, and to the condition of the pull from the one
penny Plate, as I shall refer to them later.

The 1s. stamps were issued to prepay postage to England, and with a
6d., 4d., or id. stamp, as the case might be, in transit through England : on heavy
letters inter-colonially, and on book packets.
6d. to prepay registration fee on letters, the postage on books over 8 oz.
and under 12 oz., etc,
4d. to prepay postage on letters inter-colonially, and to America.
id. to prepay postage on newspapers, prices-current, soldiers' and seamen's
letters, and books under 4 oz.

The four values first appeared on plain, wove, unwatermarked paper. (I
have some engraved proof-sheets watermarked with the papermaker's name,
A. Cowan & Sons Extra Superfine, and also with A C & S in a monogram.) I am
showing a used copy of the issued engraved fourpence with a section of the
monogram watermark. 

The four values were printed from the engraved plates,
and first perforated 13 ; some specimens are recorded on blued paper, but I consider
this due to chemical action, as this blueing appears mostly in patches.
