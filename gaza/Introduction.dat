\chapter{Gaza}  


After Gaza split from the West bank government in 2009 it issued its own unauthorised 'local' stamps.
When the Gaza & West Bank governments re-unified in 2014 Gaza local issues were allowed to be used on all internal Palestinian Authority mail.

Some notes about Gaza issues

Gaza items, especially FDC's, are not always of the highest quality. A wrinkled MS on an FDC is quite common...unfortunately. .

Because Stanley Gibbons list only the first stamps issued in Gaza under Palestinian Authority and Michel do not list them at all
