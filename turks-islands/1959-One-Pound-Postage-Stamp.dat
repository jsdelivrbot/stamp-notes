\chapter{1959 Queen Elizabeth II, One Pound Postage Stamp}

A \pound 1 was issued on 1 November 1960. This depicts a beautiful pelican. When it was decided to issue a pound stamp a competition was held for the best design, and this was won by Mrs S Hurd, with the local Methodists minister's wife as runner-up \cite{watts1978}. This stamp was printed by photogravure by Harrison, who were thus the fourth firm to print postage stamps for the territory.
