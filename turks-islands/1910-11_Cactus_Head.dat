\subsection{1910-20 Cactus Head Issue}

The Turks and Caicos Post Office had a special rate of one farthing for "drop letters". These were letters left to be collected at the Post Office. A \frac14d stamp was issued to satisy this need, depicting the 'Turks Head Cactus' or \textit{Melocactus Communis.} The colour varied with numerous printings from rosy mauve to rose-red and are difficult to identify especially the rosy-mauve stamps as they apparently give an aniline reaction under a quartz lamp.

Issue. SG 115-116 (Scott 23-24).}

The stamps were recess printed by De La Rue and Co. The watermark 
is Multiple Crown Ca and the perforation 13.7 x 14. 

They were first issued on 10.7.1910. Covers are very scarce.
