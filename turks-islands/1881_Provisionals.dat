\chapter{1881 Provisionals}  
On January 1st, 1881, the Turks Islands joined the Postal Union, and
three new values of stamps (|d., 2jd., and 46.) were required to prepay the
reduced rates of postage; but as the new stamps printed by Messrs, De La
Rue and Co. only reached the Islands, the 4d. in Sept., 1881, and the |d. and
2id. at the end of the year, a local surcharging had to be resorted to.
In the Philatelic Record for 1881 we find these surcharges chronicled in
the following order:

In March. £d. on 6d., black ; 2|d. on 6d., black ; 4d. on 6d., black.

In May. fd. on is., plum ; \&. on is., blue.

In June. 1/2d. on 1d., red ; 2 1/2d. on is., plum ; 4d. on is., plum.

In August. New settings of Jd. on id., red ; 2 1/2 d. on 1s., plum, in numerous varieties.

In October. 4d. on id., red.

The 2 1/2 d. on id., red, is only noted in 1884, and the 2|d. on is., blue, is
omitted altogether. 

On turning to M. Moens' Catalogue, we find the following dates given :
January, 1881. Issues with surcharge in thin numerals.

July, 1881. Issues with surcharge in thick numerals.

We may, therefore, safely conclude that the new settings spoken of in the
Philatelic Record for August are those in fifteen varieties, issued in July;
and that all the surcharges issued before that month are in the smaller
numerals.

Let us take each value separately, beginning with the Jd.
From the large number of different settings that are found it seems
probable that only small quantities were printed from time to time, as
required, and that at each printing the types were set up anew, though the
same numerals were often used.

The principal differences are in the shape of the figure 1 (horizontal top
stroke, slanting top stroke, and broken top), the length of the fractional line,
and the relative position of the 1 and 2.

The Turks Islands stamps were printed in sheets of thirty, in three
horizontal rows of ten.
It is difficult to say which was the first setting up. I place setting A first,
as being the only one of which I have not seen larger blocks, and which I
therefore look upon as being the rarest; but it is quite possible that setting
B may be the first, and that setting A may only have been issued after
setting D, and just before the change in the size of the surcharging plates
was made.

I am at present unable to say of how many varieties setting A was
composed, but it seems likely that this surcharge was printed in blocks of six
(two vertical rows of three). Sheets of the 4d. are known surcharged in this
manner, as we shall see when speaking of this value, and I have a horizontal
pair of the Jd. showing two types of surcharge (Illustration i), which seems
to point to this printing of the Jd. surcharge having been set up in the same
manner.

All the other surcharges in small numerals were printed in blocks of three
(one vertical row), as can be easily seen by examining blocks or entire sheets,
which are not uncommon. (Illustration 2 and 3.)

Take Illustration 2 for example. The distance between the I's on the
first and second stamps is not the same as that between any other two in the
first horizontal row; and supposing the setting to have been composed of
thirty types, it would be impossible that in all the first row the I's should
have horizontal top strokes, all the second row a dot for a fractional line,
and all the third row slanting fractional lines, and I's with broken tops.
We now come to the issues of July, 1881. It seems probable that these
provisional stamps still being required after six months' service, and the
surcharging process slow, it was found necessary to make up new settings of
fifteen varieties, so as to cover the sheet in two printings. There are two
distinct settings which are easily distinguished at first sight by the third line,
which in one is composed of thick numerals, like the first two lines; and in
the other is composed of thin numerals.

As it is impossible to describe accurately the varieties, I will give here
a list of the surcharges I have seen, referring you "to the accompanying
illustrations to distinguish the types.

January to June, 1881.

Setting A, on 6d., black ; 6 (?) varieties. Illustration I.

„ B, on 6d., black; 3 varieties. „ 2, 5.

„ B, on is., blue; 3 varieties. „ 2,5.

Same as C or Ci, but no fractional line to variety I.

Setting C3, on id., red ; 3 varieties. Illustration 9.

Same as C2, but numerals in variety I are in a straight line, and a short
fractional line is inserted.

Setting D, on id., red; 3 varieties. Illustration 10.

Setting D, on is., plum ; 3 varieties. „ 10.

July to December, 1881.

Setting E, on id , red ; 15 varieties. Illustration II.

„ F, on id., red; 15 varieties.  12.

„ F, on is., plum ; 15 varieties. ,, 12.

To make the 2 1/2d. stamps the Jd. provisionals were used by printing a 2
in front of the fraction; either a large thin 2, 8 mm. in height, and with a
curly tail, or a smaller and thicker 2, 6 mm. in height, and with a straight tail.

The d. settings used were the following:

Setting A, on 6d., black ; 6 (?) varieties ; large curly-tailed 2. Illustration 13.

B, on 6d., black ; 3 varieties „ „

B, on 6d., black ; 3 varieties ; small thick 2, with straight tail

Of this last setting on the 1s., prune, I have type 6, with large, curly tailed
2 (illustration 19), but I cannot say whether one or two of these

were introduced in the setting up, or if there is a whole plate of them.

In these settings, E and F, the large 2's were printed in blocks of fifteen,
or perhaps thirty; for though the position of the large 2 varies on different
specimens, being sometimes above and sometimes below the fractional line,
it is in the same position on the stamps from the same sheet.

In the Philatelic Record for April, 1881, is noted a 2 1/2 d. surcharge on
6d., black, with smaller surcharge. The large surcharges having only been
issued three months later, I think this must refer to a variety which was
shown me last year by one of our leading dealers, and of which I am
only able to give a poor illustration (23). The large 2 is the usual one
with curly tail, but the  is in much smaller figures, the fraction being
only 7 mm. in height. This variety is extremely rare, and was probably
amongst the first issued.

Of the 4d. surcharge there are several varieties (illustration 20, a, b, c, d),
and at least three different settings. One setting is printed in blocks of
six, composed of five types a, and one type b (illustration 21),

a. a.

a. a.

a. b.

so that the first two horizontal rows of the sheet all have surcharge a,
and the last row alternately a and b.

Another setting, of which I have seen entire sheets, is printed in
vertical strips of three, all type a (illustration 22). These two settings
occur, the first on the 6d., black, and is., prune, and the second on the
6d., black, only.

There is a third setting, which occurs on the id., red, and 6d., black,
containing types a and c, but as I have seen no blocks of this surcharge
I am unable to say how it is made up.

I have placed this setting last, as it is the only one which is found on
the 1d., red, which was the last surcharge chronicled; but it is quite
possible it may have been the first issued, as after the notice in the
March number of the Philatelic Record of the issue of a provisional 4d.,
we find in the May number a variety of this surcharge, described as
differing by the greater squatness of the 4.

As regards surcharge d, I have it on the id., red,* and on the id., rose,
but have always looked upon it as a forgery. I mention it here hoping
to elicit further information about it.

This ends my list of these surcharges, and if it induces others to study
these interesting varieties, and to correct and complete my list of the
different settings up, the end I have in view in writing these lines will
be attained.

* Since writing the above this surcharge has been declared genuine by the Philatelic Protection
Association.

[CORRECTION.—The last two illustrations in the March number are numbered incorrectly.
B 5 should be Setting BI( No. 6.
B 6 „ „ B, No. 5.

This latter illustration is not very successful, having been touched up; the fraction line in the 2d. variety should be a mere dot, as can be seen in Illustration 2.—ED.]
