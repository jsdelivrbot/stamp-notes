##Turks Islands
### 1955 Queen Elizabeth Definitives
The QE II 5d & 8d values were only issued on 1 February 1955 and the first full QEII definitive set 
not until 25 November 1957. 

The reasons appear to have been purely financial: 1953 was a prosperous year as it saw the 
establishment of the American military bases on the main island. The Guided Missile Observer 
Station was completed in 1953, and construction of the Naval Facility at the north end of Grand 
Turk began in mid-1954. 

But the effects were short-lived: the American base, which had been constructed by a civilian 
contractor employing local labour, brought a good deal of money and full employment for some 12 
months, but then it was nearly fully shut down and the residuary employment at the Base was 
reduced to about 20 people, including women and boys. The Naval Facility was constructed almost 
entirely by a U.S. Naval Construction Battalion, although after representations had been made, 
between 20 and 30 local men were employed. 

The staple industry of the islands – salt production by solar evaporation – was already under great 
pressure and struggled on at a low ebb, salt exports being about 20% of full local capacity. In 
1954, salt work was stopped at Grand Turk and it only continued on a care-and-maintenance basis 
at South Caicos. The local salt proprietors had struck a deal in 1951 (see APPENDIX) to sell their 
interests to a Government-owned salt company in exchange for preference shares in the new 
entity and so, perhaps, were less concerned than they would have been in the past; the problem 
had become very much a financial one, and one that was now in the hands of the local 
government. 

To make matters even worse, in 1953 the Royal Netherland Steamship Company (‘K.N.S.M.’) – 
who called regularly upon the islands – changed their staffing policies so that all crew members 
were to be sourced in future from Holland. This had previously been a good source of (temporary) 
employment but once the new policy had been put in place, many islanders had to return home.

These factors combined brought a severe economic depression to the islands during 1954. 
Hence, presumably, the arrival of the 5d & 8d in early 1955. The 5d showed the mailship 
‘M.V. KIRKSONS’, belonging to R.B. Kirkconnell & Bros., which plied her way between Kingston and 
Grand Turk; the 8d’s vignette pictured ‘Flamingoes on North Caicos’ (see Figures 2, 3 & 4).

APPENDIX RE SALT INDUSTRY 
The original deal made by the Government-owned Turks Islands Salt Company (TISC) in 1951 
paid out the larger private salt proprietors one-third of an independent valuation of their properties 
in cash, with the balance of two-thirds in 5½% £1 Cumulative Preference shares; for small 
properties valued at £ 200 or less, the offer could be taken wholly in cash. 
The preference shares would be redeemable – at par – any time after 31 December 1960 until 
31 December 1980 (and if unredeemed at that date, then at 21s. per 20s. share) – but could only 
be redeemed out of the profits of the company. 
Unfortunately the TISC never did manage to make a yearly profit – so, ten years later, the 
Government made a revised redemption offer of 8s per 20s. share, payable on 31 December 1961, 
the calculation being that 8s would be equivalent to 21s by 1980 at 5% compound annual interest. 
The offer was taken up in full and so the company became wholly government owned. 
The TISC’s fortunes did not improve thereafter: an offer by an American corporation to buy the 
company in 1963 fell through, and there were not sufficient funds available for the investment 
required (notably for a deep-water harbour on South Caicos) to make the small-scale production 
economically viable against their bigger and more efficient competitors in the Bahamas. Operations 
at Grand Turk and Cockburn Harbour were finally closed – after 300 years – at the end of 1964; 
even at Salt Cay, where there is truly no alternative possible means of employment, production 
could only continue on for a few more years.
