\chapter{1893 Issue} 

The change in the colour of the Turks Islands Twopence halfpenny
was suggested by De La Rue when the first requisition since the
approval of the Postal Union colour scheme was received on July 5,1892:

\begin{quotation}
There is little confusion in this requisition as it stated that
the stamps are required to be printed in the same colour as the last
issue, viz. that of the Postal Union. The last lot of stamps printed
were in copper red, whereas the Postal Union colour is blue. With
your consent, we would propose therefore to print this supply in blue,
the more so as the 2 1/2 d. was printed in blue on the colour scheme 
submitted by us on the 25th September 1883, which scheme was
subsequently approved by the Colonial letter of the 23rd January 1884.
