1947 Series of 8 original artist's rough drawings 
by Anne Deed in the colors and designs of the 7 values of the 1948 
Centenary issue mounted on album pages. There are 2 drawings for the 3d; 
one was used for the issued 3d stamp, the other used for the issued 6d stamp 
but in a different color. A delightful and undoubtedly unique offering.
