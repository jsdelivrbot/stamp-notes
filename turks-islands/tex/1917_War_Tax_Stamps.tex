1917 (3 Jan) 1d red, type 40 'WAR TAX' opt at bottom of stamp (first printing), right marginal block of 8 (4x2) from R6-7 of a sheet on which the right column was only partially inked, causing a deliberate second application of the opt to that column only (extending into margin), fine o.g. (usual lightly toned gum). A rare and remarkable piece, with two horizontal pairs showing 'opt double in pair with normal'. Ex Frazer. Gibbons \pound750. }
