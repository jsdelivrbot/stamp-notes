\section{1867 Queen Victoria Issue, First Postage stamp}


After correspondence in 1866 between R. G. Darrell, Postmaster of Turks
Islands, and Perkins, Bacon & Co., who were then at No. 69 Fleet Street, an order
for three stamp plates, in the denominations 1d., 6d. and 1/-, was placed with
that firm, and a supply of 12,000 1/-, 12,000 6d. and 20,000 1d. stamps was
ordered.

The stamps were recess-printed in sheets of thirty-three rows of 10.
The head of Queen Victoria, after a water-colour drawing by Corbould, was
struck from the mother die engraved by C. H. Jeens for the Antigua stamps.
The plates of these values remained in use for thirty years, being handed to
Messrs. De La Rue in 1881.

I am showing a stampless cover in one of the cases. Also three die proofs of
which you have seen similar productions exhibited by Mr. Bradbury.
Further issues of the first stamps were sent to the Islands as follows :

June 1868—20,000 id. red.

June 1871—20,000 id. red.

All these stamps were perforated by the " B " machine of Messrs. Perkins,
Bacon & Co., with a gauge of 11-12.

The paper of the initial consignment was thick wove paper without watermark,
but I show one copy of the id. on comparatively thin paper.

On the sheet of 1d. stamps passed round first you will observe a blob on the

neck of the Queen. This occurs constantly on the fourth stamp of the bottom
row (No. 24) and is also shown on the De La Rue printings, together with other
minor characteristics due to some foreign matter having obtruded during the
printing of the stamps.

On the same sheet as the id. on rather thin paper is a block of 12 with part
margins.
This is followed by a strip of 3 used, and then by three copies of the 6d. mint,
including No. i on sheet.

The next item I show is the i/- value in dull blue, which was erroneously
described in the invoice-book of Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. as violet.
This is followed by a cover with four id. stamps of the first issue used. In the
bottom left-hand corner is an impression of a handstamp, used before stamps came
into use.

I next pass round three copies of the i /- used, one of which shows an interesting
indication of the trade carried on by one named George Gibbs.
