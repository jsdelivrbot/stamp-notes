\chapter{Introduction}
  
  
THESE Islands lie between 21° and 22° North latitude and 71°
and 72° West longitude.

They were discovered in 1512 by the Spanish explorer, Juan
Ponce de Leon, when on a voyage from Porto Rico, and derive
their name from a hardy cactus found there which has a'.
resemblance to a Turkish fez.

The group remained uninhabited by Europeans for 166 years after its discovery,
for it was only in 1678 that immigrants from Bermuda made the salt
ponds and worked there each year during the summer, returning with their
harvest of solar evaporisation to Bermuda in the winter, to give attention to their
agricultural interests.

After invasions by the French from Haiti and the Spaniards from San
Domingo, a treaty of peace was signed and the Islands were annexed to the
Colony of Bahamas in 1799, but in 1840 the group was separated from the Bahamas
and in 1848 constituted a separate Colony, under the Governor of Jamaica.
This plan was found to be expensive and the Islands were definitely annexed
to Jamaica on January ist, 1874, and still remain under that Government.
Salt is the sole production of importance in the Islands and is obtained by
the evaporation of sea-water. It has been the principal industry for 250 years,
and over 100,000 tons are exported annually in normal seasons.

There are also minor industries, such as cotton and sisal growing, sponge
and shark fishing.

The sponge fishing was formerly done, particularly in the Caicos group, by
means of a hook and pole, but in 1908 American capitalists introduced divers
from the Levant, equipped with divers' gear, and the locals were rather badJy
cut out by the new scheme of collection.

Since the advent of the Levantine divers, sponge plantations have come into
being, and are now developed on a large scale in the warm waters of the Bahamas
and the Gulf of Mexico.
After many experiments it was discovered that sponges can be propagated
from slips or cuttings like plants. In this way, man is enabled to harvest crops
under the sea as well as on the land.

The Turks Islands passage divided the Turks Islands from the Caicos Islands.
The area of the two groups is 169 square miles, and of this the Turks Islands
only form one-eighth.
There are post offices at :

1. Grand Turk, the capital of Turks Islands.

2. Salt Cay, Turks Islands.

3. Cockburn or East Harbour, Caicos Islands.

The Post Office was established at Grand Turk on December 11th, 1854.  nearly thirteen years before the first postage stamp of the Dependency was
issued.

There was no British Packet Agent and all letters were entrusted to the
captains of any vessels which chanced to call.

After the establishment of the Post Office, such letters were usually marked
in blue pencil, indicating amount of postage, the words " Turks Islands Ship
Letter " in two lines (by handstamp), and the date inserted with a circular handstamp.
Covers of this type are very scarce.

In front of the Post Office at Grand Turk were seven cannon, relics of the
Crimean War, three at the left and four at the right of the entrance.
In 1928, in a hurricane, the guns were washed away, but four were recovered
and two were placed on either side of the entrance, the others remaining under
the road.

I cannot vouch for the local story that when the guns were sent from England
they were ordered to be landed at Nassau, in the Bahamas, 450 miles to the
north-west, and to be sent from there by rail to Grand Turk.
There is no house-to-house delivery, for, on Grand Turk, letters are called
for at the Post Office and, in the other Islands, at the Constable's quarters.
Grand Turk is about 7 miles long and i| to 2 miles wide. Its greatest elevation
is 70 feet above sea-level.

At the northern end of the island is a lighthouse. The cable station of the
Direct West India Cable Company has been removed from the southern end to
the town. The Commissioner's residence is at the southern end of the island.
The only town on the island is Cockburn Town, on the western side, but one
seldom hears it called anything but Grand Turk.

It contains the entire population—some 1,581—and is the seat of Government
and the Headquarters of the Commissioner.
  
Many of the illustrations here have been taken from the The Charles Freeland Collection of Turks Island and Turks and Caicos, which was auctioned by the Victoria Stamp Company in November 2012. Some of these lots came up again in the market at the June 4, 2012 auction at Grosvenor.
