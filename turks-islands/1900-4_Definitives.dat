Certain values of the issue are reported to have been in concurrent use with the
Edwadian and Georgian types as lates as 1917. The last of these remainders were
eventually destroyed in 1917 together with the printing plates [Challis, pg 49].

New printings of the 1/2 d and 1d values only were introduce on 13th March 1905 
and were printed on Multiple Crown CA watermark paper. On 20th March 1908, a new 
stamp, 3d purple was added.
