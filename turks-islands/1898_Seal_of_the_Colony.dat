\chapter{Seal of the Colony Issue}  

The new century marked also the beginning of a new era in the philatelic history of the Turks and caicos Islands. The new stamps were to be inscribed Turks & Caicos Islands. The design which was common to all nine denominations, was adapted from the Seal of the Colony, showing a three mast ship lying off-shore with salt-raking in progress in the fore-ground.

The dates 1848-1900 appear on either side below the seal, whilst in the upper corners are found specimens of the 'melocactus communis', or 'Turks Head', from which the islands derive their name.

The issue was desigated by De La Rue as the "Copper Plate Issue". It was initiated in June 1898 with a request to teh Crown Agents for designs and estimates for the die with the Arms of the Colony.
