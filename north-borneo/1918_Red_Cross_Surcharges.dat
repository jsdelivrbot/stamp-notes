###North Borneo: Stamps 1918 Red Cross Surcharges 

In 1918 the current definitive stamps were surcharged and overprinted with the words "RED CROSS" or with a "+" and a new value. The stamps were sold at face value plus the additional surcharge, which went to the Red Cross Funds. Owing to the war time conditions considerable difficulty was experienced in maintaining the specification colours of the respective deniminations. The stamps were overprinted and surcharged by Waterlow & Sons.
