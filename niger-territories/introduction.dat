\chapter{Introduction}

Correspondence exists between King John II of Portugal and the King of Benin on the subject of missionaries (1481-95) and between the Sultan of Sokoto and King George IV (1823). In 1825, a few consular letters were sent from Kuka to Tripoli following a route across the sahara used by an abortive British Government expedition (1841)---Agades, Air, Ashen, Murzuck and Tripoli.

The Imperial Post Office awarded contracts from West African Mails to teh British and African steam Navigation Co. (January 29th 1852). A yearly river boat is mentioned in 1859, and since there was no post office in the area, this arrangement seems to have been maintained until the end of 1866, when the Royal Niger Company set up its own postal system, with a weekly mil boat calling at the various delta trading posts.

At first there were no adhesives stamps at Akassa office, writers using "NO STAMPS AVAILABLE---NIGER TERRITORIES" or some other similar inscription on covers.
