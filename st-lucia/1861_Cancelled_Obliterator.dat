###1860 First Issue with Cancelled Obliterator
In August _1861_ the printers, Perkins, Bacon & Co., provided six examples of each stamp in their possession to Ormond Hill (the eldest son of Rowland Hill) for members of his family. These fascinating stamps and the story behind their appearance, have been fully described by Peter Jaffé in his book "Cancelled" by Perkins Bacon. For the full story and similar "cancelled" stamps of New Zealand see [The Cancelled Obliterator](../new-zealand/The_Cancelled_Obliterator).
