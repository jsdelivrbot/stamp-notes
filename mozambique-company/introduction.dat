\chapter{Stamps and Postal history of the Mozambique Company}




\wrapleft[35%]{../mozambique-company/map.jpg}{map circa 1922}

In 1891 the Mozambique Company was chartered to administer the Manica and Sofala areas, for which they issued their own stamps until 1942.
They were followed by the Nyassa Company in 1898, whose stamps continued until 1929.


The organisation of the postal service was part of the rights and obligations of the Mozambique Company, and between 1892 and 1941 it issued postage stamps (some 280 different). 

Most of the stamps from 1918 on were recess printed in London and are colourful and exotic, and thus popular with collectors. They are not expensive. The sale of stamps (frequently cancelled to order) certainly was a welcome income for the company. From 1942 on it continued as an ordinary non-chartered company and became in 1961 a subsidiary of the Portuguese Entreposto SGPS group. Strictly speaking the present day Companhia de Mo\ccambique may be a new legal entity.
