\chapter{Stamps and Postal history of the Mozambique Company}


Most of the stamps from 1918 on were recess printed in London and are colourful and exotic, and thus popular with collectors. They are not expensive. The sale of stamps (frequently cancelled to order) certainly was a welcome income for the company. From 1942 on it continued as an ordinary non-chartered company and became in 1961 a subsidiary of the Portuguese Entreposto SGPS group. Strictly speaking the present day Companhia de Mo\ccambique may be a new legal entity.
