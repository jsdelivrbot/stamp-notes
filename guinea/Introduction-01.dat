Guinea forms a crescent by curving from its western border on the Atlantic Ocean toward the east and the south. Its northern border is shared with Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Mali, the southern one with Sierra Leone, Liberia, and C\^ote d'Ivoire. The Niger River arises in Guinea and runs eastward.


\subsection{First stamp issue}

The first stamps of independent Guinea were issued on 5 January 1959. Before that, Guinea used general French Colonies stamps, the stamps of Senegal and stamps of French West Africa.[1]
