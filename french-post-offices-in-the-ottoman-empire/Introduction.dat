## French Post Offices in the Ottoman Empire
The French post offices in the Ottoman Empire were post offices in various cities of the Ottoman Empire operated by France between 1812 and 1923. France was one of nine countries that had negotiated "Capitulations" with the Ottomans, various extraterritorial rights in exchange for trade opportunities. In the case of mail, the countries' purpose was to facilitate communication between business interests at home and agents throughout the Middle East. The system came to end with the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.


Originally, the post office used postage stamps of France, but as these were denominated in centimes and francs instead of the local piasters, early in 1885, some French stamps were surcharged in piasters, at a rate of four piasters to the franc.

In 1905, 15c stamps in Beirut were surcharged with "1 Piastre / Beyrouth".


World War I forced the closure of all the post offices on 13 October 1914. 
After the war, only the office in Istanbul reopened, operating from August 1921
to July 1923. Stamps of France were again surcharged, with values from 30 paras
to 75 piasters.
Four post offices also issued their own stamps between 1893 and 1903: 
Cavalle (present-day Kavala), Dedeagh (Dedeagatch, present-day Alexandroupoli),
Port Lagos, and Vathy (Samos).
