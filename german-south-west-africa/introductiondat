South-West Africa (Afrikaans: Suidwes-Afrika; German: Südwestafrika) was the name of what is today the Republic of Namibia.
 
German missionaries first became active in the area in the 1840es. In 1883, German businessman A.E. LÜDERITZ acquired a land concession at Angra Pequena. In 1884 the German government declared a protectorate, which at the BERLIN CONFERENCE of 1885 was extended to cover the core of what is Namibia today, leaving out the exclave of WALVISBAAI on which Britain produced an older claim. The protectorate/colony was called DEUTSCH-SÜDWESTAFRIKA (German South West Africa), with the capital at OTJIMBINGWE (1885), since 1891 at WINDHUK (founded 1890). The sparsely populated colony attracted German settlers, 3,700 by 1903, 13,000 by 1910.
In 1890, German minister of foreign affairs CAPRIVI acquired (from Britain) a stretch of land along the Angolan-Bechuana border, the Caprivi strip, to give German South West Africa access to the Zambezi river. The fact is that the German stretch of {{wi:Zambezi}} bank is far upstream, above the Victoria falls, at a river stretch which is not navigable.
In 1903, the NAMA (also referred to as Hottentots) rose in revolt, under their leader HENDRIK WITBOOI. In 1904 the HERERO REVOLT broke out. The German military crushed it mercilessly, driving the Herero into the Kalahari desert (i.e. across the border into British Bechuanaland), where ca. 80 % of them perished. Military operations continued until 1907.
DIAMONDS were found in 1908.
World War I broke out in 1914; in 1915 German South West Africa was occupied by South African forces. 
As a German colony from 1884 it was known as German South-West Africa (Deutsch-Südwestafrika). Germany had a difficult time administering the territory, which, owing to the Germans' brutal native policy, experienced many insurrections, especially those led by guerilla leader Jacob Morenga.

During World War I, in 1915, the region was taken from German control. After the war it was declared a League of Nations Mandate territory under the Treaty of Versailles, with South Africa responsible for its administration.

In 1915, during World War I, South Africa, being a member of the British Commonwealth and a former British colony, occupied the German colony of South-West Africa.

In February 1917, Mandume Ya Ndemufayo, the last king of the Kwanyama of Ovamboland from 1917 to 1998, was killed in a joint attack by South African forces for resisting South African sovereignty over his people.

On December 17, 1920, South Africa undertook administration of South-West Africa under the terms of Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and a Class C Mandate agreement by the League Council. The Class C mandate, supposed to be used for the least developed territories, gave South Africa full power of administration and legislation over the territory, but required that South Africa promote the material and moral well-being and social progress of the people.

Following the League's supersession by the United Nations in 1946, South Africa refused to surrender its earlier mandate to be replaced by a United Nations Trusteeship agreement, requiring closer international monitoring of the territory's administration. Although the South African government wanted to incorporate 'South-West Africa' into its territory, it never officially did so, although it was administered as the de facto 'fifth province', with the white minority having representation in the whites-only Parliament of South Africa.

During the 1960s, as the European powers granted independence to their colonies and trust territories in Africa, pressure mounted on South Africa to do so in Namibia, which was then South-West Africa. On the dismissal (1966) by the International Court of Justice of a complaint brought by Ethiopia and Liberia against South Africa's continued presence in the territory, the U.N. General Assembly revoked South Africa's mandate.
