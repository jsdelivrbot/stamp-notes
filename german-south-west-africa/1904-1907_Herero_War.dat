\chapter{South West Africa Herero War}

The Herero and Namaqua Genocide occurred in German South-West Africa
(modern day Namibia) from 1904 until 1907, during the scramble for Africa. 
It is thought to be the first genocide of the 20th century.[1] On January 12,
1904, the Herero people under Samuel Maharero rose in rebellion against 
German colonial rule. In August, German general Lothar von Trotha 
defeated the Herero in the Battle of Waterberg and drove 
them into the desert of Omaheke, where most of them died of thirst.

In October, the Nama also took up arms against the Germans and
were dealt with in a similar fashion. In total, between 24,000 and 65,000 Herero
(all values are estimated as being 50\% to 70\% of the total Herero population), 
and 10,000 Nama (50\% of the total Nama population) perished. 
Two characteristics of the genocide were death by starvation 
and the poisoning of wells used by the Herero and Nama populations 
that were trapped in the Namib Desert.

In 1985, the United Nations' Whitaker Report recognized Germany's 
attempt to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples of South-West
Africa as one of the earliest attempts at 
genocide in the 20th century. 
The German government apologized for the 
events in 2004.[2]

\section{Revolts}

In 1903, some of the Nama Tribes rose in revolt under the leadership 
of Hendrik Witbooi, and about 60 German settlers were killed.[3] Khoikhoi 
and Herero joined the Namas months later.

In January 1904, the Hereros revolted, led by Chief Samuel Maharero, and killed about 120 Germans, 
including women and children, and destroyed their farms. 
The rebels surrounded Okahandja and cut links to Windhoek, the colonial capital. Having few troops within the colony, 
Leutwein requested reinforcements and an experienced officer from the German capital, Berlin.[4] 
Lieutenant-General Lothar von Trotha was appointed Commander in Chief of German South-West Africa on 3 May, arriving with his force of 14,000 troops on June 11.

The civilian Leutwein was subordinate to the Colonial Department of the 
Prussian Foreign Office, which reported to Chancellor Bernhard von Blow. 
Trotha, on the other hand, reported to the military German General Staff, 
which was only subordinate to William II, German Emperor. Leutwein desired 
to defeat the most determined Herero rebels and negotiate a surrender with 
the remainder to achieve a political settlement.[5] Trotha, however, wanted
to crush native resistance.
