# Missionary Mails

In 1824, prominent evangelical Christians founded in Berlin the „Society for the Promotion of Evangelical Missions among the Heathens“ (or Berlin Mission Society). Ten years later the first missionaries were sent to South Africa, where they founded the mission station „Bethany“ among the Koranna people. In the course of the 19th century, further missions were opened throughout Southern Africa, East Africa, and in China. In 1873, the mission house in Berlin's Georgenkirchstrasse was built, which came to be known popularly as „Factory of Apostles“.
