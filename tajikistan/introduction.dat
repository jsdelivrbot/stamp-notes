# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Tajikistan


Tajikistan, officially the Republic of Tajikistan, is a mountainous landlocked country in Central Asia. Once part of the Samanid Empire, Tajikistan became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union in the 20th century, known as the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic (Tajik SSR). It became independent in 1991.
