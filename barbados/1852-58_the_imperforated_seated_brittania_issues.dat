\chapter{1852-58 The Imperforated Brittania Issues}  

The first supply of halfpenny, penny, twopenny and fourpenny stamps was 
printed by Perkins, Bacon \& Company. The design shows Britannia 
seated on a bale of merchandise, a spear in her right hand and 
her left arm supported on a shield carrying the combined crosses of 
St. George, St. Patrick and St. Andrew. A full-rigged ship is shown at
the right. The word Barbados appears in white sans-serif capital 
letters across the bottom of the stamp. There is a small square at 
each corner containing an 8-pointed star having a white dot at the centre. 
Reticulated lines join these four squares. The background of the stamp 
is made up of engine-turning.

The design used was copied from the one originally made for use in printing 
the stamps of Mauritius and was originally produced in water colours by 
Henry Corbould. It is believed to have benn engraved by Frederick Heath. 
Incidentally, Corbould was the artist responsible for the Penny Black.

The four values were all printed from one steel plate of 110 stamps 
arranged in eleven horizontal rows of ten stamps each, prepard from an 
engraved die. The paper used was hand-made from "fine rags and new pieces" 
at the RushMill, Northampton and was unwatermarked. The sheets were imperforate, 
with their four sides deckledged.

The white wove paper used varied considerably in thickness, 
three general types being distinguishable (a) soft, medium thickness; 
(b) Hard, resembling cartridge paper; (c) thin, almost pelure.
