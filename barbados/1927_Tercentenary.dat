\chapter{1927 Tercentenary}
In February 1627 the first settlers arrived in a vessel called the William & John and landed at James Town on the north western coast of Barbados, following the discovery and colonisation of the island by Capt. John Powell in 1625 (Ref. 1).

In 1926 a suggestion was made to the colonial authorities to issue a series of stamps to commemorate the tercentenary of this event. After a number of possible designs had been rejected, it was decided to issue a single stamp on the basis of a design competition, following the example of the successful competition held in 1905 to design a stamp commemorating the centenary of the death of Admiral Horatio Nelson to be issued in 1906.
A notice was inserted in the local press inviting the public to send in designs for this stamp, with the colonial postmaster stressing the need for an original design and not an adaptation of one that had been used elsewhere.

There was a remarkable response to this initiative with no less than 49 entries being submitted by the closing date, no doubt encouraged by the offer of a handsome gratuity of £10 for the winning design. Among the entries were three from British Guiana. A record of these 49 persons is in the GPO archives in Bridgetown. While the local competition was in progress, the Crown Agents were asked to invite designs from England and Bradbury Wilkinson & Co. Limited (BW) submitted at least one design. Although this design was not accepted, it seems likely that the firm’s interest was instrumental in it securing the contract to print the stamps.

None of the entries proved to be entirely satisfactory, but one which was sent in by Miss H.E. Cox, a teacher at Codrington Hill School (the Post Office Archives erroneously refer to her as being at Combermere School) provided a valuable suggestion, and this was submitted to BW who were then able to adapt it to the design finally approved for the issued stamp. This is documented in a memorandum in the Post Office File 0426 which reads, inter alia:

\begin{letter}
Specimen design submitted 19th Aug 1926: Design submitted by Bradbury Wilkinson & Co accepted and gratuity of £5 granted to Miss H. E. Cox, Combermere School, by the Ex Committee 9th Septr 1926. Indent for 1,000,000 penny stamps forwarded to C. A. 22nd Septr 1926. H. H. H. 22.9.26.” (the initials being those of Mr. H. H. Heath, the Colonial Postmaster).
\end{letter}

In contrast to the 1905 competition, where more than half a dozen hand-painted essays for the Nelson Centenary stamp are now in the hands of collectors, very few of the 1927 competition entries have survived. Around 1947 a need arose to free up space in the GPO and the Senior Postal Official took the regrettable, but understandable, decision to jettison extraneous material in Carlisle Bay. This probably included the rejected submissions, thereby depriving not only the philatelic designs of this issue have survived and these are described below.
The one design that can be firmly documented as a submission for the design competition, shown as Figure 2, was submitted by Richard Linney of Springfield, Illinois, USA, with a short letter dated 19 October 1926. This has probably only survived because it arrived after the closing date of the actual competition so may not have been in the folder with the 48 rejected designs. The GPO responded on 24 November 1926 saying “I beg to thank you for the design submitted and to inform you that a specimen has already been accepted.” Note that Linney’s design does not include King George V’s head, but Linney was probably American while Barbados, though fiercely royalist and proud of its British links at the time, had from the outset been surprisingly casual about including the monarch’s head on its stamps, preferring various emblems.

A second design (Figure 3) was offered by Harmers auction house in 1977 and subsequently by Spink in 1998 and 1999. This design has the BW insignia at the foot in small letters and seems very likely to be the design submitted by the firm in response to the Crown Agents’ invitation. While nicely balanced, it does not convey the sense of history that the eventual design does and was rejected.

The third design (Figure 4), elegantly hand-painted in shades of steel blue on thick card, has a strong resemblance to the issued stamp. It has the heads of King Charles I and King George V at either side of a few coconut palm trees with coconuts on the ground. The dates “1627" and “1927" and “ONE PENNY” appear at the base. At the top the 1d value again appears at either side in figures as well as the name “BARBADOS”. This essay first appeared in the Stanley Gibbons stock in around 1991 before being sold as Lot 48 in its 23-25 March 1993 auction, where it was described as:

“….hand-painted artist's essay in steel-blue on art board, by B.W. artist E. Jackman, the two heads prepared separately and the two pieces of scroll at foot printed and affixed”.
The artwork, the heads of the two kings in particular, is exquisite but the additions of the two hand-painted heads and the stuck-on pieces of scroll at the foot (which have indeed been printed in blue and not drawn) is puzzling.

Philip Kinns has confirmed to us that this essay was part of a portfolio that he acquired on behalf of Gibbons from the son of E. Jackman, all mounted together on large thick cards. So plainly Jackman was responsible for the artwork. Though we will never know, as he died many years ago, one wonders, however, whether he may have taken Miss Cox’s design that would have been forwarded by the Barbados GPO to BW to be copied, redrawn the heads and added the printed scrolls. If not, where is the Cox design?

No example of the accepted final design forwarded to Barbados by BW for approval has been seen by the authors, although the BW Archives released in 1986 and 1987 contained two appendix sheets of seven colour trials in shades of red. However, two photographic proofs in sepia have been seen that are a perfect match for the issued design (Figure 5).

Also surviving in the Barbados PO is the invoice from the Crown Agents dated 13 January 1927 for the printing and despatch of the 935,040 stamps [7,792 sheets of 120] eventually delivered at an overall cost of £104 1s 11d under Requisition 1857, plus documents relating to the donation of 600 stamps to delegates to the 1929 Postal Union Congress in London and to the destruction of the remainders in 1929, as described in the handbook by Bayley (Ref. 2).

As a postscript, if the basic design in Figure 4 was indeed Miss H.E. Cox’s entry in the local competition, it may seem mean to have only granted her a gratuity of £5 when £10 was originally offered. However, it must be remembered that the Government of that day was very thrifty and they must have felt that since her design needed some material amendments, then she should only be entitled to one-half of the prize. The letter to her reads:
“General Post Office, Barbados 7th October 1926: Madam, I have the honour to inform you that the Governor in Executive Committee has been pleased to grant you a gratuity of five pounds in recognition of the design for a stamp to commemorate the Tercentenary of the settlement of Barbados submitted by you, which was in its main feature similar to the design accepted. A pay voucher for this amount has been sent to the Treasury where payment will be made.”
