\chapter{Queen Victoria 1882-86 and 1892 Issues, Surface Printed}  

In 1882 the first stamps bearing the head of Queen Victoria were issued on paper having
the Crown over C.A. watermark and perforated 14. Of this issue, the 5/- value bistre, is
interesting, only 3,600 of this stamp having been printed.

By 1881, the Perkins Bacon Plates were worn out and De La Rue took the initiative
to report that the plate for the One Penny was no longer serviceable.

\begin{quotation}
We have to report that the Barbados 1d Postage printing Plate is quite worn 
out and unfit for further use seeing that with the utmost care we can only obtain
the most imperfect impressions therefrom.

On August 12th the Crown Agents asked the firm how long it would take to make
a die, and key and duty plates. De La Rue replied that they expected the works to 
take from two to four months, and eary instructions were requested `as we are 
exceedingly busy in our Engraving Department'. On October 17th the Crown Agents
forwarded a requisition from the Colony for a die, keyplate, and overprint plates
for seven duties: the Twopence halfpenny was not included.

The proposals were accepted in full on March 9th.
There was no need for a further printing from the Perkins Bacon plates, 
for the die, keyplate of 240 multiples and duty plates of 120 multiples for
all eight values were invoiced on April 14, 1882, together with supplies of
Halfpenny, One Penny, Twopence halfpenny, and Four Pence.

\section{Fourpence Change to Brown Colour}  
The change of the Barbados Fourpence from grey to brown was made
at the request of the Colony because it was considered to be too close 
to the colour of the Halfpenny. When sending this request on September 15,
1884 the Crown Agents pointed out that any alteration could only be applied to 
the Fourpence. The firm in their reply pointed out that it was not easy to 
decide what to use, because in their colour scheme for Barbados a distinct
colour has been assigned to each of the eight values. They suggested printing
the grey much lighter. To their surprise this was rejected on September 24th.
They were asked to submit something more positive. They sent proofs in three
other colours on September 6th.

On October 3rd the Crown Agents wrote asking for further specimens, suggesting
black for one and brown like the Gambia Fourpence for another. De La Rue on
a previous occassion, excused themselves from sending a black proof because 'it 
would be much more easily forged than if printed in colour'. They submitted specimens 
in the colour of the Gambia Fourpence and also in a `very dark Grey'. The Gambia
shade was accepted. The new colour was invoiced on October 24th, when 530 sheets
of 240 multiples were despached. With them went the first consignment to be printed from the
Threepence plate, which had been invoiced on April 14, 1882. Only 12 sheets of 240 multiples
were sent.
