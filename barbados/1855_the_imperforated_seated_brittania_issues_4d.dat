\chapter{Four Pence Brown} 
In 1688, the British Mail Packet service was extended to overseas ports and an Agency is stated to 
have been opened about this date in Bridgetown. The Agency was, in effect, a sub-office of the 
General Post Office, London and was operated by a Packet Agent and a Deputy Postmaster. This 
situation continued for some 163 years. 
The local Post Office Act was passed in 1851, and the island assumed responsibility for the inland 
mails. A scheme was then developed for the operation of the inland Post Office. It was not, 
however, until April 1852 that the first postage stamps were issued. 

With the passing of the 1851 Act, the Postmaster General in London naturally assumed that there 
would be no further need of the Packet Agency. However, this was not the case, and after much 
bickering the Inland Post Office and the Imperial Packet Agency were amalgamated by an Act 
passed in 1854. 
At this time, the inter-colonial packet letter rate, exclusive of the inland rate, was 4d per ½oz. The 
Inland Postmaster, therefore, ordered a supply of new (4d) stamps for the optional pre-payment of 
postage on inter-colonial packet mail.

\section{Requisition} 
The first requisition for red stamps was sent on 11 November 1854 (1). Accordingly, the order for 
50,000 stamps was invoiced on 28 December 1854. The undenominated plate, comprised of 110 
subjects arranged in 11 horizontal rows of 10 stamps, was used to print the new value. Bayley (2)
 
states that the new value, the (4d) Brownish red, SG 5 (Sc 4), was probably put on sale 
immediately after its arrival in the island, early in 1855. According to Kenton and Parsons 
(3)
 the 
stamps would have left on the „La Plata‟ departing Southampton on 2 January 1855 and arriving at 
St. Thomas on 17 January. The stamps would have then been transferred to the „Derwent‟ which 
departed St. Thomas on 18th January, arriving in Barbados on 21 January 1855

\section{Unused}
In unused condition, these stamps were virtually unknown until the Perkins Bacon remainders 
came on the market towards the end of the nineteenth century. From the printing records (4), it can 
be noted that some 20 extra sheets were printed. These additional sheets were usually called 
"waste or allowance" and should have been destroyed. However, some or all eventually found their 
way on to the market. Bayley (2), in quoting the late Charles J. Phillips, estimated that between 200 
and 1,000 stamps of these imperforate stamps, mostly printed on blue paper, have survived. 
However, no mention is made of the Crown Agents find of 1896. 

It is, perhaps, from this source that the "other varieties have come to light, some of which have been given catalogue status, while others have not." (Bayley Pg. 207). 

\section{Multiples}

The largest block of these stamps that we have been able to trace is the one illustrated in the 
Bayley (2) handbook. This is a lovely block of 25 from the Snowden, (5)
 Bailey (6)
 and Hurlock (7)
 collections. Next is the Burrus (8)
 block of 10 (5 x 2) and the two blocks of 9, the first ex Charlton 
Henry (9), Amundsen (10). and the second ex Messenger (11), Hackmey (16)
 and de Silva (18)
. The 
other blocks larger than four we have noted are those of 8 (2x 4) 
from the Praportchetovitch (19) collection, 6 (3 x 2) from the 
Benwell (12)collection and the one illustrated in Figure 1.

\section{Plate Varieties}

The two varieties recorded on this plate are: (a) Patch on Sail 
(Position 104) and (b) Gash in Throat (Position 109). Variety (a) 
appears on the Messenger block cited above, and in Figure 2, 
while Variety (b) is shown in Figure 3. The illustrations of the 
flaws are reproduced from an earlier article in the British 
Caribbean Philatelic Journal (BCPJ) 
(13)
 

\section{Used}

The used examples normally encountered bear the G.P.O. numeral 1 cancel. However, in all 
probability supplies of the stamp were sent to the other parish post offices. Their use from these offices appears to have been very limited, as any examples bearing the parish Type C 1 cancel (14) are rare. To date, we have noted stamps cancelled from only the following parishes: #3 (St. Philip), 5 (St. John), #6 (St. Joseph), # 7 (St. James) and # 10 (St. Peter). Of these, perhaps two 
examples are known from St. James, two from St. John and the others are all solitary examples. 
The St. Peter example is shown in Figure 4. In an effort to expand the listing of the parish cancels, 
we invite feedback from readers who may have hitherto unrecorded numbers in their collections. 

\section{Multiples}

Used pairs are exceedingly rare (see below) and we have, so far, not recorded a strip or block. 
Once again we invite feedback from readers. 


\section{White Paper Variety}
In the Bayley (2)
 handbook on Pg. 28, attention is drawn to the existence of the (4d) printed on 
white paper. The single known used copy (Ex Snowden (5), Sir James Marshall (17)
 and Bailey (6)
 
and which carries an RPS certificate) is illustrated. 

\section{Bisected}

Also on Pg. 16, Bayley draws notice to the bisected (4d) on fragment, presumably used as a 2d 
value. Why this item should exist is anyone's guess, since there is no recorded information 
pertaining to a shortage of 1d stamps between 1855 and 1861, when the imperforate (4d) was in 
use. Bayley states simply "..... status is uncertain." 

\section{Covers} 

If the stamp, as we assume, was issued in January, 1855, it is somewhat surprising to learn that 
the earliest known date of use is 11 August 1856. This famous cover is shown in Figure 5. 
Subsequent O.H.M.S. covers recorded for Barbados, indicate that the inland (1d) in postage was 
not applied to official mail. Thus, the (4d) stamp pre-paid the inter-island packet charges. This is at 
variance with the Amundsen (10)
 catalogue description, wherein it is stated: „Lot 19 ..... the use of 
the 4d stamp, it also exemplifies the use of this stamp to pre-pay the quadruple rate of Island 
postage‟. We discussed the manuscript notations with the late Jack Arnell who was convinced that 
they are some sort of accounting markings. Two other (4d) covers without an additional stamp 
have been recorded by us. Firstly, Lot 40 in the Hart (15)
 sale shows only a 4d stamp -- clearly a 
(1d) stamp, to pre-pay the inland postage is missing from the cover. The other cover is from the 
well-known „Beckles‟ correspondence to Demerara (see below) dated 1861 and also lacks a (1d) 
stamp. This cover is new to us, but is currently for sale in a London auction without the correct 
annotation i.e. stating a stamp is missing! 
Despite the fact that only 50,000 were issued, the usage of the stamp continued for a further five 
years. Our latest recorded use on cover is dated 9 August. 1861. The next consignment of (4d) 
stamps was not invoiced until 26 September 1861. This is the Rough Perf. 14 to 16 Dull rose-red 
stamp, SG 25 (Sc 17). 
Usage of the (4d) can be divided into two distinct groups: 
Type (i) Optional and, later, compulsory pre-payment of postage on inter-colonial packet mail, 
and 
Type (ii) Compulsory pre-payment of packet charges on mail to the U.S. via St. Thomas and / or 
Havana. 
Of the covers we have recorded, the total is roughly divided equally between Types (i) and (ii). To 
date, we have not recorded the (4d) used on cover with any of the blue paper (1d)'s, SG 3/4 (Sc2, 
2a). Both of these stamps are known used on cover until 1857, so the possibility exists a new 
discovery awaits a lucky philatelist! Subsequent usage on cover can be found with the ensuing 
(1d's), thus: Imperf. (on white paper), Pin Perf., and Clean Cut. In Figure 6 (front cover), usage of 
the (4d) with an Imperf. (1d) is demonstrated - Type (ii)
