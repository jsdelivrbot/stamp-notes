This is a survey of the postage `stamps` and postal history of Barbados.
The first Europeans to arrive on the island were probably the Portuguese in about 
the year 1500. In 1605 Sir Olave Leigh[1] landed on the island and claimed it 
for King James. The first group of English settlers, about 30, arrived on 
the island in about 1624. More English settlers continued to arrive and by 
1650 some 20,000 people[2] had settled on the island. 


\section{Early Mails}

The British Post Office established a Packet Agency on the island of Barbados, 
in Bridgetown, during the reign of Charles II in 1663.[3] The Agency at first 
relied on casual ships to carry the mail. In 1702[4] Edmund Dummer started 
a monthly services from Falmouth, changing to Plymouth in 1705. 
The return trip took three to four months. The service ended in 1711 
when Dummer was made bankrupt. In the previous nine years Dummer had 
lost two packets at sea and had seven captured by the Spanish. 
In 1711 his remaining seven packets were seized by creditors 
and the service lapsed.[4] The Packet Agency again had to use 
casual ships to carry the mail until 1745 when a service, based on 
Dummer's original plans, was reintroduced by the Post Office.
Postal markings first appeared on mail from Barbados in the 1760s.[1] 
At the time the name of the colony was spelt "Barbadoes", 
this lasted till about 1850.[1] The British Post Office was responsible 
for the internal postal system until 1 August 1851 when it was handed 
over to the Barbados Legislature. The British continued to operate the 
Packet Agency, for overseas mail, till 1858.[5] So during this period, 
1851 to 1858, there were 2 separate Post Offices on the island. 

Unlike 
several other British Colonies, Barbados did not use British Stamps at 
any time.

\section{1851 Postage Rate}

Postage rates were set at one penny per half ounce. Newspapers published in 
Barbados were post-free; other printed matter was charged a halfpenny. Barbados 
was the first British Colony to have a halfpenny rate; even preceding the 
Great Britain 1870 issue.
The Packet rate for letters to Great Britain was six pence per half-ounce. 
The rate for letters to other islands in the West Indies was four pence plus 
one penny if not posted at the Post Office plus another one penny if the 
letter was delivered and not collected at the Post Office of destination.

In order to save on die costs, the stamp order for Barbados was combined with 
that of Mauritius and Trinidad. Each colony had the same 'Britannia' design 
with different wording. The design is based on a watercolour by Henry 
Corbould and it is believed to have been engraved by Frederick Heath. 
Henry Corbould provided the sketch from which the Penny Black was engraved. 
The first despatch of \halfd green and 1d blue stamps was sent on 30 December 
1851 on board the RMS Amazon; the vessel was lost at sea and failed to reach 
the island. Further supplies were sent in January and February 1852 including 
a 2d greyish slate. The local Post Office was opened on 15 April 1852 and 
these stamps went on sale the same day. The stamps did not show the denomination. 
The 2d greyish slate stamp is known bisected and used as a one-penny stamp, 
these were authorised for use during a shortage of 1d stamps between 
4 August 1854 and 21 September 1854.[5]

Sometime after January 1855 a supply of 4d red-brown 'Britannia' stamps 
were made available in the Barbados Post Office. Although at the time the 
island authorities were not responsible for external mail it would appear 
that they had decided to facilitate payment for letter going to the other 
West Indies islands.



The British Packet Agency office was amalgamated with the Barbados Post 
Office in 1858. Six pence red and one-shilling brown-black stamps were
ordered and sent to the island in October 1858. These stamps did show 
the value. Up till 1860 all the stamps were imperforate,[5] from 1860 
the stamps were supplied perforated. In 1873 two new values were supplied 
a three pence and a five shilling stamp.[5] It is believed that the purpose 
of the three-penny stamp was to pay for postage to Great Britain by vessels 
other than the regular mail packets. The five-shilling stamp was not 
intended for any special rate and was used on heavy postal packets.
There was an unexpected shortage of the one-penny stamps in March 1878. 
To remedy the situation five-shilling stamps were overprinted 1d twice 
and perforated vertically. They were printed and perforated locally by 
the West Indian Press. Post Office staff then cut off the value tablets 
from the bottom of horizontal strips of 12 surcharged five-shilling stamps. 
A total of 9,600 provisional 1d stamps were produced.
In 1874 the Barbados stamp-printing contract was terminated with 
Perkins Bacon \& Co and given to De La Rue \& Co. De La Rue \& Co made use 
of the plates handed to them to print further supplies of stamps.



\section{The Barbados Queen issues}

Halfpenny green, one-penny red, two and halfpence blue and four-penny 
grey stamps were ordered in February 1882 and were issued on 28 August 1882. 
In September 1884 the order for stamps by the island Post Office included three-penny purple and four-penny brown. An order for stamps in June 1886 included the six-penny black, one-shilling brown and a five-shilling bistre.
In July 1892 a surplus of four-penny brown stamps were overprinted HALF-PENNY. 
The printing was done by the West Indian Press.

\section{Later issues}

Current stamp catalogues list over 1,000 different stamps[5] as having 
been issued by Barbados since 1892.
Barbados attained self-government on 16 October 1961 and independence 
within the Commonwealth on 30 November 1966.[6] An independence issue 
was issued in 1966 which included stamps of the Hilton Hotel and cricketer 
Gary Sobers.

\subsection{Postal stationery}

The first items of postal stationery to be issued by the Barbados 
were postcards in 1881; registration envelopes, newspaper wrappers 
and post paid envelopes were first issued in 1882. Aerogrammes were 
first issued in 1949[7]
