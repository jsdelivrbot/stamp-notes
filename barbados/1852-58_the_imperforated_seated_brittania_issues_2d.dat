\section{Two Pence Slate, Unissued}  
Reference has already been made to the greyish-slate twopenny stamp 
issued at the same time as the other three values. There was also a 
slate-blue stamp prepared for use but not issued, quantities of which 
turned up in a large find of British Colonial stamps of this period made 
in England in 1889, and which comes in two shades, slate-blue and slate. 
These stamps can best be distinguished by their gums that on the 
greyish-slate being of an even shade, giving a uniform pale-blue 
appearance to the back of the stamp, while the gum on the latter two 
stamps shows a characteristic mottled appearance, caused mostly by 
the light-coloured portions of the design showing through. Where the 
gum has been removed, it is not easy to distinguish between these stamps.
