\chapter{1875-80 Watermark Crown CC}  
Perkins Bacon handed over their plates to the Crown Agents on
November 17, 1874. In advising the Colonial Secretary of Barbados, to whose
direct orders they have been working, they said:

\begin{quotation}
We cannot, howver refrain from expressing our regret that you have been led 
to seek elsewhere your future supply, as we know from past experience that the
Crown Agents will not only not employ us to print the plates engraved by us in the
first instance, but favour the rival plan of printing from the surface, instead 
from line engraving.' In fact De La Rue continued to print from the Perkins Bacon
plates until 1882.
