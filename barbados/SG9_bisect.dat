1855 to 1858 1 pence pale blue uncancelled Strip of Four, the bottom right copy is Bisected diagonally. Margins mostly all around, used on part of “Mercantile Intelligence” bearing partial addressing “(Ste)wars H(ill) (S)T. John(s)”. The stamps are sound but for one copy light creased. The Newspaper piece bears faults and repairs. The item includes a 2008 David Brandon Certificate of Authenticity. S.G. 9 var. £7,500, Scott 6a var. unpriced.

This example is unique outside example in the Royal Collection (single, bisected ), which is on an equal sized piece of newspaper bearing the same addressing and very similar, if not the same, handwriting. The photo copy of the Queen's example is included in the lot. The only other bisect from this early period is an example of the grayish slate on cover from the Charlton-Henry, Amundsen and Cartier collections.
