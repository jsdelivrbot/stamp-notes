#21c (SG34a) 1/ brown-black Seated Britannia, rough perf 14-16,
error, blue. Mistakenly shipped to the Colony in blue, 
the stamps were not placed on sale. A few examples were 
first defaced by a manuscript cross and then circulated 
by the Colonial Secretary. All of the examples extant, 
including this one, have had the pen cross removed. It is believed
that only 9 examples exist. A world class rarity. Unused (regummed)
and reperfed at bottom. Fine. 1987 RPS certificate. (Scott $20,000, 
SG \pound18,000).
