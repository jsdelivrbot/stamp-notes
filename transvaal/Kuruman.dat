1900 (9 July) envelope (some foxing) to England, no stamps or cancellers being available, handstamped with Crowned "distributor of stamps/kuruman" oval datestamp over-cancelled by tax-cleared London Paid arrival c.d.s. (4 .8), Carnforth arrival c.d.s. (5.8) on reverse. A most unusual cover posted on the first mail out of Kuruman after the relief. Photo 
Note: When the British re-occupied the town in June 1900 the Post Office datestamp was found to have been destroyed or stolen, the Distributor of Stamps datestamp was therefore used for a short period until a new Kuruman datestamp was received

Early surviving covers from the occupation of the town by General Warren are rare and normally as to be expected from most Soldier's letters in poor condition. The first such envelopes do not bear postage stamps, but are stamped by the only datestamp found in the deserted post office, that of the Distributor of Stamps.

During the siege of this town in British Bechuanaland Cape of Good Hope stamps were overprinted "KURUMAN BESIEGED" and the date, but they are not fully credited by philatelists as bonâ fide issues.
