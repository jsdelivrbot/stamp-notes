##Rustenburg

Rustenburg was besieged for a short period only - from early June 1900 to June 22 - when it was relieved
by Baden-Powell. On relief, there being no \textsc{V.R.I}  stamps available, the ZAR 1/2d., 2d., 2/12 d., 3d., 6d., 1s and 2s6d were overpinted \textsc{VR}
in purple with a rubber stamp, one at a time. The overprint measures 3.5 mm x 6.5 mm long. It is generally accepted
that the total number of stamps overprinted was 2640.

The overprints are much scarcer unused than used, and one must express a warning regarding the purple ink of the overprint,
as it is highly fugitive and can fade and disappear in sunlight.

One set of forgeries exists on the unauthorised reprints and includes the 4d value, which was never overprinted.
