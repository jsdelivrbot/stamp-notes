##Wolmaranstad

This was the first Z.A.R. town where British occupation issues appeared. Wolmaranstad was in the Western
Transvaal, about 140 miles from Johannesburg. They were overprinted in early June.

In spite of a hurried departure the Boers removed their post office stocks and the only stamps available were those
held privately by representaitives of Thos. Leask and Co. (about 10 pounds worth in all).

These were requisitioned at face value and the firm undertook the task of overprinting them, two at a time, with moveable rubber type, set in a hand-stamp.
Authorities differ to the colour of the ink used, blue, purple and black are all claimed; on the 2 1/2 d. alone in red there is
unanimity.
