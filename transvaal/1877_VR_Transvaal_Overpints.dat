##The V.R. TRANSVAAL OVERPRINTS


On 12 April 1877 Sir Theophilus Shepstone annexed the Transvaal to the British Crown. Shortly afterwards
the 3d, 6d and 1s ZAR stamps appeared overprinted __V.R./TRANSVAAL__ in two lines in red.

These stamps are very difficult to find in red overprints and a certificate should be sought if purchased.

The red overprints were succeeded by an identical overprint in black, which is believed to have appeared in
June. the black overprints occur on the 1d, 3d, 6d and 1s values.

The next overprint to appear was a wider setting of the letters __V.R__ and with __Transvaal__ in upper and lower case type. There are two
versions of this type one with roman and the other in italics. (SG Types 6 nd 7). Due to the resetting
sometimes the italics were intermingled with the roman. Only the 1d, 3d and 6d values received this overprint, and it was in black.

A number of varieties are known in settings, as well as overprints inverted, double omitted and on both sides. When to this are added the roulettes, imperforates and
even pin perforations - plus the 6d tete-beche-it becomes a specialists delight!
