##The One Penny Surcharge
The 1d surcharge on the 6d value is of great interest as there were six distinctive types of lettering with two varieties. namely a broken limp to the __Y__ and a
broken tail to the same letter. The surcharge occurs in both red and black. Yardley {{footnote:1}}, states he believes
the first surcharging of 18,000 stamps was in red and the later issues in black.
