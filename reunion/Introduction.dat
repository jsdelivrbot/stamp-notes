\ph[30%]{../reunion/94.jpg}{94		1	#1, 1852 15c Black on blue, without gum as issued, a most impressive mint example of this great classic rarity, in far better condition than is often found, with generous even margins all around, crisp detailed impression on light pale blue paper, although it has two small thins that are not noted on the certificate, it is still superior to most, as the majority of these stamps are quite faulty or repaired due to thin tissue paper upon which these were printed, extremely fine appearance.A desirable mint example of this rare first issue. This stamp, and the corresponding 30c value, were printed at St. Denis as there were no 15c or 30c General French Colony stamps available to fulfill the 15c and 30c local rates and the 45c rate to France. However, the stamps proved unpopular with the local population, in part because they lacked gum. Few were actually used and only a tiny number of mint examples were retained.Signed J.F. Brun and accompanied by a clear 2000 Behr certificate; ex-Gibralter (Yvert #1; \euro42,000). (Image)	 $36,000.00
