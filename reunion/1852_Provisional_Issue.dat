\ph[30%]{../reunion/94.jpg}{94		1	#1, 1852 15c Black on blue, without gum as issued, a most impressive mint example of this great classic rarity, in far better condition than is often found, with generous even margins all around, crisp detailed impression on light pale blue paper, although it has two small thins that are not noted on the certificate, it is still superior to most, as the majority of these stamps are quite faulty or repaired due to thin tissue paper upon which these were printed, extremely fine appearance.A desirable mint example of this rare first issue. This stamp, and the corresponding 30c value, were printed at St. Denis as there were no 15c or 30c General French Colony stamps available to fulfill the 15c and 30c local rates and the 45c rate to France. However, the stamps proved unpopular with the local population, in part because they lacked gum. Few were actually used and only a tiny number of mint examples were retained.Signed J.F. Brun and accompanied by a clear 2000 Behr certificate; ex-Gibralter (Yvert #1; \euro42,000). (Image)	 $36,000.00

I, without gum as issued, an extraordinarily choice single, which is unquestionably the finest mint example in existence, boasting exceptionally large and even margins on all four sides, plus its color is particularly rich and the impression is deeply etched on marvelously fresh paper that still retains its original bluing, but most remarkable of all is the fact that it is completely free of the myriad faults that plague virtually all existing copies, simply superb; a true gem for the connoisseur of classics; signed Calves and Sismondo and accompanied by their 2004 certificates; ex-Ferrary and Boker (Scott #2; $37,500.00).

III, without gum as issued, another fabulous sound mint example of this classic rarity, being in a state of preservation few others enjoy, featuring uncommonly large and even margins all around, which are quite uncharacteristic of this issue, plus its color is particularly strong and the impression detailed on wonderfully fresh paper that still retains its original bluing, entirely free of the numerous faults that are typically associated with this frail issue, extremely fine; an especially desirable example of this sought-after stamp; signed Calves (Scott #2; $37,500.00).
