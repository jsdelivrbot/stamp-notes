# Third Issue

The death of King Frederic Augustus
II on August 9th, 1854, and accession
of his brother John, made a change in
the portrait stamps necessary. As the 3
pfennige value bore the Arms of the
kingdom it was not deemed necessary
to make any change in these and they
continued to be printed by Hirschfeld.
The other values of l/2, 1, 2 and 3 neugroschen were printed by Meinhold
and Sons. Little alteration was made in the framework but in the centre
the portrait of King John superseded that of his predecessor. The profile is
shown to the left instead of to the right as on the 1851 stamps. The new stamps
were all ready by the end of 1854 but they were not placed on sale until about
August, 1855. The stamps were printed in black on colored papers as before,
but a change was made in tne size of the plates which now consisted of 100 instead
of 120 subjects. In 1856, 5 and 10 neu-groschen stamps were added to the
set as it was found desirable to have some higher values for use on letters
sent beyond the confines of the German-Austrian Postal Union. These two stamps were printed in color on white paper like the 3pf denomination. More than one plate was used for some of the values and some of these show variations in the size and shape of the
numerals in the small ovals at the sides.

These differences are particularly noticeable
in the l/2 and 1 neu-groschen. How
many plates were used altogether is not
known but when Messrs. Meinhold and
Sons lost the printing contract in 1863
they sent to the Dresden Post-office the
original dies of the six values, together
with four reliefs and five printing plates
of the ^ngr, two reliefs and five printing
plates of the Ingr, two reliefs and
three printing plates of each of the
2ngr and 5ngr, and one relief and two
printing plates of the lOngr. The
plates of the 3ngr do not appear to
have been sent at that time and no official
record of their receipt at a later
date has been found.
Shades are numerous and again I
cannot do better than quote Mr. Gray
on this subject, viz :

All the stamps of this set vary considerably
in shade, as is only to be
expected in the case of a long-lived
series. The following are the principal
variations :
principal
variations :
neu-groschen, black on pearl grey,
grey, lilac grey, jet-black
on grey.
1 neu-gr, deep rose, rose, pale rose.
2
"
blue, deep blue, greenish
blue.

neu-gr, deep yellow, yellow, pale
yellow.
5 pale red, russet brown,
red brown, vermilion.
10 blue, deep blue.
Some of the shades of the l/2 neugroschen
are much scarcer than others ;
the greenish blue shade of the 2 neugroschen
is scarce used, though common
unused, and the russet brown 5
neu-groschen is very scarce. Apparently
this color was used by mistake,
and though some of the stamps
printed in this shade were issued, the
printer was compelled to supply others
instead, printed in the proper color,
and the balance of the russet-brown
stamps were destroyed by the postal
authorities. (There were 100,000 of
these errors, of which 62,200 were
sold according to Mr. Westoby though,
as will be seen below, Mr. Gray puts
the number at 4,000 more).
The 5 neu-groschen is found on
thick and on thin paper and is also
known double printed (an uncatalogued
variety). For the first printing
of the 10 neu-groschen stamps
thinner paper was used than for the
two later printings. The quantities
printed of these stamps were as follows
:
l/2 neu-groschen, 17,705,000
1 17,345,000
2 5,980,000
3 7,880,000
5 '
(vermilion
and pale red ) , 200,000
5 ' russet brown, 66,200
5 (red brown), 823,800
10 250,000
There were twenty-four printings of
the l/2 , 1, 2 and 3 neu-groschen stamps,
one of the russet brown 5 neugroschen
and three of the 10 neugroschen.
The number of printings
of the other shades of the 5 neugroschen
seems not to be ascertainable.
