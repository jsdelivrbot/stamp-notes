# Forgeries

## First Issue

Few stamps have been so extensively
counterfeited as this 3 pfennige, one
writer alone admitting the possession of
no less than twenty-rive different counterfeits.
Mr. Westoby mentions several
points which should be of value in detecting
counterfeits, viz. :

In the ornament in the corners,
which is in the shape of a quatrefoil,
the interior design is in the shape of
a four-rayed star, or rather a round
uncolored centre to a St. Andrew's
Cross. 

In the left upper corner ornament there is a curved line opposite to each extremity of the cross. This curved line is wanting opposite the left upper extremity of the cross in all
the other corner ornaments, and also opposite the upper right extremity of
the cross in the right upper ornament, and this right extremity is long, while the left one is very short, as also is the upper right one in the right lower ornament. In the inscriptions
the S and A in SACHSEN almost join, as also do the R and E in DRIE. There is a break in the
inner line of the frame opposite the I of DRIE. These are the principal tests given by Messrs. Collin and Caiman, and in their catalogue enlarged engravings are given of the corner ornaments.
In the genuine stamps there is a full stop after FRANCO which, curiously enough, is absent in most
of the imitations.
