# Remainders

At the time Saxony joined the North
German Confederation there were large
remainders of some of the values of
the 1863 issues and smaller lots of all
values of 1856 and the 3pf of 1851.

The Government made no attempt to dispose of these in one parcel, as was
done by other German States, but offered the earlier issues at so much per
stamp and the 1863 issue at a few marks per 500 stamps. No information seems to have been published as to the numbers available but as late as 1890 all but the 10ngr were obtainable at very low figures, though the 10ngr was quoted at 15 marks. In 1899 the prices were increased and the stamps were then offered as follows :

3pf of 1851, 15 marks

1ngrof 1856, 1
"
2ngrof 1856, 2
3ngrof 1856, 3
"
Sngrof 1856, 10

None of the 1/2 and 10 neu-groschen were then available and the only value of the 1863 series offered was the l/2ngr which was quoted at 6 marks per 500 stamps.
