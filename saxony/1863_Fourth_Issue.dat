# 1863 Fourth Issue


In March, 1861, the Prussian postal administration drew the attention of the
other members of the German-Austrian Postal Union to the confusion which
existed owing to the lack of uniformity in the colors adopted for stamps of
corresponding values in the various States. It was suggested that all stamps
of similar value, whether that value was expressed in schilling, grote,
groschen or kreuzer, should be printed in the same color. These proposals met
with general approval, as we have already shown in considering the stamps of other States, and Saxony began preparations for a new issue. It had been decided to change the color of the 3ngr and 5ngr stamps to black on brown and black on yellow respectively, when the appearance of the new Prussian stamps caused Saxony to reconsider its plans. 

The new Prussian stamps, conforming to the new color scheme, were all printed in color on white paper and the Saxon postal authorities, upon investigating the matter, decided to adopt the same principle and retire the colored
papers in favor of stamps printed in color on white.

Designs for the new
series were invited from engravers but
only four firms competed Hirschfeld,
Meinhold and Sons, and Blockman and
Son, of Dresden, and Giesecke and
Devrient of Leipzig. The contract was
awarded to the last named firm and the
taille-douce process was abandoned for
the cheaper method of typography. The
design consisted of the Arms of Saxony
in colorless embossing within an upright
oval engine-turned band with a
scalloped outer edge. On the upper
part of the band the name "SACHSEN"
is shown, on the lower portion is the
denomination and in the sides and below
the Arms are oval discs containing
the numerals of value. These are in
color on a plain ground at the sides
and in white on a ground of solid color
below the Arms. The 3 pfennige and
l/2 neu-groschen values differ from the
others in being enclosed within a rectangular
frame in which the numerals of
value are again shown in each of the
spandrels.

The advent of the new issue was
notified by a circular issued from Leipzig
on June 19th, 1863, and the stamps
were placed on sale on July 1st following.
The denominations were the same
as before except that the 10 neugroschen
was omitted, owing to the
small use made of that value. Thestamps
were printed in sheets of 100
and perforation was introduced for the
first time, the gauge being 13. There
are pronounced shades of all values
and though Scott gives but two for each
denomination (three for the 5ngr).
Gibbons lists two for the 3 pfennige,
three each for the l/z t 1, 2, and 3 neugroschen,
and five for the 5 neugroschen.
Specialists extend the list
still further, especially in the case of the
two lowest values.

In 1867 complaints were made of the varying colors of the 5 neu-groschen,
and the contractors printed some in a reddish lilac shade in which there
would be fewer variations. These stamps were objected to, however, as
resembling the 1ngr too closely and they were not put on sale. Finally a greyish
shade of lilac was adopted.

## Printings
Mr. D.C. Gray tells us that the quantities
printed and number of printings were as follows : 

"There were fifteen printings of the 5 neu-groschen, sixteen of the 2
neu-groschen, and seventeen of each of the remaining values. The quantities
printed of these stamps were as follows:
 
\begin{tabular}{lr} 
3 pfennige &10,850,000 \\
1/2 neu-groschen &17,100,000\\
1 neu-groschen &15,175,000\\
2 neu-groschen &4,870,000\\
3 neu-groschen &5,870,000\\
5 neu-groschen &950,000 \\
5 neu-groschen (grey, and greylilacshades), &250,000\\
\end{tabular}

The 1 neu-groschen is known imperforate vertically, and the 3pf, l/2, 1 and 2 neu-groschen are known entirely imperforate.


The post office of Saxony was included
in the post office system of the
North German Confederation on January
1st, 1868, and the distinctive stamps
were consequently withdrawn.
