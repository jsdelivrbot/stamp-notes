# 1850 First Issue

Among all the stamps issued by the
various German States none is more
popular than the first stamp issued in
Saxony the 3 pfennige red. It is not
a very handsome stamp, or even one of
original design, but it is merely a somewhat
crude copy of the Ikr stamp issued
by Bavaria in 1849, as we have already
pointed out. This particular stamp
seems always to have been in demand
from the earliest days of stamp collecting,
the real reason of its popularity being
that it was one of the most difficult
stamps to obtain as well as one of the
first used in the German Empire. This
stamo was produced in a hurry and did
not receive the careful consideration accorded
to the other postage stamps issued
by Saxony in the following year.

The reason for its hurried manufacture
lies in the fact that it was intended for
use on newspapers and printed matter
which, under the newly formed postal
Convention between Austria and various
German States, had to be prepaid.
If not prepaid, the packages were
charged full letter rate. Not only had
these packages to be prepaid but the
Saxon Government insisted that stamps
must be used and payment in cash was
not allowed. The design consists of a
large open "3" covered with a mazework
pattern on a ground composed of
fragments of wavy lines within a frame
18 1/2 mm. square. The frame is about
3% mm. wide and is inscribed
"SACHSEN" at top, "FRANCO" at
base, "DREI" at left, and "PFENNIGE"
at right. In each of the angles
is a small ornament with a star-like
centre.

The stamps were manufactured at the
printing establishment of J. B. Hirschfeld,
a printer and lithographer of
Leipzig. The original die was engraved
in relief on metal and from this
moulds were taken in plaster, or some
similar material, from which Arnold,
the stereotyper in Hirschfeld's works,
took casts in type-metal. The stamps
are not all of equal size the variations
being due to unequal shrinkage of the
plaster moulds in drying, It is also
probable, as Mr. Westoby points out,
that Arnold, to save time, used some
of his to produce moulds for others.

It is probable only twenty moulds
were made for the stamps were
printed in sheets of twenty in four
horizontal rows of five. It has been
suggested that there was another plate
used for some of the later printings but
no satisfactory proof of this has been
produced. Lines of printer's rule were
placed between the casts and in referring
to these Mr. Westoby says they
ran "vertically down the sheet uninterruptedly;
but the horizontal lines
were broken and did not touch the
vertical lines." Unless, however, a
second plate was used, or a resetting
of the casts made, this statement must
be inaccurate for in a superb mint
block of four illustrated in a German
paper some little time ago the horizontal
lines are distinctly continuous
and it is the vertical ones which are
broken. The stamps were printed on
ordinary white wove paper and they
are, of course, not perforated. The
gum is of a distinctly yellow hue.
The first lot of stamps consisting of
120,000 (6,000 sheets) was delivered by
the end of June and the public's appreciation
of them may be gauged from
the fact that only 19,000 remained by
the 20th of August. Two days later
another supply of 60,000 was delivered.
Both these lots were ordered orally but
after that it was decreed that future
orders must be made in writing from
the office of the Main Postal Treasury.
Six further lots were ordered and delivered
as follows :

October 8th, 1850, 40,000 2,000
November 4th, 1850, 60,000 3,000
December 19th, 1850, 60,000 3,000
February 22nd, 1851, 40,000 2,000
April 3rd, 1851, 80,000 4,000
June 17th, 1851, 40,000 2,000

Altogether, therefore, 500,000 of
these stamps were printed and delivered.

One sheet of twenty stamps was sent
to the Finance Ministry at Dresden as
a sample, 463,058 stamps were sold, and
the remaining 36,922 were burnt on December
10th, 1851. In the early nineties
the sheet sent to the Treasury was apparently
cut up and the stamps sold
singly at a dollar or so apiece.
That this stamp was only intended as
a temporary issue is shown by a remark
contained in the official notification of
June 22nd, 1850, viz: "This form is,
however, only provisional, and will be
altered when postage stamps for correspondence
(letters) are introduced."

This stamp was replaced by the 3pf
green label, in the Arms type, on August
1st, 1851, and it was then decreed
that no more of the red stamps were to
be sold at the post-offices. At the same
time the public were informed they
could use any of the red stamps they
possessed but that under no circumstances
would they be exchanged for
the new green ones. Writing in the
Monthly Journal for December, 1900,
Mr. G. B. Duerst says: "This is the
reason why the 3 pfennig, red, is so rare
with the lozenge obliteration, which
was onlv introduced in March, 1852.
The usual postmark is the name and
date stamp, but the earliest obliteration
was in pen and ink."

The stamp exists in a number of
shades, doubtless owing to the many
printings, but according to the catalogue
quotations there is little to choose between
them in point of rarity.

The stamp is rare and its scarcity is accounted for by the fact that the vast
majority of the 463,058 stamps sold were
used on newspaper packages and were
destroyed in the removal of the wrapper.

Unused this stamp has always been considered scarcer than used but owingto the larger demand for used specimens of recent years there is now little to choose between used and unused so
far as market value is concerned. We believe the largest block known in mint condition, with original gum, is a block of four from the right lower corner of a sheet. An entire sheet is, or was, in existence, however. This was described in the Monthly Journal in 1896 as follows: "Mr. Castle secured, for a sum of about $1500.00, an unsevered and unused sheet of 20 Saxony 3pf red.

This is believed to be the only sheet known, and is the one formerly in the Friedl Museum of Vienn. Mr. Friedl got it from a Castle in Saxony, where it was found pasted on a fire-screen and
varnished over! Naturally it is not in the most brilliant condition, but it is a
unique piece, and well worth the price paid."

This 3pf stamp is one that has consistently shown an appreciation in value and of recent years it has jumped upwards in price at an astonishing rate. In 1864 it was worth about
35c in used condition; in 1884 it was quoted 75c; in 1894 its value had increased
to $22, in 1908 it stood at $37; while at the present time Scott has it quoted at a modest $70, Gibbons at $120,
while fine copies have approached the
$150 mark at auction abroad. 

There isa suspicion in some quarters that some
one is attempting a corner in this stamp
a not impossible proceeding in view of
the  limited number available and
should such a "corner" be successful
there is no knowing to what price this
variety may yet be forced.
