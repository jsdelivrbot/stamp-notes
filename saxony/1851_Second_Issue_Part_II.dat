## Error

By far the rarest stamp of Saxony is,
of course, the y neu-groschen printed
in error on the pale blue paper of the
2 neu-groschen. The existence of this
error seems to have been quite unknown
until Dr. Kloss published his "History
of the Stamps of the Kingdom of
Saxony" in 1883 or 1884. 

According to
Dr. Kloss "On August 22nd, 1851, the
Post-office at Leipzig informed the G.
P. O. at Dresden, that they had found
a quantity of stamps among the 2ngr
blue which had, instead of '2 Neugroschen,'
the inscription ' neugroschen'
although printed in the correct
color of the 2ngr stamps, viz., blue. 

On referring to the printers' statement it was found that only 120 stamps were
printed in this color by mistake, 63 of these were sold over the counter before
the mistake was found out, the remaining 57 were returned to the G. P. O.
at Dresden." There is little doubt that the 63 stamps which were sold to the
public, were sold as 2ngr stamps, whose
color they bore, and they were used as
such.

It appears the Post-office sold the errors
singly and in strips of ten and
when they discovered the mistake the
purchasers were written to and asked
to return the stamps as any letters
franked with them might possibly be
treated as unpaid by other offices.

When Dr. Kloss made his notes public
the hunt for the errors began and some
of the firms written to by the Leipzig
post-office in 1851 were hunted out.

This resulted in the discovery of one
of the letters written by the Post-office
with an unused strip of ten of the errors
pinned to it. Due to the forgetfulness
of a clerk this letter was never
returned to the postal authorities ! Herr
Blauhuth, of Leipzig, secured this strip,
and for ten years these were the only
copies known. 















The owner first sold a
pair, inlcuding the one spoiled by the
pin-holes, for $37.50, while his last copy
realised $300. The 57 errors which
were returned to Dresden should have
been destroyed but, in 1891, 24 of the
stamps were found in an envelope
pinned to an old document relating to
the former postal accounts in the Department
of Finance, Dresden. 

What became
of the other 33 is a mystery which
will probably never be solved most
likely they were destroyed as was
originally intended. These errors were
included in a set of so-called "essays"
put on the market by the Saxon Government
at 75c each. The history of
the error had been forgotten by the
officials but not by collectors and consequently
the sets sold like the proverbial
hot cakes. Most of these 24 errors
were single copies but in the lot was
one strip of five and one block of four,
the latter eventually passing into the
famous Mann collection. 

But though
this error is one of the great rarities
unused it is even scarcer used. There
is a pair in the Tapling collection, another
pair in a German collection, and
a few single copies are known.
