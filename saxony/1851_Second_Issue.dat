# 1851 Second Issue

Whilst the first Saxon stamp had
been designed and issued without much
care or fuss, many and deep were the
deliberations before the permanent issue
was decided upon. Various methods
of production were examined and considered;
wood engraving was objected
to, and line engraving was considered
too expensive. Numerous essays were
submitted by Hirschfeld and others and
those of Hirschfeld met with approval.
Before, however, he received the order
the firm of C. C. Meinhold and Sons, of
Dresden, a firm well known for the
production of engravings by the glyphographic
process, made a proposal
which was accepted by the authorities.

Hirschfeld's design for the neu-groschen
values was, therefore, handed to the
Meinholds and the only order Hirschfeld
received was that for printing the
3 pfennige stamps. The 3pf value was
again intended for printed matter but
it now represented the rate within the
entire German-Austrian Postal Union
this was the main reason for the
change of design for this denomination.

The 1/2 neugroschen was intended for
local letters; the 1 ngr for letters sent
less than 10 miles within the Postal
Union; the 2ngr for letters between 10
and 20 miles; and the 3ngr for letters
beyond 20 miles.

The design for the 3 pfennige shows
the Arms of Saxony on a shield surmounted
by a crown within an oval of
solid color. On a scroll at top is
"SACHSEN" and on a similar scroll at
base is "Drie Pfennige." Numerals of
value, within small circles, are shown
at the sides and the spaces are filled
with scroll ornamentation. The whole
is enclosed within a narrow rectangular
frame. This stamp was printed in
sheets of 120, the plate being composed
of casts taken in type-metal from the
original die. The stamps were placed
so closely together that specimens with
good margins are very difficult to obtain.

The neugroschen values are all alike in
design and show a profile portrait of
King Frederic Augustus II, with head
to right, on a solid colored ground within
an oval. The inscriptions are similar
to those of the 3pf except that the lower
one is "Neu-Grosch.", separated by the
numeral of value. Numerals are also
placed at the sides and all four values
were printed in sheets of 120. The
early supplies of all values were delivered
by the printers in strips of ten
for some reason or other. Usually the
sheets were sub-divided horizontally, but
in some cases the strips were cut vertically.

The 3 pfennige exists in two distinct
shades blue or dark green and yellow
green. The colors of the papers for the
various neu-groschen values also show
some variation and in dealing with this
matter I cannot do better than quote
from an excellent article in the Philatelic
Journal of Great Britain, written
by Mr. D. C. Gray in December, 1908 :
The l/2 neu-groschen may be found
on paper varying from almost white
to bluish grey, the bluish shades being
the scarcer. The paper of the 1 neugroschen
is sometimes deep and

the 3 neu-groschen varies from very
deep to quite pale yellow; while the
2 neu-groschen appears printed on
pale blue and very dark blue paper.
Some of the shades of the l
/2, 1, and 3
neu-groschen may be due to fading,
although, considering the large numbers
of printings which took place a
variation in the colour of the papers
used is not surprising. The change
of the 2 neu-groschen from pale to
very dark blue, however, was certainly
not accidental, but was due to
definite instructions given to the
printers by the postal authorities in
1852.

The reason for this order was that
a postmaster had complained to the
head office that if the 2 neu-groschen
stamps (printed in pale blue) were
much exposed to the light they faded
into approximately the color of the
l/2 neu-groschen. By the adoption of
the dark blue paper any mistakes
arising from such a cause were
entirely obviated. These stamps were
all put on sale on 29th July, and
were to frank letters from 1st August,
1851. The quantities printed
of each value of this set were as
follows :

3 pfennige, 12,500,000; l/2 neugroschen,
5,100,000; 1 neu-groschen,
5,700,000; 2 neu-groschen, light blue,
700,000; 2 neu-groschen dark blue,
1,500,000; and 3 neu-groschen,
2,350,000. 

There were twenty-four
printings of the 3 pfennige; seventeen
of the y and 1 neu-groschen, and
sixteen of the 2 and 3 neu-groschen.
