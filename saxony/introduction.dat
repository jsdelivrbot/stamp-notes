\chapter{Introduction}

Prior to the North German Confederation, German States stamps were issued by most of the separate Germanic kingdoms, duchies, free-cities, etc. of Northern Europe.

Saxony is known as Sachsen in German and Sakska in Sorbian. Both Sorbian and a Sorbian dialect of German are spoken there. Located in the southeastern part of present-day Germany, its history spans more than a millennium. It was a medieval duchy, an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire, and a kingdom until 1918. Under the Holy Roman Empire, the Elector of Saxony was also the King of Poland.

During the Austro-Prussian war, an ally of Austria at the time, Saxony was occupied by Prussia. Saxony afterward became part of the North German Confederation and subsequently fought alongside Prussia during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. In 1871, the Kingdom of Saxony joined the newly formed German Empire.
