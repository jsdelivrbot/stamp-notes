\chapter{Belarus}  
Belarus - a land of 10 million people in 206,000 square miles. 

On the break up of the USSR, Belarus declared independence in September 1991. The first stamps were issued in 1992. These stamps, both 5 roubles issued 31.8.92, show the State Arms, and the National Flag superimposed on a map of the country. 

Before Belarus had its own issues, stamps and pre-stamped stationery of the USSR continued in use. Increases in rates were shown on the envelopes by means of locally applied surcharges. Some were handstamps, others applied by machine. Probably some were adapted franking (meter) machines, and some adapted postmarks. At present I have no evidence of where the surcharges originated, other than by the reference to the postmark: some were probably done at a central office. (As stamps of Lithuania have been seen used in Moldova at this time, it is not possible to be sure about anything!) 

Note that all dates here are in UK notation (DDMMYY). 

Belarus used the postage stamps of the Soviet Union from 1917 to 1991.
In 1991 Belarus became an independent nation and began its own postal administration in 1992.
