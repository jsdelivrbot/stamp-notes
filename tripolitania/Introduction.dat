## Tripolitania
British stamps overprinted M.E.F. (Middle East Forces) were used from 1943 to 1948 after the area was captured by the British during World War II. The currency used was
the M.A.L. which is an acronym for Military Authority Lire (Libya currency).

From 1 July 1948 stamps overprinted B.M.A. TRIPOLATANIA were used.
