\chapter{1923 Propagation of Faith}    


In 1923 the first issue of the separate province of Tripolitania was the overprinted Propaganda Fide issue. One stamp of each of the 20c and 30c values in position 17 has a notable retouch behind the head of Jesus. The 50c and 1 lire stamps do not show this flaw. 25,000 sets were issued.

The 30c stamp exists imperforate in between and is listed in all major catalogues.
