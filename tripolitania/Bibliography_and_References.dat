The Edward M. Gilbert Collection of Italy - January 29, 2008

The Edward M. Gilbert Collection was an extraordinarily comprehensive, and largely mint, collection of the postage stamps of the entire Italian area, 1850 - 1940, including the Italian States, Italy, Italian offices Abroad and Colonies, San Marino and Vatican City. It is filled with an impressive range of desirable rarities, errors and varieties - with most key items having been expertized. All will be offered at unreserved public auction at Spink Shreves Galleries luxuriant offices in New York City on January 29, 2008.
