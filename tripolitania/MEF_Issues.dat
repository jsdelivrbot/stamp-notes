## Tripolitania

\figurecenter1[70%]{1396.jpg}{1943, Dec 6. Envelope from Villaggio Crispi to Garian, bearing 3d. without ''M.E.F.'' overprint, tied by rare ''Crispi/Misurata'' cds which is repeated alongside. As this issue was not sanctioned in this territory, the franking was invalidated by applying several strikes of a small mute circular handstamp along the text of the cds used to tie the franking; in spite of this, the cover was not taxed as it was sent to an Italian military man in the Red Cross collaborating with the British. Censorship and Tripoli cds on reverse. An extremely rare usage which may be considered as a postal fraud, although franking was not required, this fact may have been unknown to the sender. 
Estimate 300 &euro; }
