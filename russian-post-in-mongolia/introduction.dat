\chapter{Russian Post in Mongolia}  

A Russian consular post was established in 1860, but no examples appear to have survived.<sup>1</sup>. The regular Russian post appears to have been established
around 1870  and it had the monopoly until the Chinese post in Mongolia was established
in 1909. It was eventually handed over to the Mongolian Postal Administration in
1921. Ordinary Russian stamps were used, although sometimes one finds "Kitai"
overprints and Romanovs. the majority of the surviving mail is from the capital
Urga (now Ulan-Bator) and Kalgan.
