At the Washington Convention  of the Postal Union, held in 1908, it was decided that all stamps of a face value of 1/2d., 1d/, or 2 1/2d. or their equivalents should be green, red, and blue respectively, and changes were made throughout the Colonies to conform to this. The colours of the other denominations being the same time standardized for all the Crown Colonies. The 1/2d., 1d. and 21/2d. values appeared in the new colours in 1907. A new denomination, one farthing, for use for interinsular postage was issued on the 4th July, 1909, printed in brown. The 3d. was issued the next year printed in purple on yellow paper, and the 2d., 6d., 1s. 2s. 6d. and 5s. appeared in the new colours in 1911.

Shades may be found of those values printed in one colour, and an interesting variation of the 1d. exists in which the duty plate impression is not nearly so heavy, the letters of the words Leeward Islands being thinner and also the lines of shading in the value tablet.

The 1/2d., 1d. and 2 1/2d. of this issue are also to be found with the broken inner line to the name tablet, in the same positions on the sheet as in the last series.

Plates 1 and 2 were both employed, but to what extend has not been ascertained.
