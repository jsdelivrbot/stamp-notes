The 1/2d., 1d., 2 1/2d., 6d. and 1s. values of the Edwardian series were placed on sale on September 1st, 1902. The 2s., 3s., 2. 6d. and 5s. followed some time afterwards.

The design is similar to that for the Queen Victoria issue, except that the King's Head has a crown on top and is on a solid instead of a lined background as before. The watermark and perforations are as before. 

At the time the stamps were printed Messrs. De La Rue were working at high pressure producing similar stamps for a number of other Colonies and so it was found necessary to make two plates. These were identical as far as the designs were concerned, but differed in the make-up.

The first of these numbered (1), produced sheets of 120 stamps arranged in two panes of sixty (ten rows of six) side by side as in the Victorian series. There was a Jubilee line round each pane and four plate numbers in the margin in the positions already described. 

The second plate number (2), produced sheets of 240 stamps, arranged in four panes of 60 similar to the last.
