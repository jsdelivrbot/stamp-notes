\chapter{The Diamond Jubilee Issue}

The issue was first announced in the \textit{Leeward Islands Gazette}, dated 8th July, 1897:

\begin{letter}

\end{letter}

The whole of the then current issue was so overprinted and the overprint was made by means of a handstamp by Mr. E. D'A. Tibbits, the Chief Clerk in the Colonial Secretary's Office.
Considering that the overprinting was done by hand, it is surprizingly that very few errors can be found. Gibbons lists the halfpenny with inverted overprint.

S.G. 14,a, cat. £1,550. B.P.A. certificate (1984). The property of another vendor. Photo. Price Realised £450}

All values are found with a double impression, but this is due to side-slipping of the die whilst in the act of being applied to the stamp and not to a double strike.

The stamps that were overpinted compised both old and new stock. The half-penny has been found with the deep brown gum of the earliest printings of plate 1 and also with the white gum of plate 2. The 7d. according to Poole, all have brown gum and are from plate 1. 

The toal number of stamps issued to the various islands was 16,860, with a face value of \pound857 5s. 0d.

On the 19th August 1897, a question was asked in the Legislative Council as to whether the die used for the overprint has been destroyed.
