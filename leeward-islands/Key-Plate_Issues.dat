\chapter{Key Plate Issues}    

In 1890 it was decided to suprecede the individual issues for Antigua, Dominica, Montserrat, S. Christopher, Nevis and Virgin Islands by a general issue for the Colony, which was put on sale on 31st October, 1890. The remainder issues that were superceded were sold shortly afterwards.

The new postage stamps were printed by Messrs, De La Rue from plates of a stock design that was afterwards also used for many other Colonies such as St. Vincent, Northern Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Zululand, etc. The printing was done in two operations; the major or stock design was printed first from what is know as the "head plate" and the name of the Colony and the tablet of value at a second operation from what is known as the "duty plate."

So many stamps of different denominations were printed from this head plate that it had to be renewed after five years, plate 2 being brought into use about 1896, and for a similar reason plate 3 about 1900. As is the case for all stamps printed from these head plates, the impression for the low values is in lilac, and for the values of 1s. upwards in green. All the stamps are perforated 14 and watermarked Crown C.A. In the pence denominations the value is expressed in white figures on a coloured lined tablet and in the 1s. and 5s. in coloured letters on a plain uncoloured tablet.

The stamps were printed in sheets of 120, i.e. two panes of 60, each made up of ten rows of six. Around each pane is a coloured "Jubilee Line" and the plate number is shown as a large uncoloured figure on a solid circle of colour encloded by a thin coloured circle. 

A large range of shades can be found for all values indicating that many printings were made from each plate. In addition signs of wear in the plates can be found on the stamps.

In the early printings from all plates the lines of shading in the background, across the portrait, and in the hair and diadem are quite sharp and clear. As the plates became gradually worn, many of the lines are thickened and less sharp in outline, and those across the neck tend to join at the ends on the right and so form a thick line of colour down the nape of the neck. Later printings, still from very worn plates, show a thick line of colour about 1mm wide extending from just below the hair right down the back of the neck, and the shading lines in the background are spotted in various places.

The seven pence value was included in the set because this was formerly the minimum rate of postage on foreign parcels.

All values are known printed from plates 1 and 2, but only the three lower values are known from plate 3. All the values from plate 1 may be found with the gum ranging from deep brown to pale yellow in colour. It has been suggested that those of the darkest gum are from earlier printings, but there is no evidence to prove this. It will be noticed though that the stamps with dark brown gum are generally of a much deeper shade than other printings of the same denomination. Mr. B. W. H. Poole states that all printings from plates 2 and 3 have white gum, but A. E. Hopkins refuted this based on a copy in his own collection which was from plate 2 with a yellow gum.

An extraordinary error of printing in the one penny value occured. The specimen show the duty plate impression so badly centered that the final "S" of the words "LEEWARD ISLANDS" appearson the next stamp to the right. The "duty plate"  
Messrs De La Rue were so careful with their work that such marked example of misprinting is remarkable to have passed the inspectors. The specimen was first mentioned by Hopkins who had noted that only ten examples were in existence. The error was first chronicled in the \textit{Philatelic Journal of Great Britain} dated April 20, 1911.

It is also possible that such an error also exists in the 5s. value, as Mr. E. W. Aggleton was shown a photograph some years ago of a specimen of the 5s. value in a condition approaching that of the present variety.
