\chapter{1902 Provisionals}

 In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it was not an uncommon occurrence in 
the British Colonies for the regularly used stamps such as the half penny and penny 
values to become exhausted before the arrival of fresh supplies from the printers in 
England. In such emergencies, stocks of little used stamps were overprinted locally with 
the missing values and sold at overprinted price pending receipt by the Postal Authorities 
of fresh stocks.

This was not the case with the 1902 provisionals of the Leeward Islands. Following the 
death of Queen Victoria in 1901 there remained large unused stocks of the Queen 
Victoria 4d mauve and orange (SG.4), 6d Mauve and brown (SG.5) and 7d mauve and 
slate (SG.6) (used for the minimum parcel rate). The islands comprising the Leeward 
Islands were Antigua (including Barbuda and Redonda which in 1902 had no post offices 
on the islands), Dominica, Montserrat, St. Christopher (including Nevis and Anguilla) and 
the (British) Virgin Islands. The stamps of these individual islands were superseded by 
the general issue of stamps for the Leeward Islands on 31st October 1890. In 1898 the 
Leewards Executive Council approved the issue of Virgin Islands special stamps that 
appeared in January 1899. The 1902 Stamp Act allowed the Leewards Governor to 
authorise special stamps for the individual Presidencies, a move warmly welcomed by 
the islands who wished to preserve their individual identities and resulting in the issue of 
new stamps by the individual islands in 1903. 
 
The chances, therefore, of the Leeward Islands Queen Victoria issues of the 4d, 6d and 
7d being sold for normal postage purposes within a reasonable time of Queen Victoria's 
death were fast diminishing by 1902. The choice was either to destroy the stamps or 
overprint them with a common value that would sell quickly. The latter option was 
chosen. 



The 4d. and 6d. were surcharged in the same type, consisting of two words "One Penny" in two lines, with a thin bar to cancel the original value. The type was set up in panes of sixty, and the margins were torn off the sheets of stamps prior to surcharging.

These provisionals were put on sale in Antigua on the 11th August, 1902, and in the other Presidencies a few days later. The stamps used consisted as in the last issue of a mixed lot from stock; thus specimens of the 6d. and 7d. may be found with the brown gum of plate 1 and the white gum of plate 2. The 1d. on 4d., however, has only been found with white gum. In the case of the 1d. on 6d., the white gum is the scarcer, and the theory has been advanced that the stamps with white gum (plate 2) were the first surcharged, as various broken and defective letters may be found on teh sheets with brown gum, which are perefect in some of those with white.

There are four known varieties of the "One Penny” overprint on the 4d and 6d stamps. 
There is a tall “O” in One (positions 1, 27, 29 and 40) (fig.4); a broken “e” in Penny 
(position 48); a broken "e" in One (position 55) and the bar underneath “One Penny” is 
missing on some panes only at positions 17 and 43. There are three known varieties of 
the “One Penny” overprint on the 7d stamp. The “nn” is raised in Penny (positions 56-58 
and 55-59; the “e” in “One” is dropped (positions 51-53 55-58 and 56-58 and 60) and the 
second “n” in “Penny” is raised (position 54). 

Ian Jakes reported another variety a fourth variety of the One Penny overprint on the 7d stamp. To 
the naked eye “Penny” reads “Penay” with the “a” inverted but under high magnification 
the “a” in “Penay" is, in fact, a broken “n” (fig.5). The position is unknown; but it may be 
position 54 if the second “n” in “Penny” first became loose to form the raised second “n” 
in “Penny” variety and subsequently broke to form this new variety.

The official figures show that 37,200 of each of these three provisionals were issued, making a total of 111,600, and these were allotted to the several Presidencies as follows:

Stanley Gibbons lists the One Penny on 4d. with double surcharge (SG 17a). Very little information is available on the variety, which was never seen when A. E. Hopkins wrote his monograph on \textit{The Postage Stamps of the Leeward Islands}. The stamp appeared at auction and is illustrated in Figure~\ref{9911}. The stamp was accompanied by 1943 RPS certificate.
