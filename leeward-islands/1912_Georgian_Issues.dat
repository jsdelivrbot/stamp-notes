The 1/4d., 1d. and 2 1/2d. stamps bearing the head of King George V were issued in Antigua on October 23rd 1912. These were the first stamps of what afterwards was a most eventul issue. The 2d., 3d., 6d. and 1s. values were issued prior to March, 1913, as also the 1/2d., which was first issued at St. Kitts in February, 1913.

Owning to a stoppage of the vat-coloured yellow and green papers used for printing the 3d. and 5s. and 1s. stamps, provisional supplies of these stamps were printed on paper coloured on the surface only by means of an inked roller. These were sent out to the Colony and issued in November, 1913. This was the first appearance of the 5s. value. 
There was an immediate rush for these stamps from Collectors and dealers. 

The 5s. stamp on the vat-coloured paper was first issued in 1915. The re-issue of the 1s. value, however, was in gey-black on green, so copies of the original printing in black are seldom seen.

In 1916, the 3d. and 5s. values appeared printed on lemon-yellow paper. The 1d. value which was originally printed in red, appeared in 1915, printed in bright scarlet, from palte 3. The 2s. 6d. value has only appeared on the vat-coloured blue paper. Printings have been made from five plates in all, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; the 1d. and 6d. 

The printings of the 5s. on yellow and lemon-yellow paper are difficult to distinguish, as owing to the colour of the gum the back of the stamp is generally darker than the front, and a copy that is distinctly lemon-yellow on the surface can appear yellow from the back. The one penny red of the series was the first one discovered with the variety double-lined frame at left.

De La Rue introduced the Universal Key and 
Duty Plate system in Victorian times as an 
economical method of producing stamps in small 
quantities. This particular universal keyplate style 
has been termed the 'Imperium', after a series of 
essays produced in the Victorian & Edwardian 
eras, in order to differentiate it from the two later 
universal keyplate designs employed in the KGV 
era. 

Seventeen colonies employed the Imperium style 
keyplates in the KGV period, and, since they 
shared the use of the plates, plate replacement 
was a regular necessity. The average life of a 
plate was 2-3 years. Three keyplates were 
always available for use. The smaller colonies 
had their sheets printed in 120-set sheets and one keyplate was allocated to this role. Four 
colonies had large requirements for certain values, and two further 120-set plates were used 
combined to print 240-set sheets. One of these two plates was reserved solely for this purpose and 
thus was never used for BWI issues. During the KGV period a total of twenty-nine plates were 
used, numbered sequentially from 1-28. No other colonial design used so many plates, and the 
large range of plate numbers is one of the major attractions of this issue. 
Two dies were used during the life of the issue, known as Die I and Die II. Plates 1-9, and 23, 24 & 
25 were all made from die 1, the remainder being from die II. The use of plates 7 and 12 combined 
produced the well known 'die I / die II interpanneau' variety, and the seven Ceylon values issued in 
this format were displayed. Photographs of some of the De La Rue plates held in Malta were 
shown as examples of what a key plate looked like. 

There then followed examples of the 28 plates employed, in plate blocks and sheets, the two 
formats of Pl.1, known as Pl.1a and Pl.1b, being shown in complete sheets to illustrate the 
difference. Plates 22 and 27 are the most difficult to obtain, examples of Pl.27 being unknown 
outside the Royal Collection. Plates 14, 15, 24 & 25 were 100 set plates (10 X 10) specially made 
for Straits Settlements. The re-use of Die I for making plates 23, 24 & 25 was the result of a 
mistake made by the CA in issuing the wrong die. Examples of various flaws on the key plates 
were then shown, together with various means of identifying printings and plates by means of 
sheet numbers, weak printing impressions, damage to plate numbers and marginal rules, and dots 
in the key plate colour present on the sheet margins. 

Further photographs of the Malta duty plates demonstrated that De La 
Rue's preferred method of duty plate construction was to cut the plate into 
small sections and then mount them on the base board. There followed 
examples of duty Die Proofs, the different value tablet styles employed, 
variations in the same denomination value tablets for different colonies, 
single and double marginal rules and changes to the colony name dies. 
Examples of the different shade groups of the green and yellow coloured 
papers were displayed, with more shades than the catalogue defines for the 
yellow papers. Also included were three different surface shades of the 
yellow on Script CA paper. Several examples of an unlisted shade of olive 
green paper (Script CA) were shown, which included the Leeward Is. 1/- 
value from plate 28 (1936). 

The display concluded with an array of the various Plate No. / value 
combinations of the five BWI colonies that used the Imperium design, viz. 
Barbuda, Cayman Is., Leeward Is., St Lucia and Virgin Is. It was pointed out 
that it is rare to find anyone who has managed to complete all the Plate No. 
/ values for a colony, since there always seem to be a few very elusive 
combinations within each colony.
