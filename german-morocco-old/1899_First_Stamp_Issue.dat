# 1899 The First Issue.

The first postage issue was made at the time the chief office at Tangier and its first
six subsiduary offices were opened, on December 20, 1899.

At first, it was intended to surcharge the then current
stamps of Germany with the name "Marocco" only, as was done in the case of
the stamps for the offices in China. In fact, essays of the numeral and eagle
types of 1889 were produced with the name MAROCCO overprinted in block
letters, but these were never issued, for the reason that the Spanish currency obtaining
in Morocco was so much below the German value. The stamps actually issued, therefore, were overprinted "Marocco" and new denominations in Spanish currency in black. The overprint
reads diagonally upwards from left to right and though some specialists find
two slopes and two thicknesses of the overprint, the differences are really very
slight and hard to distinguish. The 3c on 3pf value was simply intended for
use between the offices themselves.
