# 1900 The Third Issue

In 1905, the fancy type of overprint
similar to that used in the foreign offices
in China and Turkey made its appearance.
In this overprint, the letters and
numerals are in fancy Gothic characters,
the German stamps surcharged being
those inscribed DEUTSCHES REICH.
The overprints were applied in the same
positions as on the corresponding values
of the last series, and also, similarly to
the 1900 issue, the surcharge on the 3
mark value was in red and on all the
others it was black. The new stamps
were first placed on sale about September.
Before this set was supplied to the
Moroccan offices, supplies of the 5c on
5pf ran very low and a new lot was ordered.
In filling this requisition, the
Government printers used the Gothic
type, which had already been decided on
for the forthcoming issue, on the 5pf
stamp of the REICHSPOST series.

Altogether, 220 sheets or 22,000 were
printed thus and the error was placed on
sale about the middle of September.
Dr. Rommel tells us that 18,500 were
sold and that the balance of 3,500 were
held at the disposal of the Moroccan offices
by the Government Printing Office
in Berlin. According to the Deutsche
Verkehrsseitung (Official Gazette) all
the stamps inscribed REICHSPOST
and surcharged for Morocco which were
in the keeping of the Government Printing
Office were ordered to be destroyed
in February, 1907, so that it is possible
the balance of the errors were burned
with other remainders at that time.
