The Fourth Issue.
In 1906, as the stocks of the old supplies
were used up, these stamps began
to appear on the lozenge watermarked
paper introduced for the stamps of the
German Empire in 1905. The 3c was
issued in February, 1906; the 10c appeared
in September and the 25c in December.
The next value to make its
appearance was the 5c which was issued
in February, 1907. Two months later,
the 6p 25c value appeared, to be followed
by the 2p 50c in July and the Ip
25c in August. It was not until March,
1908, that the next denomination—35c
—
appeared, and then over two years
elapsed until the 50c was issued. In
1911, the 30c, 60c and 1 peseta were issued
but the 3p 75c necessary to complete
the set was never issued on the
watermarked paper.
