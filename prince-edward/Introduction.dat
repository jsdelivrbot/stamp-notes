## Prince Edward Island

 Britain took control of Isle St. Jean from the French in 1763, renaming it St. John. It
became a colony separate from [Nova Scotia](../nova-scotia/Introduction) in 1769. In 1767 The British crown had
distributed the island in 67 lots, of about 20, 000 acres each, to those who it wished to
reward or recompense. These Lots have had a large influence on the history of the
Island and are frequently used as part of a postal address.

On February 1  1799 Royal assent was given to the bill changing the Islandâ€™s
name to Prince Edward Island in honour of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent,
Father of Queen Victoria and commander-in-Chief of British North
America at the time.
