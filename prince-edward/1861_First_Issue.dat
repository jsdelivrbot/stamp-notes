\chapter{Prince Edward Island}

The stamps were issued on the 1st of January 1861. They were printed by electro-type in London by Charles Whiting. The paper is unwatermarked on thick soft paper, slightly yellowish toned. The paper being soft and the type of perforation used resulted in poor copies. The issue produced some hard to find varieties.
