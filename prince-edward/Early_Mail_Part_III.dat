Many of these early letters are addressed to George Birnie  in London.  George Birnie (1786-1863) was part of the London mercantile firm of Alexander Birnie and Company which also operated the Waters & Birnie enterprise in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Birnie arrived on the Island in 1809 and the following year married Magdalen Stewart, daughter of John "Hellfire Jack" Stewart, owner of Mt. Stewart in Lot 37 for whom Birnie acted as London agent. In 1813 he returned to England where he remained until 1840 when he returned permanently to the Island. During those years there were a succession of agents who handled his business, land, and legal affairs.{{footnote:1}}
