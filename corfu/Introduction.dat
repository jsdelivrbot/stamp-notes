#### Venetian Rule (1386-1797)

In 1386, the island of Corfu, was surrendered to the Venetians, who sealed their rule in 1402 by paying 30,000 gold ducats for it. Although this period was characterized by peace and tranquillity, there were constant attacks by the Genoans and the Turks. In 1537, the Turk pirate Hairedin {{wi:Barbarossa}} came to Corfu to raid and destroy the island. Other Turkish attacks in 1571 and 1573 caused the Venetians to build the New Fortress of the town. The most threatening Turkish attack took place in 1716, when a powerful Turkish fleet came to the island, only to be defeated by the united front of the locals and the Venetians. According to tradition, during this raid, the locals were helped by St Spyridon and, due to this event, his litany takes place on August 11th. During the Venetian Rule, the island was ruled by the Venetian Noble and the local and foreign aristocracy and feudatory, according to centralization and strict laws. Society was divided in three classes: the nobles, the bourgeoisie and the commoners. The poor quality of life and the Venetian exploitation of the majority, inspired the commoners to constant insurrections during the 17th century which were violently suppressed.

### French, Russian Rule (1797-1814)
On 17 October 1797, after the treaty of Kamboformio, Corfu became part of the French state, and Napoleon came to the island as a liberator. In the central square, with the crowd cheering, the book the book of "Limbro d'oro" was burnt, along with its contents -the names and the privileges of the nobles- and the tree of freedom was planted as a symbol. During this period, public education was organized and a library and a printing house were established. Nevertheless, the majority of the people continued to live in poverty, being obliged to pay unbearable taxes. Two years later, the fleet of the alliance of the Turks, the Russians and the English defeated the French in Aboukir and disembarked on Corfu. Corfu's commissioners were now the Russian Admiral Oussakor and Agelos Orios. On 21 March 1800, in Constantinople, the "Ionian State" was established, remaining under the Sultan's supervision. The new Constitution re-established the orthodox church on the island and the privilege of administration was granted exclusively to the rich nobles. A year after signing the Treaty of Tilsit, by which Czar Alexander B' gave the Ionian Islands away to the French, Field Marshal Berthieux became Corfu's commissioner. This was a period of progress, as agriculture was developed, the Ionian Academy was founded, schools were built and the island's public services were organized. During this time, the English occupied other Ionian islands and, in 1814, they occupied Corfu.

### English Period (1815-1821)
####The Paid Crown Circle

The Treaty of Paris in 1815, signed by the representatives of Austria, Prussia, Russia and England, established the "United States of the Ionian Islands", which were to be under the supervision of the appointed English Lord Commissioner who was in charge of the regime and the military occupation. Although in the preparation of the treaty, Ioannis Kapodistrias, from Corfu, assisted as the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, the independence of the Ionian Islands was not achieved. When Thomas Maitland was appointed Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, the despotism of the regime caused popular insurrections. Nevertheless, during the English Occupation, the people were granted the privilege to choose religion, the roads and the town's water supply were improved and the education system was organized, with the founding of the first Greek university in 1824.

The most common handstamp is the crowned circle. Good copies retail at about $250 dollars each, although poor copies can be found at much lower prices.
