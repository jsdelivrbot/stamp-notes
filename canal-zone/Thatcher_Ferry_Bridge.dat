This error is considered to be one of the most spectacular modern errors in philately, especially given the controversy that
surrounded it. One full sheet of 200 stamps (which was cut into four panes of 50) 
was inadvertently printed without the silver bridge. 

only one of these panes of 50 ever made it into the public's hands, in this case the famous stamp dealer H.E. Harris, 
who successfully sued the Canal Zone Postal Administration preventing them 
from deliberately printing tens of thousands of similar errors 
(much like the famous U.S. Dag Hammaeskjold error), of the 
three panes that never made it into the public's hands, 
one pane of 50 each were laminated and donated to the Smithsonian Institution and the 
Canal Zone government, while the third pane was destroyed, leaving 50 stamps for 
the collecting public; this is position 18 (as indicated by a small light 
pencil position number on the reverse of the stamp) and is accompanied by a 1992 PF certificate. )

####Footnotes

The Bridge of the Americas (Spanish: Puente de las Américas; originally 
known as the Thatcher Ferry Bridge) is a road bridge in Panama, 
which spans the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal. 
Built in 1962, at a cost of US$20 million, it was the only 
non-swinging bridge (there are two other bridges, one at Miraflores 
locks and one at Gatun locks) connecting the north and south American 
land masses until the opening of the Centennial Bridge in 2004. 
The bridge was designed by Sverdrup & Parcel.
