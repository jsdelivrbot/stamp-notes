The Scott 39, stamps are amongst the most beautiful of all Canal Zone overprint issues. The way they were printed
resulted in many errors with the overprint being omitted, reading-up or down and a lot of other errors which are
listed and illustrated in this page.

It also includes an inverted center, which is very spectacular and terribly undepriced. So if you can get hold of
one I can assure you it is a very good investment in the long term.

If you have any varieties not shown here I will appreciate a scan in order to include them. In future I am planning
to make these pages interactive to enable collectors to add to this philatelic knowledge data bank.
