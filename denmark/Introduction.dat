One can consider the 2rbs stamp as a Government issued local stamp. It was only available at the special office of the Copenhagen foot-post which handled local letters. It was only from July 1854 the 2rbs functioned as a supplementary value on foreign mail that required one for correct franking.






Information on plating and printings can generally be found on specialized books or the Facit catalogues. It is a difficult issue to understand and collect.   

Such rare stamps have attracted forgeries an one needs to be careful when buying them. Almost all forgeries are without burelage and all show clear separation of the letters "-KILLIN" which on the original are joined on the foot.
