\chapter{Known correspondances}

A lot of the surviving covers have been preserved in relatively large archives, which 
unfortunately have been dispersed before being described fully.

\subsubsection{The Maclear Correspondence}

\subsubsection{Perkins}

\subsubsection{Burmeester Correspondence}

\subsubsection{The Farie Correspondence}

The Farie correspondence was literally saved from a bonfire by a schoolboy. It is a large archive that survived destruction and was described by Drysdall<sup>1</sup> in the
London Philatelist. Most of the surviving covers were posted from the Orange Free stated to Glasgow. 

\subsubsection{The Hope Correspondence}

Strictly speaking this is mostly mail from the Orange Free State<sup>2</sup>.
