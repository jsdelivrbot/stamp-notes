\section{The Second Definitive Issue 'Retouched Die' the Outer Line Removed}

(1871-1876)

As the old dies started to wear out the printers Messrs De La Rue \& Co. 
requested to have the original dies altered by removing the outer line frame. 
In addition they had the shading upon the figure of Hope and the vine 
leaves redrawn.

With the exception of the Six Pence and One Shilling stamps which 
retained the outer frame line.

It appears that De La Rue wrote to the Crown Agents on July 12, 1870 
reasoning that the firm was againt the stamps having thin frame lines
as these could be damaged and wear easily. The letter has not survived but
the Crown Agent's reply of July 13th did and we quote:

\begin{quotation}
Referring to your letter of the 12th instant respecting the renewal
of the Cape of Good Hope postage plate, duty 1d., I have to acquaint
you that the Crown Agents consent to the preparation of a new forme
at a cost of \pounds85, as well as you altering the die in the
manner proposed.
\end{quotation}

The new plate of 240 multiples was invoiced on October 26, 1870, and the next
supply of One Penny stamps was invoiced on June 8, 1871, when 687,120 were charged.


\subsection{The Five Shillings Stamp}

(Issued prior to 25th August 1871)


 
In February 1871 the Postmaster General reported the need for a 
higher duty stamp. His reason for his recommendation was that 
owing to the fact that several One Shilling stamps were necessary 
to frank a single letter inconvenience has been experienced through 
the covering up of the front of the envelopes and the concealment 
of the addresses. In addition difficulty arose by the stamps being 
detached in the post.
This was accepted and the die and stamps were prepared by Messrs. 
De La Rue and Co.



The first consignment amounted to 100 sheets of 240 stamps each. 
These were despatched from England by the s.s. Roman on the 9th June 1871. 
They reached Cape Town about the 17th July.They were issued to the public 
towards the end of August 1871.

\section{Printings}

Several subsequent printings of the Five Shillings stamps upon the 
paper watermarked with the Crown CC were made. Noticeable shades 
of the orange-yellow are obtainable.
