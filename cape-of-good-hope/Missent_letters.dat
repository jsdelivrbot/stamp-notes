Often due to errors made by mail sorters, letters were forwarded to 
incorrect destinations. Special handstamps (Goldblatt  SP 1 to 5) 
were used to identify this missent mail. Missent mail was also marked in manuscript. 
Two were in use in Cape Town G.P.O (SP 1 and SP 2). Port Elizabeth, Paarl, 
Robben Island, Grahamstown and Kimberley hd their own official handstamp 
for this purpose.  The country postmasters were not provided with 
handstamps but made a manuscript note on the letter which they 
initialed, e.g. 'Missent to Paarl'.

The Postmaster of Willomore used an improvised combination of 
marking the word 'missent'in manuscript and a locally made stamp 
with the name 'Willomore' to mark 'missent mail'. 
See an example here. See also examples of manuscript markings 
as used at Sea-Point here.
