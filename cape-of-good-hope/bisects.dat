THE C. L. PACK BISECT COVER

1858 (Apr 28) Wrapper sent registered from Fraserburg to Cape Town with 1855-58 Perkins Bacon 4d deep blue single and a pair, the lower stamp of which has been bisected so as to pay 4d postage and 6d registration, all tied by black triangular cancellations, rated "6" in manuscript, backstamped Fraserburg and Cape Town oval ds, the single 4d. creased, the entire with 45mm tear and other lesser faults not affecting the stamps

The ONLY RECORDED COVER with bisected Cape Triangulars (a front and several pieces are known)

The status of the bisect use had also been questioned, but this cover brings all doubts to an end. In the first place the rate is correct; secondly, the cancels both at left & right are matching and are genuine; thirdly, the standard practice of franking at top right of the cover includes the bisect, with the additional postage being a regular 4d stamp at left (if the bisect had not been part of the original postage it would have been placed at left); and finally, the cancellations tie all three stamps & the inner part of the bisect to the cover

One of the most important items of Cape philately
