\chapter{The Standing Hope Issue}

(Issued October 1893)

The introduction of the first stamps of the new design, which had been decided upon, was effected in October 1893 with the One Penny value making its appearance. " Hope " still continued to be the dominating feature, but having by this time remained seated for upwards of forty years, she now assumes a standing position, reclining with her right arm against an upright anchor.

The background consists of a view of Table Bay, with a steamer 
appearing on the right, and with Table Mountain in the distance, 
and is enclosed in a decorative frame containing the words 
"Cape of Good Hope" in un-coloured capital letters of 
ornamental character. A white tablet at the foot is utilised 
to denote the value expressed in words, whilst underneath appears 
the word " postage," the former being in small block capitals and 
the latter in small ornamental letters. Plain white circles fill 
the two top corners and contain numerals of the value, and a 
thin line of colour surrounds and completes the design, the 
original drawing for which was made by Mr. Mountford, of Capetown.

Messrs. De La Rue \& Co. prepared the new die and printing plate, and, 
from time to time, manufactured large quantities of the stamps 
upon the Anchor paper, and the numerous printings which took place 
resulted in the production of many distinct shades of both 
rose-red and carmine.

When, early in 1895, the decision was reached to effect a change in the general design of the 
Cape of Good Hope stamps, it was the intention of the authorities that as the 
printing plates of the old pattern became useless for further work, they should be replaced by 
plates made from the new __Hope Standing__ die, until the alteration had been effected in respect of each value.

Steps in this direction were accordingly taken. When it was 
reported in 1898 that the Halfpenny plate of the old type was no longer 
serviceable and required to be renewed, and in __October__ {{footnote:1}} of that year Halfpenny 
stamps of the new design came into use,






Printed by Messrs. De La Rue & Co., in green. Many shades of this colour exist. Plate proofs as well as essays exist.

###The "HOPE" Standing Three Pence (Issued March 1902)


\ph[35%]{../cape-of-good-hope/clip_image010.jpg}{ }
 
Early in March 1902 a further stamp of the " Hope " standing pattern was 
placed on sale in the Cape of Good Hope Colony. This was the Three 
Pence value which, 
in view of the subsequent adoption of the King Edward Design
was the last of the 
__Hope__ stamps. The __Standing Hope__ or __Sitting Hope__ has 
served the Cape of Good Hope for many years.

__The Edward VII__ designs, which followed the __Standing Hope__ issue, 
proved to be the last of its type with the Cape of 
Good Hope incorporated into the Union of South Africa as 
the Cape Province.
