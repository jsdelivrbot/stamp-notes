\chapter{Revenues - Cigarette Duty} 
Tobacco taxes can be collected either administratively, through the use of tax stamps (e.g.
banderoles), or by some combination of the two (British American Tobacco, 1994).  Under the
more commonly used administrative approach, tobacco products can typically be manufactured
only in sites approved by the taxing authority, with the payment of the tax occurring upon
delivery from these sites to retail outlets.

Alternatively, many Western European and North
American countries use tax stamps or banderoles purchased from the taxing authority for the
amount of the tax and then applied to the product's packaging.  In addition to being
administratively easier, this approach has the added advantage of making it possible to easily
distinguish legal, tax paid products from illegal products (for a more detailed discussion, see
Joossens, et al., this volume).

There are two different Cigarette Tax overprints. The first is a smaller format with letters being 1¼mm high, and this overprints exist on the ½d and the 1d. The halfpenny is common but the penny is scarce. The larger overprints with letters 2½mm high as you show exist on the same two values, but these are common.

They were issued after Act 12 of 1909 imposed a tax of ½d per ½ ounce of cigarettes in packets or boxes. This was effective from 15 November 1909.
