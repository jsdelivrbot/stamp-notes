In 1891 a circular datestamp with the letters C.G.H. -- an abbreviation of 
'Cape of Good Hope'- was introduced 
and widely distributed.

This datestamp survived many years into Union and was in use 
in some of the smaller offices, for example Paternoster as late as 1935.

Various circles, differing in diameter and lettering, were brought 
into use from time to time. The datestamp distributed in 1896 manifests 
two other characteristics, which assist classification: the presence 
or absence of dots before and after the name of the town and whether 
or not the letters are normal or wedge-shaped.
