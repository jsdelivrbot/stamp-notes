These were the first of the dated handstamps to be distributed throughout the colony and are thought to have been issued to the Cape Town General Post Office on 1 September 1853. Thus far the earliest recorded use is on 14 November 1853.

The design of these handstamps consists of two ovals of different dimensions on a common base with the name of the Town in the upper section created by the overlap of the larger oval with the date in the lower. several types are noted. The above numbering system follows Goldblatt. The most common designs are DTO 1 to DTO 3.

It was distributed to other offices from 15th December 1853. However, this initial distribution was not completed until 1854.

The DTO was used both for dispatch as well as a receiving datestamp. 

__This handstamp was not intended to be used as a defacer. The STO1 served this purpose.__ 

Both triangular and rectangular stamps are known cancelled with the DTO. On triangular's is scarce. Its use as a canceller is known at Elandspost, Swellendam, Colesberg and Zuurbon.

When the Dated Town Oval handstamp was brought into use in 1853, there were 95 post offices established in the cape colony (including the GeneralPost ofice at Cape Town). Some were only small postal agencies, established for the collection of letters and were not supplied with this handstamp.
