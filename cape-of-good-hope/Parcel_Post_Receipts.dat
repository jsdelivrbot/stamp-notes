At the beginning of the parcel post in the Cape of Good Hope no 
receipts were issued to the senders of parcels. 
Receipts were only introduced in 1890. 
The sender was able to obtain proof of having posted 
a parcel on payment of a fee of 1d, but this receipt or 
certificate, as it was termed, was intended purely for 
information, no liability accrued to the post office in 
respect of any parcel dispatched. 

The receipt was valid only if franked with a 1d postage stamp, 
defaced by the post office from which the parcel has been sent. 
This requirement continued until the Union of South Africa was formed.
