The Albany T.P.O
}

The Albany T.P.O. was located in one sorting van on the 
Midlands Railway Line section between Alicedale and Grahamstown. 
It was put into operation in 1896 and operated until 1897 when 
it became unviable and was terminated for financial reasons.

Only one type of postmark was used. The "UP" type is rare but a 
few copies exist. Only two copies of the "DOWN" type have 
been noted. (I still have not seen one and none was offered 
for sale for the last 7 years in any of the major Auction houses).
