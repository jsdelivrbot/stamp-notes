\chapter{Bisect on Cover}
The status of the bisect use has been questioned, but there is one cover and several used on pieces that have been certified as genuine. One cover was sold by Fedlmans in 2013 that according to the description: "brings all doubts to an end. In the first place the rate is correct; secondly, the cancels both at left & right are matching and are genuine; thirdly, the standard practice of franking at top right of the cover includes the bisect, with the additional postage being a regular 4d stamp at left (if the bisect had not been part of the original postage it would have been placed at left); and finally, the cancellations tie all three stamps & the inner part of the bisect to the cover." I am not too sure about the logic, but it is possible that there have been unauthorized use of the stamps by some of the smaller pot offices. The cover under discussion was posted from Fraserburg, which was a small town at the time. This first appeared in the C. L. Pack sale.
