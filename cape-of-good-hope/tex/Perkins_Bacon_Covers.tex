\chapter{Perkins Bacon Covers}    

Many covers have survived and have appeared in major collections. The cover shown in \ref{brickred}, was last seen when the William H. Gross Collection was dispersed by Spinks in 2007. It is interesting to observe how the apperance of the cover has been improved, by the addition of a small bit of letter sheet with backing added at the top, where the wax seal was cut away.
