Circa 1857 "Earl of Crawford" trials 6d. proof pair in orange on stout card. 
Exceedingly rare.
Ex Dale-Lichtenstein} 
 
  	  	 

There is a rare set of ten Six Pence and ten One Shilling proofs 
which originally belonged to the 26th Earl of Crawford who died 
in 1913. The Earl of Crawford has been one of the most distinguished 
philatelists of the last century. A letter in his handwriting states 
that only three sets of these were made.

This is also confirmed by a letter from Perkins Bacon. He refers to 
them as trials. They seem to have been in the Smuts collection at one 
time C.J Philips wrote of them as "the exceedingly rare pairs of proofs" 
all in fine pairs.

The pair shown here found its way in Dale Liechtenstein's collection 
and eventually in mine. It is impossible that these Crawford proofs could be anything else than colour trials made before printing the stamps in 1857. The 6d. prints are a shallow print and the 1s. pairs are deep.
