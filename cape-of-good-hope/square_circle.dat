\chapter{Experimental Square Circle Handstamps}


 	 
The design of the square circle postmark was similar to a British counterpart used widely in the colonies. At first the square circle cancellers were issued only to a number of major post offices, but from 1900 it found a general distribution. It appears that some 66 square circle cancellers were issued to some 55 different post offices. Cape Town was using the square circle handstamp from July 1882. This was followed by King Williamâ€™s Town and Port Elizabeth in 1884 and Queenstown in 1889. 

It remained in service till long after the Union in 1910 and is recorded in use in Kuruman in 1926, Victoria West in 1924, Knysna in 1913 and Ellis Post as late as 1940. Goldblatt classifies these handstamps in eight categories. Some additional varieties exist and I have modified the numbering to suit. In Cape Town the use of this datestamp stopped in April 1888 when the Squared Octagon datestamp was introduced. The G.P.O. squared circle reappears in the middle nineties again. This exhibit follows the development of these handstamps examines first day of issues and attempts to give an overview of their classification.
