##Sir Maxwell Joseph

When the late Sir Maxwell Joseph Collection was put up for sale in 1982 in London the younger and freshly married me was settling in South Africa. On the other side of the world Sir Maxwell Joseph (1910 - 1982) who passed away was the founder of Grand Metropolitan plc, a FTSE 100 business. He died after battling cancer on September 23 1982 and the sale took place on October 28. Like many other collectors he considered himself custodian of the collection and made sure that it got dispersed and the many good pieces in the collection decorate the next generation of collections.

One advantage of ebay is the ease one can find old auction catalogues 
of these famous sales.

Educated at Pitman's Business School, Joseph left school in 1926 
to work in an estate agent's office. He lost his job and founded 
his own estate agent's business in 1930 before serving as a lance 
corporal in the Royal Engineers during World War II.

He bought the Mandeville Hotel in London shortly after the War and, 
after buying up other hotels, built Grand Hotels (Mayfair) Ltd and 
then Grand Metropolitan plc into a large international conglomerate 
before being knighted in 1981 and retiring retiring from the 
business in July 1982.

He lived at Melksham Court in the Cotswolds.

Needless to say, I was not in a position at the time to buy 
even a single item from the collection and I had not even started 
contemplating collecting Cape of Good Hope. At the time my 
interests were only Cyprus and material was very scarce to come buy. 
When they did prices were prohibitive especially if converted in Rand. 
Partly because some other great collectors such as Crutwell kept buying 
all good material as soon as it appeared. Crutwell's Cyprus collection 
was sold in 2009.
