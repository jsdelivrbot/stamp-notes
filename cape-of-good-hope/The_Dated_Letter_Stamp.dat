\section{The Dated Letterstamp}

Lord Somerset when establishing post offices in each drostdy proposed 
that each 
post office has its own
handstamp. The proposal was turned down as being too costly.

It is of interest to note that during the whole of the pre-stamp period 
of the Cape of Good Hope, only Cape Town and Port Elizabeth 
used handstamps indicating the date. The First Dated Letter Stamp (DLS1) c
onsisted of the words "Post office" above and 'Cape of Good Hope" below. 
The design was such as to enable movable type to be inserted and change 
the date. This dated letter stamp was used exclusively by the Cape
Town post office.This appears to have been issued in 1823.

The letter stamp was classified by Goldberg as DLS 1 and DLS 2. 
As a matter of fact it is the same handstamp. For the first nine 
days of the month, the date was usually repeated by being placed 
before and after the month (DLS1) but from the tenth (i.e, for double digits) 
the day is inserted once only, usually to the right of the month (DLS 2).
