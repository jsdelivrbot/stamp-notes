###TPO Introduction

\phl[70%]{../cape-of-good-hope/TPO_Images/TPO-DOWN-2.jpg}{ }


Travelling Post Offices (T.P.O's) were normally operated in vans or coaches specially built for the purpose of handling and sorting mail on railways. They were usually attcahed to main-line trains. They followed the main train routes and were staffed by post office officials. To speed up the handling of mail, staff worked while the trains were in transit. Mail was picked-up and dropped at stations on the way.

T.P.O sorted mail normally received a transit mark at the back.

Mail could also be posted on the train into special T.P.O. letterboxes. In this case the stamps would be cancelled with a T.P.O. mark.

__The Travelling Post Office Service commenced late in 1882__. Special vans were fitted as sorting offices for postal material to speed up the delivery of mail on arrival. These vans were firstly attached to trains carrying mail from Cape Town but later the service was extended in line with the progress on the construction of new lines.


In 1883 the TPO went as far as Victoria West Road (now Hutchinson). In 1885 the service of the T.P.O. ran as far as De Aar, which was to become a main junction. Initially postmarks do not show any T.P.O. name and these are normally referred to as the No-name T.P.O. In 1890 the section from Cape Town to De Aar was named the Western T.P.O. A registered service was also offered.
By 1890 the main line from Cape Town to the north had been laid to Fourteen streams and the section from De Aar to this station was termed the Northern T.P.O. On arrival at De Aar the northbound T.P.O. van underwent a change of sorting staff and control was given to a mail officer responsible for handing out the mail on this Northern T.P.O. route. From 1890 the mails for the Eastern Province were transferred to the Midland T.P.O. at De Aar. The Midland T.P.O. covered the section between De Aar and Port Elizabeth. In February 1897 a new service to extend the T.P.O. to Queenstown was inaugurated. The section between Queenstown and Middelburg Road was called the Eastern T.P.O.


The section between Dea Aar and Middelburg Road was named the North Eastern T.P.O.
A sorting van on the section between Alicedale and Grahamstown was instituted in 1893. It was called the Albany T.P.O. and had a very short life. To improve on service to places served by the Graaf-Reinet branch of the railway a T.P.O. service was established between Zwartkops Junction and Uitenhage in 1893. This also had a very short service.

This section of the website deals exclusively with the history of the railways in the Cape of Good Hope. It traces the history through maps and notes. It alsodeals with special postmarks used by the postal services in railway stations as well as the travelling post offices (T.P.O's). Best way to view the section is by taking a tour.

Although Glodblatt provided some information on the postmarks of the T.P.O. the 
authorative work on this subject was the work of Hagen \& Naylor. 
The Hagen \& Naylor book divided the T.P.O.'s into 32 types 
(including postmarks for other southern african states at the time - as their work was focused on the railway postal history of South Africa). The T.P.O.'s of interest to the Cape of Good Hope are the following:
