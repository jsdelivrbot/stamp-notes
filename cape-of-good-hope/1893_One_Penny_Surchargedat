###1893 One Penny Surcharge


In March 1893 there were placed on sale the last of the provisional stamps 
issued by the Cape Colony, being the Two Pence value of the Cabled Anchor series overprint locally, " ONE PENNY "  the value obliterated by a bar. 

Delays in new supplies of the 1d stamp forced the authorities to supplement the Treasury stocks of that value by the 
local conversion of 10,000 sheets of the Two Pence stamps into the lower value.


The surcharging was carried out by Messrs.  W. H. Richards & Son in Capetown who in those days were the Government printers, in succession to Messrs. Saul Solomon & Co.

The full sheet of 240 stamps was surcharged at each operation of the printing machine.

Upon  __two__  of the stamps on each sheet the stop after the surcharged words is omitted. Namely upon the sixth stamp on the seventh row of the upper left-hand pane, and the sixth stamp on the first row of the lower right-hand pane.{{footnote:1}}

The stamp also exists with the surcharge doubly printed. __It is believed that one whole sheet at 
least was sold at the Port Elizabeth Post Office in this condition, for all known used copies bear 
the Port Elizabeth postmark.__


There are several minor varieties in connection with this surcharge which are described below, and it is necessary to note that the bar of the surcharge cancelling the words " two pence " was set up separately in respect of each stamp upon the sheet, not in a continuous line.
