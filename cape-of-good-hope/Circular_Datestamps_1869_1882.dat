These Circular dated stamps of the Cape of Good Hope Goldblatt Types (CDS 4 to 15) are all very similar in design. They show the month, day and year of use in two lines and usually an index letter. The name of the town is top, immediately within the circle, but exceptions are CDS 11 and 12, where the name of the town is split and CDS 13, where a street address appears above, with 'Cape Town' below.

These circular datestamps of the Cape of Good Hope were not intended as defacers. They were normally used for dispatching as well as receiving marks (see photo above).

A single-circle type with the office name in a straight line, thought to have been used at the post office at Salem. This village was established in the Eastern Cape by the British settlers of 1820.

date is located in two lines immediately below. 
Thus far CDS 8 has been noted as used between 1872 and 1879.

This Cape Colony postmark is 22 mm in diameter and was used in Moderfontein. Moderfontein was a money and telegraph office in the district Clanwilliam. What distinguishes it from other circular postmarks is the fact that the district name is shown at the bottom abbreviated C.W. (Clanwilliam).
