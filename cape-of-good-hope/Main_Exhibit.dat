##Cape of Good Hope - Postal History 
###Main Exhibit

In this display I am attempting to show the evolution of the posts in the Cape of Good Hope from the time the Dutch arrived to its absorption into the Union of South Africa in 1910. The area coverage is large and space limitations prohibit detail treatment of certain areas.

The exhibit starts from the establishment and organization of the Dutch period, hand-delivered letters moves into the First and Second Occupation.

A main milestone in the operations of the Post-Office was the Introduction of postage stamps. I show some of the problems the post-office experienced due to constantly changing rates, delays in shipments that necessitated.

The ever changing attempts to provide better devices for stamping of mail

The operations are explained via the different departments of the Post-Office. I explain registration, misdirected and missent letters the post-restante operations.

Overseas mails are traced chronologically via the attempts of the Post Master General to enter into mail contracts that guaranteed both a profit as well as timely delivery of the posts.
