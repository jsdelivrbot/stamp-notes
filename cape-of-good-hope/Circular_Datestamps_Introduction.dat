The first circular datestamps of the Cape of Good Hope were issued in 1864. 
At first these were only issued to the general Post Office at Cape Town and 
the Port Elizabeth post office. Over a period of fifty years new and varied 
designs were issued. This section examines all the designs and variants 
both for the single circle as well as the double circle cancellations.

The postmarks are firstly classified broadly into single or double circle 
and then divided into various types.

__This section does does not deal with the more specialised cancellations used in the 
ancillary services such as parcel post, T.P.O., Ocean Post and others which rather belong to 
different sections of this collection.__
 
It exclusively deals with circular markings used for dating and cancelling ordinary correspondence. 
The coverage of the earlier marks of this exhibit is mostly based on the James Perkins 
correspondence where material was adequate in my collection to form a coherent study with very little gaps. 
Now and then I have used colour prints of back of postcards and letters. 
This was intended to give the reader a flavour of the times when these postmarks were used.
