\chapter{Plating the Triangulars}  

In 1951, D. Alan Stevenson F.R.P.S.L., published his book on Cape Triangulars listing 62 identifiable varieties of the 4d. stamp and suggesting that there was a wide field open for further research. Commander F.W.Collins published an article in the London philatelist in 1960 extending this research. This article draws heavily on both sources.
