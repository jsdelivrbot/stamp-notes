The 'To Pay', 'Post Paid' and 'Prepaid' handstamps

In 1827 the Cape of Good Hope Parliament passed an act by which prepayment of postage was not compulsory and by which either the sender or the recipient had to pay.

The impression of a letter stamp on a cover could no longer be said to indicate that the postage has been prepaid.

Distinctive handstamps were made out of brass to differentiate between prepaid and unpaid mail. These were the To Pay and the Post Paid handstamps, which were brought into use exclusively at the general post office in Cape Town in 1827.

Two letterboxes were provided at post offices, one for paid and one for unpaid letters. The sender who wished to prepay postage handed the letter to the post office counter, where, after payment it received an impression of the Post Paid handstamp. It was then placed in the box for paid letters. Senders of unpaid letters dropped them directly into the appropriate letterbox and the postmaster would impress them with the To Pay handstamp when he made up the mail.

A few years later a new "To Pay" handstamp was issued to limited 
number of post offices in the Cape of Good Hope colony. It differs 
from the earlier one in having smaller lettering. Further types were 
also brought into use. These two hyphenated versions showing lettering 
measuring 4 mm and 5 mm respectively.
 

In 1846 the Cape Town general post office discontinued the use of 
the Post Paid handstamp and replaced it with the single word "Prepaid". 
This handstamp was in use for a much shorter period than the PP 2 and 
in consequence is scarcer.
 

Although the public had the option whether to prepay the mail or 
not, the post office gave preferential treatment to prepaid letters 
in the hope that senders would favour this approach.

 

 

As the Post Paid and To Pay handstamps were in use only at the 
General Post Office in Cape Town, country postmasters had to 
inscribe covers with the words 'Post Paid' or to 'Pay' by hand.
