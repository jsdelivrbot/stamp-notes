\section{Official Cape Government Railways Postcards}

At the beginning of the twentieth century, pictorial postcards became very popular. 
The Cape Government Railways issued a series of pictorial postcards 
that featured captioned views of southern
Africa scenery and railway transport, such as coaches and engines. 
Some of them also carried slogans encouraging the public to make 
use of rail service.

Hundreds of other cards were similarly issued by different publishers such as Sallo Epstein, Tucks , Juta and others. However these cards were never officially sanctioned and do not closely resemble the officially issued cards.

Hagen and Taylor, classified these postacrds into three series:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Series 1 (Large Logo)
\item Series 2 (Small Logo)
\item Series 3 Lettercards which constitute souvenir menus
\item Series 4 : Non-official cards, without railway logos, 
with scenic views and formats reminiscent of those 
featured in series 1 and Series 2 and 3. 
\end{enumerate}

Series 2 cards were issued in march 1907 and Series 1 cards were issued in may 1907. The sets were sold in distinctive orange-coloured envelopes, and with them there was a postcard-sized pamphlet (dated may 1907) which decribed the series.
