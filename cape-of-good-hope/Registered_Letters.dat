Registration of letters appeared early in the Postal History of the 
Cape of Good Hope. Rhenius proclamation of the 2nd March 1792 provided 
for the establishment of a postal system at the Cape of Good Hope. 
This early postal system required that the Postmaster on payment of a 
fee of four stuivers, would record details of any letter or packet 
in a special book kept at the post office and would also make an 
annotation and append his signature above or below the seal which 
secured the letter or packet. No liability accrued to the post office, 
however in the event of a loss.

Establishment Of Registration Section in the Cape of Good Hope
With the spreading of post offices around the country a Registered 
Letter section was established at Cape Town's General Post Office 
to deal with this class of mail. By January 1854 the term 'Registered' 
was firmly established.
Registered Datestamps and handstamps in the Cape of Good Hope

\ph[30%]{../cape-of-good-hope/clip_image002_0000.jpg}{ }

The first registered Letter datestamp  (RL1) was brought into 
use in the Cape of Good Hope shortly after 1854. It was, however, 
still necessary to write 'Registered' on the cover until about 1863-64, 
when a handstamp (RL2) replaced the manuscript marking.

On receipt of a registered letter the Postamaster would send an 
advice to the recipient to collect it.

The numbering of such letters was essential and the postmaster 
initially wrote the number on the envelope, alongside his office 
datestamp. Special registration handstamps (RL3 to 5) were 
introduced from 1909 onwards to facilitate the numbering.

  

A large variety of both circular and oval Registered Letter 
datestamps (RL 6 to 20) were in use. The horizontal oval 
handstamps (RL9 to RL18) were in most general use in colonial 
post offices for canceling adhesives whereas the circular ones 
were mostly used for back stamping of envelopes.

Printed receipt forms, similar to those in use today, were available 
to senders a few years later.
