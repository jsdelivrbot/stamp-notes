GERALD M KING LUNDY SPOOF ENVELOPE
GP 50
}

Gerald King is a well known British Philatelic Artist.  His Cinderellas 
cover a huge range of subjects.  Gerald's love of a really, 
really, bad pun, the wonderful stamps designs of the Victorian 
(in particular) era and an encyclopeadic knowledge of the life
and works of Charles Dodgson have led him to produce stamps 
covering such diverse subjects as

Wonderland (split into three areas; Pre-Alice stamps and covers; 
Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass)

Snark Island

Alternative Lundy

Elizatoria (which are Elizabeth II heads (eg Machin and Wilding) in classic Victoran stamp frames)

Tudor stamps

Reprints of classic USA stamps

Early Canada reprints

As well as the stamps he produces wonderful postal history.  Here he lets 
his wicked sense of humour loose on us all.

Whilst my budget will stand it I intend to show you scans on the 
postal history items.  I'll do the stamps as well but they don't 
make me laugh as much so have a lower priority  sorry.  Anyway, you 
can always buy Gerald's spoof catalogues which both illustrate them 
and make you laugh out loud.  What a bargain they are!

Let me know if you have anything I've not illustrated.  But minor 
variants of covers don't count as Gerald makes them all by hand to 
order so the covers depend on what's to hand, his mood and the size 
of his sausage supply.

\section{Jurgens}
The item below was auctioned on ebay on 14 July 2012, I am not sure 
if it was a Jurgen's fake but it has all the signs of it.

It fetched a price of \pound;800 ++ I stopped looking when it hit 730 pounds.
