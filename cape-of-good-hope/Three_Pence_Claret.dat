(Issued January 1881)

The representations made by the Postmaster General regarding the 
unsatisfactory colour of the previously issued 3d stamps were made 
known to Messrs De La Rue and Co. and the Crown agents. This led to 
the adoption of the claret shade for subsequent printings, a colour 
suggested by the Postmaster General.

The stamps were shipped on the 7th October 1880. They were first 
issued to the public in January 1881 and very distinct shades are 
obtainable.

By July 1882 the stocks were almost exhausted and the replacements 
were printed on Cabled Anchorwatermark paper.

\subsection{Blocks}

An interesting block was sold at the Franschoek collection by Spinks 
in June 2012. Blocks for this value don't appear on the market 
often and these get snapped almost immediately at very high rates.
