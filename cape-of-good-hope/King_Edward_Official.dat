The Cape Government Printing and Stationery Department adopted a system of perforating in connection with the stamps used by their Department upon their Foreign Mail matter. The stamps so used were first passed through a machine and a device, consisting of eleven round holes, in the form of two triangles, having their common apexes meeting in the hole at the centre of the stamp, was punched out, thus:

Definite information as to all the denominations of the stamps so treated is not available, but the following have been seen : One Penny, Two Pence, Three Pence, Four Pence, Six Pence, One Shilling and Five Shillings.

Other values of the King Edward stamps may be found with various forms of overprint for revenue purposes,
 and were employed in the collection of cigarette and customs duties. 
Although these frequently bear postal obliteraÂ­tions, they were never 
used for postal purposes, and have no real philatelic interest.


\subsection{Privately Perforated Stamps}


Stamps are found privately perforated normally with the Company initials to eliminate pilferage of stamps from the Company concerned.
Stamps are found for John Garlic, Cape Times Ltd., Union-Castle Steamship Co. Lt., C E Gardner & Co. Ltd., R Muller
