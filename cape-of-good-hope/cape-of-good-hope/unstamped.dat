Before the end of September, 1900, after the capture by the British of the railway line from Pretoria
to the eastern border at Komatipoort and the flight of President Kruger to Mozambique, a number of Burghers, some with families, who were temporarily encamped on the border were ordered to cross into Mozambique by train and to exile themselves voluntarily. This was necessary to avoid their capture by the British, as these men were specifically volunteers from the Cape and were regarded consequently as rebels. If taken into captivity they were liable to be condemned to death as traitors.

Besides the burghers there were also between 50 and 80 families of volunteers who crossed the border and went directly to Lourenco Marques.

In addition to the CApe volunteers, groups of burghers from the Transvaal and the Free State crossed the border at Komatipoort to avoid capture by the British.

## Portugal

The Boers in Mozambique were regarded as internees without any undue attempts to restrict their movements. As a result, some of them began to filter across the border and to rejoin commandos in those parts of the Transvaal still i Boer hands. The British Government pressurized the Portuguse authoritis to remove this potential menace to Portugal. With Malaria becoming prevalent among the Boers at rabon Point (in Lourenco Marques) this decision was beneficial for their health and was welcomed for that reason only.

On the 27th March, 1901, General Pienaar, eight of his staff officers and some 650 military personnel, some of them with their families, arrived in Lisbon in the vessel _Benguela_. A week later the _Zaire_ arrived bringing Commandant H.P.Mostert, together with three of his family and a party of 56 women and 172 children. The following day the Portuguese corvette _Alfonso_de_Albuquerque_ landed ten more Boers, one of them a child. This party was said to contain "subversive elements" and was for that reason sent separately. In all it was reported that 1260 adults and 173 children were landed at Lisbon for internment and arrangements had to be made to accomodate them.

On their arrival in Portugal the bulk of the Boers were accomodated in the following three places:

- {{wi:Caldas_da_Rainha}} (Bath of the Queen). It appears that only families were accomodated here.
- {{Peniche}}, for single men
- {{wi:Alcobaca}}, for single men
