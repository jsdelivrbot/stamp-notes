            </table>The earliest accounts of the Hottentots occur in the narratives of Vasco da 
              Garnas first voyage to India round the Cape in 1497-1498. In 1510 the Portuguese 
              viceroy, Francisco d'Almeida, count of Abrantes, met his death in a dispute with 
              the natives. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">Unill the 17th century they were believed to be cannibals, but with 
              the occupation of the Cape by the Dutch, in 1652, more accurate knowledge was 
              obtained. A century of Dutch rule resulted in the Hottentots becoming a nation 
              of slaves and in serious danger of extermination, and thus the arrival of the 
              English in 1795 was welcomed by them. In 1828 an ordinance was passed declaring 
              all Hottentots and other free persons of colour entitled to all and every right 
              to which any other British subjects were entitled.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The name Hottentots was given to the indigenous African people of the western Cape of Good Hope Colony and the 
            adjoining German territory, formerly widely spread throughout South Africa. </p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              name is was given to them by the early Dutch settlers at the Cape of Good Hope, being a Dutch 
              word of an onomatopoeic kind to express stammering, in reference to the staccato 
              pronunciation and clicks of the native language. Some early writers termed them 
              Hodmadods or Hodmandods, and others Hot-nots and Ottentotsall corruptions of the 
              same word. </p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Their name for themselves was Khoi-Khoin (men of men), or Quae Quae, 
              Kwekhena, t'Kuhkeub, the forms varying according to the several dialects. </p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Early 
              authorities believed them to be totally distinct from all other African races. 
              The researches of Gustav Fritsch, Dr E. T. Hamy, F. Shrubsall and others have 
              demonstrated, however, that they are not so much a distinct or independent 
              variety of mankind as the result of a very old cross between two other 
              varieties the Bantu Negro (containing a distinct Hamitic element) and the 
              Bushman. </p>

              the labile. and the steatopygia of the women. The cranial capacity is also 
              nearly the same (1331 c.c. in the Bushman, 1365 c.c. in the Hottentot), and on 
              these anatomical grounds Shrubsall conclude that the two are essentially one 
              race, allowing for the undeniabl strain of Bantu blood in the Hottentot. This 
              view is furthe strengthened by the vast range in prehistoric times of the 
              lottentot variety, which, since the time of Martin H.K. Lichten-tein 
              (1800-1804), was known to have comprised the whole of Africa south of the

              have ceased to exist in any racial purity. The name which the Namaqua give to 
              themselves is Khoi-Khoin, and this name must be distinguished from that of the 
              Berg-Damara or Hau-Khoin, since the latter are physically of Bantu origin although 
              they have borrowed their speech from the Hottentots. </p>

              the process of extermination with which the Hottentots were then threatened, but 
              it did not promote racial purity. <a href="SirJohnBarrow.html">Sir John Barrow</a>, describing the condition of 
              the Hottentots in 1798, estimated their number at about 15,000 souls. In 1806 
              the official return gave a Hottentot population of 9784 males and 10,642 
              females. In 1824 they had increased to 31,000. At the census of 1865 they 
              numbered 81,589, but by this time the official classification &quot; Hottentot&quot; 
              signified little more than a person of mixed colour. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The returns for 1904 showed a &quot; 
              Hottentot &quot; population of 85,892. Very few of these were pure-bred Hottentots, 
              while the official estimate of those in which Hottentot blood was strongly 
              marked was 56,000.</p>
            <h2>Customs and Culture.</h2>
            <p><span style="font-size: large">Early writers that came directly into contact with the KhoeKhoe agree in describing them as a gentle and friendly people. They held in contempt the man who 
              could eat, drink or smoke alone. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: large">They were hospitable to strangers, even to the 
              point of impoverishing themselves. Although mentally and physically indolent, 
              they were active in the care of their cattle and, within certain limits, clever 
              hunters. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: large">They were of a medium height, the females rather smaller than the men, 
              slender but well proportioned, with small hands and feet. Their skin was of a 
              leathery brown color; their face oval, with prominent cheekbones; eyes dark 
              brown or black and wide apart; nose broad and thick and flat at the root; chin 
              pointed and mouth large, with thick turned-out lips. Their woolly hair grew in 
            short thick curly tufts and the beard was very scanty. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: large">Amongst the women 
              abnormal developments of fat were somewhat common; and cases occurred of 
              extraordinary elongation of the labia minora and of the praeputium 
            ditoridis.</span>1</p>

              one across the loins. They wore these cloaks all the year round, turning the 
              hairy side inward in winter and outward in summer; they slept in them at night, 
              and when they died they were buried in them. They had suspended around their 
              necks little bags or pouches, containing their knives, their pipes and tobacco 
              or dakka (Cannabis, or hemp), and an amulet of burnt wood. On their arms were

            <p style="font-size: large">Sometimes they wore sandals and carried a jackal's tail fastened

              one or two fringed girdles; and a skin cap. Both sexes smeared themselves and 
              even their dress with an ointment made of soot, butter or fat, and the powdered 
              leaves of a shrub called by them bucchu (Diosma crenata).</p>

            <p style="font-size: large">Their huts were in circles, 
              the area of which varied with the pastoral wealth of the community. In the 
              centre of the huts a hole served for a fire-place, and at each side of this 
              small excavations an inch or two deep were made in the ground in which both 
              sexes, rolled up in their karosses and slept. </p>

              skins for holding milk and butter, and mats of rushes interwoven with bast, were 
              all their furniture. Their weapons were primarily bows and arrows, but they also 
              possessed assegais,  See paper by Messrs Flower and Murie in Journ. Comp. Anat. 
              and Physiology (1867); and Fritsch, Die Eingebornen Sud-Afrikas (Breslau, 
              1873) and knob-kerries. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">To women much respect was shown; the most sacred oath a 
              Hottentot could take was to swear by his sister or mother; yet the females ate 
              apart from the men and did all the work of the kraal with the exception of the 
              tending of cattle and of the curing of the hides; the men, however, assisted in 
              the erection of the framework of the huts. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The usual diet of the Hottentots was 
              milk, the flesh of the buffalo, hippopotamus, antelope or other game, and edible 
              roots ahd bulbs or wild fruits. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">On the coast fish captured by hooks and lines or 
              spears were also eaten. Cows milk was commonly drunk by both sexes, but ewes 
              milk only by the women, and when cows milk was scarce the women were obliged to 
              keep to ewes milk or water. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">Milk was drunk fresh, and not allowed to turn sour 
              as among the Bantu. Meats were eaten either roasted or boiled, but for the most 
              part half raw, without salt, spices or bread. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">From some meats they carefully 
              abstained, such as swines flesh. Hares and rabbits were forbidden to the men, 
              but not to the women; the pure blood of beasts and the flesh of the mole were 
              forbidden to the women, but not to the men.</p>

              in this pursuit, especially the Namaqua, who were capable of training the horns 
              of their cattle so that they grew in spirals. (It is ineresting to note that this old custom can be found in many other civilizations). </span></p>
            <p style="font-size: large">Their social pleasures consisted 
              in feasting, smoking, dancing and singing a universal fact for all humans to to-day! </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">Dances were held every first quarter 
              of the moon and lasted all night, often for eight days in succession. Every 
              signal event of life, and every change of abode and condition was celebrated 
              with a feast. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">On the formation of a new kraal an arbour was constructed in the 
              Centre, and the women and children adorned and perfumed it with flowers and 
              branches of trees and odoriferous herbs. The fattened ox was killed and cooked, 
              and the men ate of it in the arbour, while the women sitting apart regaled 
              themselves with broth. Upon such occasions the only intoxicant was tobacco or 
              dagga (dakka).</p>
            <p style="font-size: large">Circumcision, which is common to other indigenoous poplations of the southern Africa, was unknown to the 
              Hottentots. When a  youth entered upon manhood a ceremony was performed. One 
              of the elders, using a knife of quartz, made incisions in the young mans body, 
              afterwards besprinkling them with urine. When a man killed his first elephant, 
              hippopotamus or rhinoceros, similar marks were made on his body, and were 
              regarded as insignia of honor. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">A very unusual practice reported in the early literature is fthat inger mutilation was common. This was especially prevalent among 
              women; this consisted in the removal of one or two joints of the little finger, 
              and, sometimes, the first joint of the next. The reason for this is doubtful; it 
              may have been a sign of mourning, or, especially in the case of children, it may 
              have been regarded as magically protective. </p>
            <h2>Marriage</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large">Marriages were by arrangement 
              between the man and the girls parents, the consent of the girl herself being a 
              matter of little consideration. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">If accepted, the suitor, accompanied by all his 
              kindred, drove two or three fat oxen to the house of his bride. There her 
              relations welcomed the visitors; the oxen were slain, and the bridal feast took 
              place. The nuptial ceremony was concluded by an elder besprinkling the happy 
              pair. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">Among the southern Hottentots these ancient usages have ceased; but they 
              are continued among some tribes north of the Orange river. Polygamy was allowed: 
              divorce was common. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">Family names were perpetuated in a peculiar manner the sons 
              took the family name of the mother, the daughters that of the father. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The 
              children were very respectful to their parents, by whom they were kindly and 
              affectionately treated. Yet the aged father or mother was sometimes put in the 
              bush and left to die. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">Namaqua says this was done by very poor people if they had 
              no food for their parents. But even when there was food enough, aged persons, 
              especially women, who were believed to be possessed of the evil spirit, were so 
              treated.</p>
            <h3>Musical Instruments </h3>
            <p style="font-size: large">The Hottentots had few musical instruments. One named the gorah was formed 
              by stretching a piece of the twisted entrails of a sheep from end to end of a 
              thin hollow stick about 3 ft. in length in the manner of a bow and string. At 
              one end there was a piece of quill fixed into the stick, to which the mouth of 
              the player was applied. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The rommel-pot was a kind of drum shaped like a bowl and 
              containing water to keep the membrane moist. Reeds several feet long were used 
              as flutes.</p>
            <h3>Government and Laws.</h3>
            <p style="font-size: large">The system of government was patriarchal. Each tribe had 
              its hereditary khu-khoi or gao-ao or chief, and each kraal its captain. These 
              met in council whenever any great matters had to be decided. The post was 
              honorary, and the councillors were held in great reverence, and were installed 
              in office with solemnities and feasting. </p>
            <p><span style="font-size: large">In certain tribes the hind part of 
              every bullock slaughtered was sent to the chief, and this he distributed among 
              the males of the village. He also collected sufficient milk at the door of his 
              hut to deal out amongst the poor. A part of every animal taken in hunting was 
              exacted by the chief, even though it was in a state of putrefaction when brought 
              to him</span>. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The captains, assisted by the men of each kraal, settled disputes 
              regarding property and tried criminals. A murderer was beaten or stoned to 
              death; but if one escaped and was at large for a whole year, he was allowed to 
              go unpunished. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">Adultery seldom occurred; if any one found parties in the act and 
              killed them he was not considered a murderer, but on the contrary received praise for his 
              deed. Women found offending were burnt. Theft, especially cattle-stealing, was, 
              severely punished. The thief was bound hand and foot, and left on the ground 
              without food for a long time; then, if his offenc was slight, he received some 
              blows with a stick, but if the case was an aggravated one, he was severely beaten, and then unloosed and banished 
              from the kraal. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The family of even the worst criminal) suffered nothing on his 
              account in reputation, privilege or property. The duel was an institution, If 
              any one was insulted he challenged his enemy by offering him a handful of earth. 
              If the latter seized the hand and the dust fell to the ground, the challenge was 
              accepted. If it was not accepted, the challenger threw the dust in his foes 
              face. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The duel took place by kicking, with clubs, or with the spear and 
              shield.</p>
            <h3>Religious Ideas.</h3>
            <p style="font-size: large">The religious ideas of the Hottentots were very obscure. 
              Francois le Vaillant says they had neither priests nor temples, nor idols, nor 
              ceremonials, nor any traces of the notion of a deity. Other authorities state 
              that they believed in a benevolent deity or Great Captain, whom they named 
              Tik-guoa (Tsu-goab). There were other captains of less power, and a black 
              captain named Gauna, the spirit of evil. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The moon was a secondary divinity, 
              stipposed to govern the weather; and its appearance each month was hailed with 
              dancing and singing.f George Schmidt, the first missionary to the Hottentots, 
              says they also celebrated the annual appearance of the Pleiades above the 
              eastern horizon. </p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As soon as the constellation appeared, all the mothers ascended 
              the nearest hill, carrying their babies, whom they taught to stretch their arms 
              towards the friendly stars. Some of the tribes are said to worship a being whom 
              they name Tusib, the rain god. An old Namaqua was once heard to say The stars 
              are the souls of the deceased, and a Hottentot form of imprecation is Thou happy 
              one, may misfortune fall on thee from the star of my grandfather.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such as it was, the Hottentot religion was largely ancestor-worship. Their 
              deified hero was named Heitsi-Eibib; and of him endless stories are told. The 
              one most generally accepted is that he was a notable warrior of great physical 
              strength, who once ruled the Khoi-Khoin, and that in a desperate struggle with 
              one of his enemies, whom he finally overcame, he received a wound in the knee, 
              from which event he got the name of Wounded Knee. </p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He had extraordinary powers 
              during life, and after death he continued to be invoked as one who could still 
              relieve and protect. According to the tradition preserved among the Namaqua, 
              Heitsi-Eibib came from the east. Therefore they make the doors of their huts 
              towards the east, and those who possess waggons and carts put their vehicles 
              alongside the mat-house with the front turned towards the east. </p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All the graves 
              are in true west-easterly direction, so that the face of the deceased looks 
              towards the east. The spirit of Heitsi-Eibib is supposed to exist in the old 
              burial places, and, whenever a  Hottentot passes them, he throws stones 
              on the spot as an offering, at the same time invoking the spirits blessing and 
              protection. Johann Georg von Hahn asserts that there are many proofs which 
              justify the conclusion that Heitsi-Eibib and Tsu-goab (the supreme being) were 
              identical. Both were benevolent. Both were believed to have died and risen 
              again. They killed the bad beings and restored peace on earth; they promised men 
              immortality, understood the secrets of nature, and could foretell the 
              future.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Various ceremonies were practised to ward off the evil influence of ghosts 
              and spectres, and charms were freely employed. If a Khoi-Khoi went out hunting 
              his wife kindled a fire, and assiduously watched by it to keep it alive; if the 
              fire should be extinguished her husband would not be lucky. If she did not make 
              a fire, she went to the water and kept on throwing it about on the ground, 
              believing that thereby her husband would be successful in getting game. </p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Charms, 
              consisting of bones, burnt wood, and roots of particular shrubs cut into small 
              pieces, were generally worn round the neck. There was also a belief that in 
              every fountain there was a snake, and that as long as the snake remained there 
              water would continue to flow, but that if the snake was killed or left the 
              fountain it would cease. </p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Offerings were sometimes made to the spirit of the 
              fountain. </p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In common with the Bushmen, the Hottentots venerated the <span style="font-style: italic">mantis 
              fausta</span>, a. local variety of the insect known as the praying mantis (<span style="font-style: italic">mantis 
              religiosa</span>). P. Kolbe saw sacrifices made in its honor when it appeared inside a

            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Hottentots had great faith in 
              witch-doctors, or sorcerers. When called to a sick-bed these ordered the patient 
              te lie on his back, and then pinched, cuffed, and beat him all over until they 
              expelled the illness. After that they produced a bone, small snake, frog or 
              other object which they pretended to have extracted from the patients body. </p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
              the treatment did not succeed, the person was declared incurably bewitched. If 
              death occurred, the corpse was interred on the day of decease. It was wrapt in 
              skins, and placed in the ground in the foetal postion. Death was generally regarded in a very stoical manner.</p>
            <h3>Language.</h3>
            <p>
              <!--EOF-->
              <span style="font-size: large">The Hottentot language was regarded by the early travellers and colonists as 
              an uncouth and barbarous tongtic. The Portuguese called the native manner of 
              speaking stammering; and the Dutch compared it to the gobbling of a turkey-cock. 
              These phonetic characteri3tics arose from the common use of chcks,sounds 
              produced by applying the tongue to the teeth or to various parts of the gums or 
              roof of the mouth, and suddenly jerking it back. Three-fourths of the syllabic 
              elements of the language begin with these clicks, and combined with them are 
              several hard and deep gutturals and nasal accompaniments. The difficulty a 
              European has in acquiring an accurate pronunciation is not so much in producing 
              the clicking sound singly as in following it immediately with another letter or 
              syllable. The four recognized clicks, with the symbols generally adopted to 
            denote them, are as follows:</span></p>
            <p>dental = ; palatal = ~ lateral = 1 ; cerebral = !. According to Tindall, one 
              of the best grammarians of the language, the dental click (similar to a sound of 
              surprise or indignation) is produced by pressing the top of the tongue against 
              the upper front teeth, and then suddenly and forcibly withdrawing it. The 
              palatal click (like the crack of a whip) is produced by pressing the tongue with 
              as flat a surface as possible against the termination of the palate at the gums, 
              so that the top of the tongue touches the upper front teeth and the back of the 
              tongue lies towards the palate, and then forcibly withdrawing the tongue. </p>
            <p>The 
              cerebral click (compared to the popping of the cork of a bottle of champagne) is 
              produced by curling up the tip of the tongue against the roof of the palate, and 
              withdrawing it suddenly and forcibly. The lateral click (similar to the sound 
              used in stimulating a horse to action) is articulated by covering with the 
              tongue the whole of the palate and producing the sound as far back as possible; 
              Europeans imitate it by placing the tongue against the side teeth and then 
              withdrawing it. The easiest Hottentot clicks, the dental aod cerebral, have been 
              adopted by the Kaffirs; and it is a striking circumstance, in evidence of the 
              past Hottentot influence upon the Kaffir languages, that the clicking decreases 
              amongst these tribes almost in proportion to their distance from the former 
              Hottentot domain.</p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The language in its grammatical structure is beautiful and regular. Dr Bleek 
              describes it as having the distinctive features of the suffixpronuminal order or 
              higher form of languages, in which the pronouns are identical with and borrowed 
              from the derivative suffixes of the nouns.</p>
            <p style="font-size: large"> The words are mostly monosyllables, 
              always ending, with two exceptions, in a vowel or nasal sound. Among the 
              consonants neither t, nor f no or v is found. There are two gs, g hard and g 
              guttural, and a deeper guttural kh. Diphthongs abound. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">There is no article, but 
              the definite or indefinite sense of a noun is determined by the gender. In the 
              fullest known dialect (that spoken by the Namaqua) nouns are formed with eight 
              different suffixes, which in nouns designating persons distinguish rnasc. sing. 
              (-b), masc. plur. (-ku), masc. dual (kha), fern. sing. (-s), fem. plur. (-Ii), 
              corn, sing. (-i), corn. plur. (-u), corn, dual (-ra). The adjective is either 
              prefixed to a noun or referred to it by a suffixed pronoun. This grammatical 
              division of the nouns according to gender led to the classification of the 
              language as se~-dcnoting, thus suggesting its relationship, in original 
              structure, with the Galla and others.</p>
            <p>There are four dialectical varieties of the language, each with well-marked 
              characteristics: the Nama dialect, spoken by the Nainaqua as well as by the 
              Hau-Khoin or Hill Damara; the Kora dialect, spoken by the Koranna, or Koraqua, 
              dwelling about the middle and upper part of the Orange, Vaal and Modder rivers;              </p>
            <p>the Eastern dialect, spoken by the Gona or Gonaqua on the borders of Kaffirland; 
              and the Cape dialect, now no longer spoken but preserved in the records of early 
              voyagers and settlers. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">Of the Narna dialect there are three grainmars: Wallmanns 
              (1857) and Hahns in German, and Tindalls (1871) in English, the last being the 
              best; and the four Gospels, with a large amount of missionary literature, have 
              been published in it.</p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The vocabulary was not limited merely to the expression of the rude 
              conceptions that were characteristic of primitive people. It possesses such words 
              as koi, human being; khoi-si, kindly or friendly; koi-si-b, philanthropist; 
              khoi-si-s, humanity; ~ ei, to think; ~ ei-s, thought; amo, eternal; amo-si-b, 
              eternity; tsa, to feel; Isa-b, feeling, sentiment; tsa-kha, to condole; ama, 
              true; ama-b, the truth; anu, sacred; anu-si-b, holiness; esa, pretty; anu-xa, 
              full of beauty.</p>
            <h3>Literature and History.</h3>
            <p style="font-size: large">Much traditionary literature fables, myths and 
              legends existed amongst the Hottentots,a fact first made known by Sir James 
              Alexander, who in his journey through Great Namaqualand in 1835 jotted down 
              the stories told him around the camp fire by his Hottentot followers. These 
              Hottentot tales generally have much of the character of fables; some are in many 
              points identical with northern nursery tales, and suggestive of European origin 
              or of contact with the white man; but the majority bear evidence of being tiue 
              native products. Bleeks Reyna-id the Fox in South Africa (1864) contains a 
              translation of a legend written down from the lips of the Namaqua by the 
              Rev. G. Krdnlein, which is regarded as an excellent specimen of the national 
              style, Another legend relating to the moon and the hare conveys the idea of an 
              early conception of the hope of immortality.</p>
            <h2 style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Khoisan To-day</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large"> <img src="Historical%20Images/SAfrica.Khoisan" alt="South African Khoisan" width="335" height="504" hspace="7" align="left" />Today's <em>Khoisan</em> people normally dress   as westerners but do continue some of the traditions of rock painting, ostrich   shell neckless making and living simply. The rock paintings of the San people   are on rock faces scattered through the Kagga Kamma reserve. In Namibia some of   these paintings have been dated back as early as 27,000 bce making these some of   oldest rock paintings in the world. Certainly then, these people are carrying on   one with the longest continuous traditional image making forms of art known   today by still painting these rocks with twigs and pigment. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The Khoisan people were invited to stay on the Kagga Kamma reserve. Petrus   Kruiper, the artist pictured above lives nearby in housing built for him and his   family. They are not hired by the preserve but are urged to present their crafts   for sale in their traditional costumes to visiting groups. They provide this way   a living example of what it may have been like in earlier times for these   people. They normally are dressed in western clothes. This makes them hard to   distinguish from other South African natives at the same time continuing their   artistic tradition. </p>
