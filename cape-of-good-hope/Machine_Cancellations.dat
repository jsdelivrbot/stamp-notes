\section{Grahamstown Hand Roller Defacer}

Hand Roller Defacers (HRD 1 and 2) were intended to 
deface postage stamps on newspapers.

The ordinary defacing handstamps or obliterators proved 
unsatisfactory for this purpose, as they were prone to cut into 
the soft paper on which newspapers are printed. To overcome this 
problem, a metal roller with vertical bars spaced at 
regular intervals was used.

The only examples of these Hand Roller Defacers are from Grahamstown, where they appear to have been used exclusively. Although it may be surmised that other towns with their own newspapers may have made use of a similar defacer, there is at present no evidence to substantiate this.

There is uncertainty about the date on which the Hand Roller Defacers were introduced. AA Jurgens mentions a pair of 4d. Cape triangulars on cover, posted from Grahamstown to Cape Town in 1854, which bear the markings of this roller defacer between top and bottom bars is 19 mm.

This device was first introduced in the General Post Office at CapeTown in 1898 or 1899 to deface postage stamps while simultaneously datestamping letters. The use of straight-line Machine Roller Defacers was extended to some of the larger towns in the colony.

\section{Machine Cancellations}
<h4>MRD 2</h4>

The first cancelling machine was a Bickerdike taken into use in March 1899. After an interruption the machine came into use again for one year in 1903. the Bickerdike was
replaced with a Columbia machine in February 1904 and the latest
use is reported on 23 November 1909.

###The Crown C-C Machine Cancellations

The design of MRD 1 to 7 consists of a circular datestamp at the left with the name of the town, the date, and the time control expressed as "AM" or "PM". Horizontal bars extend to the right of the defacer and ï¿½ except for MRD 6 and 7 ï¿½ a central break between them contains a crown, flanked on either side by the letter C for Cape Colony. From 1909 onwards, these letters and the crown were dispensed with in the design.

###1898 MRD 1

MRD 1 was introduced in 1898-99. 
It has a circle with a diameter of 22 mm and is about 8 mm from the ends of the bars, which curve inwards
following the curve of the circle. 
The shape of the crown differs substantially from MRD 2 to 5 and the double C is 6 mm high. 
The bars are 3 mm apart, the top and bottom bars being approximately 59 mm long, 
with the second and sixth 55 mm and the fourth bar from the top 13 mm in length.

###1904 MRD 2
MRD 2 was allocated in 1904, with a circle of 22 mm in which the letters C.G.H. appeared in the bottom. 
Six of the bars are constant at 62 mm in length, while the middle bar on either side of the 
letters and the crown measures 15 mm. The letters are 3 mm high and the distance between top and bottom bars is 19 mm.

###The Wavy Line Machine Cancellations

The wavy line cancellations followed a similar design but the crown was now gone. 
These were introduced in 1904 in the General Post Office in Cape Town. (MRD 8-MRD 10).

__All three types were in simultaneous use__.

They comprised of a 22.5 mm circle with the words Cape Town on top and C.G.H. at the bottom.
