\chapter{Mail from the Boer Republics}    

It is known that Cape stamps were on sale in the Orange Free State from mid-1856<sup>1</sup>, and a cover addressed to Craddock in the Cape Colony posted in February 1859 and franked
with a Cape triangular 4d stamp cancelled at Smithfield has been recorded<sup>2</sup>.

Mail from the Orange Free State is difficult to identify, especially if the enclosing letters are missing. Any cover in the period 1850-60, with a manuscript '6' accountancy mark is a possible cover from the Free State or the Transvaal. The letter is in the
form of an outer blue wrapper

Cape stamps cancelled in the Orange Free State are very uncommon
a cover illustrated by Drysdall<sup>2</sup> is shown in the Figure below. It is attributed to John Taylor and is ex Ida Rothschild and Arnold T. Spangenthal and addressed to John S. Distin. It is tied with an unframed and undated 28mm 
circular mark inscribed \textsc{SMITHFIELD/BETAAL}, meaning Smithfield/paid. An oval Cradock datestamp struck in red testifies that the letter was received 
on FEB22/1859.
