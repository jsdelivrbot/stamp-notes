\chapter{Mail from the Boer Republics}    

It is known that Cape stamps were on sale in the Orange Free State from mid-1856\cite{drystall-01}, and a cover addressed to Craddock in the Cape Colony posted in February 1859 and franked with a Cape triangular 4d stamp cancelled at Smithfield has been recorded\cite{gericke-01}.

Mail from the Orange Free State is difficult to identify, especially if the enclosing letters are missing. Any cover in the period 1850-60, with a manuscript '6' accountancy mark is a possible cover from the Free State or the Transvaal. 

Cape stamps cancelled in the Orange Free State are very uncommon
a cover illustrated by Drysdall<sup>2</sup> is shown in the Figure below. It is attributed to John Taylor and is ex Ida Rothschild and Arnold T. Spangenthal and addressed to John S. Distin. It is tied with an unframed and undated 28mm 
circular mark inscribed \textsc{SMITHFIELD/BETAAL}, meaning Smithfield/paid. An oval Cradock datestamp struck in red testifies that the letter was received 
on FEB22/1859.

A few copies of triangular stamps with a Potchefstroom cancellations exist and a number of them appeared in the Dr. Drysdall sale. Prior to the introduction of stamps in 1869 it was necessary to affix Cape stamps on mail addressed overseas forwarded via Cape Colony. The Cape stamps were ordered by the then Postmaster of Potchefstroom, Herman Jeppe, in August 1859. The only available cancelling device was the 30mm. single-ring Potchefstroom datestamp.
