Occassionally Revenue stamps of the Cape of Good Hope are 
found on covers or pieces 'postally used'. Both Allis{{footnote:1}} 
as well as Jurgens{{footnote:2}} alluded to this fact. Robson Lowe 
in his Encyclopaedia of British Empire Postage Stamps, Volume II, 
The Empire in Africa, page 34, First Edition March 1st, 1949, writes:

\begin{quotation}
... Between 1874 and 1875 Revenue stamps were used postally 
and are to be found on covers. They are the embossed 1 d. 
brown and 6d. blue and the de la Rue 1d. watermark CC. 
\textit{All are rare}. (The emphasis is my own).
\end{quotation}

 
He also has an illustration shown. It is the considered 
opinion of most Cape of Good Hope philatelists that all 
these covers were as a matter of fact forged by Jurgens, 
who wrote about them extensively in his book, quoted above. 
It also appears that Robson Lowe's primary source for this 
information was Jurgen as he writes:

\begin{quotation}
... Special acknowledgement is made to Mr. A.A. Jurgens, 
whose standard work on the "Handstruck Letter stamps of 
the Cape of Good Hope has been the source of most of the 
information given above.
\end{quotation}  
 
The illustation shown here, is I believe in Jurgen's own 
hand and I presume... since he was generous enough to 
donate it for free that it was sent to Robson Lowe himself. 
There is reference  

 
Adrian Albert Jurgens (1886-1953) was a South African 
philatelist and signatory to the Roll of Distinguished 
Philatelists (RDP) in 1952.

In 1944 Jurgens won the Crawford Medal from the Royal 
Philatelic Society London for his work The Handstruck Letter 
Stamps of the Cape of Good Hope from 1792 to 1853 and the 
Postmarks from 1853 to 1910.


It appears that later on Robson Lowe discovered the 
fact \url{http://www.robsonlowe.co.uk/} and he famously declined 
to sign the RDP due to the organisers failure to 
delete Jurgens name. Lowe regarded Jurgens as a forger. 

Jurgen's main area of interest was the philately of 
Southern Africa, in particular the Bechuanalands and 
Cape of Good Hope, and the A.A. Jurgens - Cape of 
Good Hope, Barbara Jurgens Memorial Collection of 
twenty volumes is in the Iziko Museums of Cape Town.[3] 
Barbara was Adrian's daughter.

This piece of postal history has many angles pointing 
to an outright fake. If Adrian did it to prove a point 
or to profit is unknown. Since his collection was eventually
donated to a museum I tend to lean on the 'vanity' theory. 
Any information would be greatly appreciated.

He is still listed on the Roll of Distinguished 
philatelists on the \href{Philatelic Federation of 
South Africa (1948).}{http://www.philatelysa.co.za/RDPSAS.html}
