The Square octagon datestamp  (Goldblatt SO  1 ) was another experimental postmark aimed in finding a canceller that could be used for the simultaneous defacing and dating of letters. It followed the issue of the square circle postmarks. The Square Octagon canceller was issued to the Cape
 
 
Town General Post Office exclusively in 1887. The datestamp resembles those used in the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (Transvaal) at the time.

It appears that the earliest date of use was 1st May 1887 on a cover from Cape Town to Worcester. An example with dark blue ink has also been recorded. It had a very short lifetime and was replaced by the Hooded Circular Datestamp of 1888.
