#Revenue Stamp on Newspapers

\ph[90%]{../cape-of-good-hope/newspaper-revenue.jpg}{
Unique Complete Newspaper, Franked & Taxed by Same Stamp

 1835 Complete "Grahamstown Journal" of August 13, bearing at top right 1d embossed
 Newspaper stamp in orange-red, imperforate, a dry print but undoubtedly
 Sherwood C282a, usage split at right.

 Apparently ONLY ONE KNOWN on complete newspaper. Printed subscription rates at
 top refer to postage being included and suggest that the stamp paid both the
 newspaper duty and the postage (as was the case in the UK).

 Two others recorded on newspaper fragments (Burrus & Ferrary, 1836 edition of
 same newspaper), an exceptional item

 Estimate &euro; 3,000 - &euro;4,000
