\chapter{Resident Magistrate Mark}    

An interesting block of 1d red, Seated Hope is sown below. These stamps is cleared that they have been used for revenue purposes and the have been cancelled by a faint purple straight handstamp with the inscription \textsc{resident magistrate}. I could not find any information, where this was used and in which period, and I welcome information from  anyone that has seen something similar on a full document.
