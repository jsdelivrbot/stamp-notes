##The Large Triangular Obliterator

This obliterator was in use at the Stamp Office for fiscal purposes from 1837 onwards, but later it has been used to cancel postage stamps as well.

1903 Cover posted from Stanford to Cape Town, bearing the Large Triangular obliterator. . \label{LTO} }

The Large Triangular Obliterator, denoted by Goldblatt (LTO1) 
was pressed into postal service in the period 1857 to 1858 to 
cope with the shortage of defacing implements caused by the 
rapid growth of the Cape of Good Hope Colony and the need to 
extend the postal facilities. Goldblatt reports that it was 
known to have been used at Stanford as late as 5 November 1895<sup>1</sup>. 

Surprizingly the cover shown in \ref{LTO} above was sent from Stanford in 1903, 
proving that it was used for at least another eight years. Notably 
The Double Arc mark is also very late usage having been issued 
for the first time in 1857. There were some very diligent 
postmasters in those years.

Goldblatt identified ten variations of the obliterator, based on differences in measurements and the number of bars used. We have adapted this in Table 1.

\TR5 &b &34 &35 &11.5 &22
\TR5 &c &32 &36 &10   &21
\TR5 &d &32 &36 &10   &23

\TR5 &i &34 &34 &8    &22
\TR5 &j &33 &36 &9    &21
\end{stripedtable}

When identifying the obliterator, it is easier to start by counting the number of bars first. For example in \ref{LTO} it is easily identifiable that there are 19 bars which makes this an LTO(j) type. Minor varieties over and above the ones identified by Goldblatt exist and I am hoping to list them in the future.
