##The Large Triangular Obliterator

This obliterator was in use at the Stamp Office for fiscal purposes from 1837 onwards, but later it has been used to cancel postage stamps as well.

1867 Cover posted from Wellington, with oval datestamp in black, 
addressed to Somerset West, with Cape Town transit c.d.s., 
endorsed 'On Her Majesty's Service', (signed), with superb example 
of boxed "UNSTAMPED" in black (Goldblatt SP 17). Use of this handstamp is uncommon.

The Large Triangular Obliterator, denoted by Goldblatt (LT01) 
was pressed into postal service in the period 1857 to 1858 to 
cope with the shortage of defacing implements caused by the 
rapid growth of the Cape of Good Hope Colony and the need to 
extend the postal facilities. Goldblatt reports that it was 
known to have been used at Stanford as late as 5 November 1895. 

Surprizingly the cover shown above was sent from Stanford in 1903, 
proving that it was used for at least another 8 years! Notably 
The Double Arc mark is also very late usage having been issued 
for the first time in 1857! There were some very diligent 
postmasters in those years!
