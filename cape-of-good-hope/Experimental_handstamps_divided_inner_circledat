##The Divided Inner Circle Datestamp of 1898
	
  	 
###Introduction



The General Post Office in Cape Town began using this new type of datestamp in 1898 for both backstamping of letters as well as defacing of stamps. It appears that The Divided Inner Circle Datestamp was used exclusively at the G.P.O. head office of the Cape of Good Hope.

Contrary to other Postal History studies (Goldblatt and others do not treat it as an experimental handstamp), 
I have treated this datestamp as the last of the experimental handstamps due to the fact that 
this followed directly the use of the Compass Wheel. 
It was also the first datestamp to use the actual time, instead of a control letter. 
The experimental handstamps were all superceded later by the double circle datestamps of 1900-1902 
that incorporated most if not all the features that the post office required, such as the full time 
shown as am or pm, a design that was not subject to wear - a circle is obviously the best and a double 
circle even better.

__I could not find exact records as to when in 1898 this datestamp was first used but from records 
in this study it appears to be August 1898.__

The design consists of an outer circle with a diameter of 39 mm and two semi-circular lines, separated by the date and time control. The words "G.P.O. Cape Town" appear at the top, and "Cape Colony" at the bottom of the handstamp (DDS 1 to 3). Two variant types may be distinguished. The first (DDS 2) has the semi-circular lines connected by baselines to form two segments, while the other (DDS 3) shows the baseline only partially extended. When observing these designs Goldblatt notes that ..."the immediate reaction is to attribute these baseline deficiencies to wear, but from many examples seen the variants seem to be constant". I am in agreement with Goldblatt that from the examples of all three can be observed. However, I am not certain that all three datestamps were different designs. It can be observed from the examples shown in this page, which were during the first month of operation of this datestamp, the first issue was that of DDS 2, incorporating full lines into the design.

It is possible that as the datestamp worn out - especially given the fact that during the Anglo-Boer war there was an increase in correspondence - the datestamp was filed out to make the insertion of the time and date control easier.

It’s usage was terminated late 1901 or early 1902 superseded by the Double Circle Datestamp
