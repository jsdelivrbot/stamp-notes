###The Private Handstamps of the Cape of Good Hope
	 


During the pre-stamp period of the postal history of the Cape of Good Hope postmasters usually endorsed in manuscript instructional markings. Examples are postage due, to-pay or paid markings. (See to Pay Handstamps).

However, some of the smaller offices made use of 'private handstamps'. In 1847 the postmaster at Grahamstown produced his own handstamp with the words 'Post Paid' (Goldblatt PM 1). This handstamp is distinctive with the words 'Post Paid'. The frame consists of an elongated octagon and the corners have a clipped appearance. (Postmasters also manufactured other handstamps such as the cork cancellers).

During 1849, when the Octagonal Numeral letter stamp (ON 1) was brought into use, the postmaster of Stellenbosch evolved small private "To Pay" and "Prepaid" handstamps (Goldblatt PM 2 and 3), which
he used to mark letters in conjunction with the issued Octagonal Numeral cancellers (No. 30).

The postmaster at Worcester used a privately made wooden single-lined handstamp, 40 mm long, for a very short period during 1822 (PM4). Only three or four examples of it have been recorded and, like all the other handstamps, are extremely rare. I have a telegraph from Worcester with what appears to be the use of a similar handstamp some thiry years later!).

###The Port Elizabeth Private Handstamp PM 5

The Port Elizabeth post office used a mail bag seal to deface Cape triangular stamps on letters, its only known date of use on cover being 28 January 1859 (PM 5).

The very few known examples of PM 5 are unclear and typical of the result which might be expected from an instrument clogged with sealing wax and not designed to deface adhesives. The impression is that of a negative canceller.

PM 5 is circular, with a diameter of 23,5 mm. The words "Post Office" appear at the top and "Cape of Good Hope" at the bottom, both within a double-lined outer circle separated by two double-lined segments. "Port Elizabeth" is placed medially between the bases of the segments.

 
 
###Clanwilliam Private Stamp
 

During the Anglo-Boer War, the Clanwilliam postmaster either broke or lost his official canceller and for a short period used two private handstamps to cope with the situation (PM 6 and 7). PM 6 is a single-lined rubber handstamp, 28 rom long, with the name of the town, "Canwilliam", in script. PM 7 is worded "Post Office Clanwilliam" with the date, all in a single line of 45 mm. 1be letters of this handstamp are very small- only about 1,5 mm high. (see Clanwilliam Private handstamp for more).

A similar incident also occurred in Norvals' Pond.
