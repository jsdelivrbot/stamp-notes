Shortly after the General Post Office at Cape Town and the Port Elizabeth post office began using CDS 1 and 2, a supply of datestamps was received from England. However, due to a misunderstanding, however, the wrong type had been sent.

These datestamps were not in accordance with the selected design, as the words "Cape Colony" in the lower section were omitted.

Because they were urgently required, the stamps were accepted by the authorities and distributed to the various post offices for which they had been ordered, instead of being returned to the manufacturers.

The design of the second Circular Dated Stamp of 1864 (CDS 3) was similar to one used in Great Britain at about the same time. The diameter is 20 mm and the name of the town appears at the top. The time control index letter and the day, month and year, in three lines, are located in the circle.

In 1865, when the correct datestamps arrived and were distributed, some post offices used both simultaneously, with and without the words "Cape Colony". Impressions of this strike in green and violet should be avoided.
