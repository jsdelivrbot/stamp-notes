## Railway Stamps of the Cape of Good Hope
	 
The railway parcel stamps of the Cape of Good Hope date back to 1867.


The railway Stamps of Cape of Good Hope -perhaps having been over-shadowed by the 
fame of the Cape Triangular stamps - have received little attention over the years. 
Interest in these stamps has developed over the last twenty years especially 
after the publication of the Railway Stamps of South Africa by Hagen and Naylor. 

__The Cinderella nature of these stamps means that research material is hardly available.__

 

Some sixty years ago the famous philatelist J.H.Harvey Pirie wote that there is really very little and no essential difference between these stamps and postage stamps. What real difference is there between the stamps used to pay for carriage of a parcel inside a post office bag carried on a train and stamps used to pay for the carriage of a parcel loose in the van of the same train? I personally share this view.
Parcel stamps are not readily obtainable as it appears that these stamps were handled directly by the railway authorities and were not put on the parcel itself but on the waybill which accompanied the parcel to the destination station. As they never reached the public directly they found there way into the hands of collectors by a process analogous to that whereby proofs, essays and the like drift out on the philatelic market.
