\section{The Third Definitive Issue}

(1882-1883)

Early in 1882 a new type of paper was introduced for the various colonies. 
This paper was watermarked with a crown and CA (Crown Agents) in place 
of the Crown CC (Crown Colony) which had been in use since about 1863.

On March 22, 1881 De La Rue wrote the following letter to the Crown Agents:

\begin{quotation}
Messrs Turner \& Company., of Roughway Mills have consulted us, as the makers
thereof, about the present condition of the C.C. Postage Dandyroll. We consider
that the roll, which has been in use since the end of the year 1862, 
is fairly worn out, and that it would be wise, in order to ensure the out-turn 
of proper paper, to make a new roll \ldots
\end{quotation}

The proposal to renew the roll was accepted by the Crown Agents, who stipulated that
the new bits were to bear the letters CA instead of CC.

}

The new Dandy Roller was invoiced on June 29, 1881, but as the paper was invoiced
directly to the Crown Agents by the mill there is no evidence as to when it
was available for printing, and the De La Rue Da Book entries give no information
on the subject.


The first stamp to be issued on this paper was the Three Pence value, which was issued in July 1882.

For the Cape this period was of comparatively short duration as it would have paper with its 
own watermark the cabled Anchor in future.

  
\subsection{The One Penny Stamp}

(Issued August 1882)

\ph[30%]{../cape-of-good-hope/ADHESIVES/rectangulars-seated-hope/1d-noframe.jpg}{
Original Die Showing the Outer Frame Line (You can see the frame easier if you look at the bottom of the stamp)
}

This was issued in August 1882 by which time stocks of 
the previous issues were depleted. It is in all respects 
similar to its predecessor with the exception of the change 
of watermark. A considerable number of printings were made 
resulting in the production of the stamps in a series of 
readily graduated shades.
 

 
\subsection{The Six Pence Mauve}

(Issued August 1882)

\ph[30%]{../cape-of-good-hope/ADHESIVES/rectangulars-seated-hope/6d.jpg}{
6d Mauve}


This was also issued in August 1882. It is also similar to previous issues with the exception of the watermark. 
This stamp retained the thin outer frame surrounding the design.

 
\subsection{The Half Penny Black}
Issued September 1882
 


\ph[30%]{../cape-of-good-hope/ADHESIVES/rectangulars-seated-hope/Half-Penny.jpg}{
6d Mauve}


These stamps were ordered in April but did not reach 
Cape Town in time to prevent the necessity for the local 
Half-penny provisional which was issued in July. Grey-black 
was employed again although some of the printings were made 
in a shade closely approaching black.
