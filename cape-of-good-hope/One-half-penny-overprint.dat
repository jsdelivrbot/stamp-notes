In July 1882, the Cape of Good Hope postal authorities issued a 
new provisional stamp. This was the "One Half-penny " on Three Pence, 
claret. This overprint issue became necessary by the passing of 
Act No. 4 of 1882. This act introduced, amongst other alterations 
in postal rates, the charge upon newspapers transmitted inland 
was reduced to 1 1/2 d. each as from the first day of the 
month in question.

At the beginning of March 1882, there were on hand in 
the Cape of Good Hope Treasury, approximately 400,000 
stamps of the Half-penny value of the ordinary type, and 
anticipating that this quantity would be sufficient to last 
for some considerable time, and there then being some doubt 
as to the passage of the Post Office Bill through Parliament, 
the quarterly order for the supply of 48,000 stamps of the 
Half-penny value had been suspended at the request of the 
Postmaster General, after the despatch of the usual number in January 1882.


It was subsequently learned, however, that the Post Office Bill was 
to pass into law during the session of Parliament then sitting, and 
the Postmaster General of the Cape of Good Hope accordingly requested 
in April 1882 that the supply of Half-penny stamps might be immediately 
resumed, and that the quarterly shipment should be increased to 810,000 
until further notice.

Meanwhile the demand which was received for supplies of Half-penny 
stamps, from most of the country post offices, in anticipation of 
the commencement of the new newspaper tariff from the 1st July, 
had greatly reduced the Treasury stocks of that value on hand, 
leaving only small supplies for the Capetown Post Office and 
those of one or two of the other larger towns.


On the 30 th June the Postmaster General drew the attention 
of the Treasury to the position, and requested that the supplies 
ordered in April might be cabled for.He also requested authorization
from the Treathat in view of the urgent requirements that were 
envisaged by the passage of the new Act, authority might be given 
for the provision of a temporary issue by surcharging.


At the same time he pointed out that as the new postal tariff 
contemplated the reduction of the half-ounce letter rate inland, 
later in the year, from 3d. to 2d., the demand for 3d stamps would be 
greatly reduced, and that the opportunity should therefore be taken 
to meet the present emergency by utilizing a portion of the 
accumulated stock of 3d stamps on hand in the Treasury vaults.


An order was accordingly placed with Messrs. Saul Solomon \& Co. 
to carry out the necessary work, and 1,000 sheets of stamps were 
handed to them for treatment, and were returned to the Treasury, 
duly surcharged with the new value, on or before the 7th July, 1882.

As has already been mentioned in the previous chapter, the Three 
Pence stamps upon the Crown ? A paper had come into use, and the 
bulk of the 1,000 sheets which were converted into Half-penny stamps 
were upon the paper with the new Crown C A watermark.

A few sheets, however, with tlic Crown ? ? watermark were included 
and received the surcharge, but, unfortunately, there is no 
information in the Cape Treasury records which would enable any 
estimate to be made as to the actual number. Whatever this number 
was very few stamps survived with this overprint on Crown CC paper.

The surcharged stamps were handed to the Postmaster General on 
or before the 7th July 1882. Upon examination it was found that  
many of these sheets had been poorly overprinted.  The surcharge applied 
was greatly "off centre " as to render them useless for postal purposes.

A certificate files in the Cape Archives records that nNo less than 
428 of the 1,000 sheets were discarded and destroyed in the presence 
of a Treasury official.

A similar number of fresh sheets of Three Pence stamps were handed 
over to the printers, who were required to make good, their previous 
defective work, without extra cost to the Government.

In this connection it is noteworthy that the stamps bearing the 
surcharge in question which are watermarked Crown ? ? are nearly 
always found with the surcharge badly misplaced to the left of the 
design to such an extent that the letter "H"of" Half-penny " does 
not appear, having fallen upon the right-hand edge of the immediate 
left-hand neighbouring stamp, or, in the case of the first vertical 
line of stamps of the left-hand upper and lower panes, upon the 
outside margin of the sheet, and, in the case of those in the 
first vertical line of the right-hand upper and lower panes, 
upon the "gutter" margin dividing the panes.

The surcharge, which is in black, was applied to panes of 60 
stamps at a time. It consists of the words "One Half-penny" in 
two lines, printed nominally across the centre of each stamp in 
lower case letters with capital initials, whilst the original value 
is obliterated by a bar which may be found in two widths of 1.1 mm 
and 2 mm. The word "One" is 5 mm. and "Half-penny" 16 mm in length. 
There were no errors in connection with this local provisional, but 
varieties of considerable philatelic interest occurred, particulars 
of which are given below:

###VARIETIES (Watermark Crown CA only):

- With the hyphen between " Half" and "penny" omitted.
- With the letter " p " omitted.
- With the letter " ? " omitted.
- With the foot of the letter " ? " broken off.
- With a comma instead of a stop after the word " Half-penny."
- With the obliterating bar omitted.
- With the obliterating bar at top of stamp and the words " One Half-penny " below.
- With the obliterating bar at both top and bottom of stamp.

Note.  Other minor varieties, caused by the use of defective or 
broken type, also exist. Prima facie it would appear that as the 
above varieties exist on the stamps watermarked Crown ? A, they 
should also be found on those watermarked Crown ? ?. This, however, 
does not necessarily follow, and at any rate none lias been seen by the writer.

It is probable that the few Crown ? ? sheets, which were surcharged, 
were dealt with first, before type letters fell out of the forme or 
became damaged during the course of the work.
The Postal Act of 1882 (Act 4 of 1882)

###Extract from Postmaster's Report

Postal Act. - The laws regulating the management of the Post Office being 
scattered throughout the Statute Book from 1846 to 1879, making it difficult 
with the numerous amendments brought in from time to time, to know without 
considerable study the law upon any particular point, rendered it highly 
desirable that a consolidated law should be passed.


To prepare this the existing Postal enactments of the Mother Country and 
the several Colonies were carefully collated,and a Bill framed embodying 
the most advanced postal legislation was prepared.

In it provision was made for remedying whatever experience had shown to 
be defective in the existing law, and for carrying out improvements, such 
as the introduction of Postal Orders, the establishment of the Inland 
Parcel Post, the transmission of letters posted unpaid (which heretofore 
were returned to the writers), and the return of unclaimed prepaid letters to the writers free of charge.


The postage on letters inland was reduced from threepence to 
twopence the half-ounce, that on newspapers from one penny to a 
halfpenny, and postcards at one penny were allowed to be transmitted 
throughout the Colony.

Power was also conferred upon the Governor, by Proclamation in the 
Gazette, after the 1st October next (when the present Ocean Mail 
Contract ceases), to reduce the inland postage on letters to one penny - 
the half-ounce and on postcards to one halfpenny each. In view, however, 
of the state of the finances generally, and of the considerable deficit 
in the Postal Revenue as against its Expenditure, which will not be 
rectified until the new contracts are fully in operation, it is deemed 
expedient not to propose any further reduction until 1884, when the 
full effect of the working of the new contracts will be tested.

Power was also conferred upon the Government to enter into postal 
conventions with other Administrations.

Provision was also made in the Act for dealing with unpaid and 
insufficiently paid letters, as is the practice generally throughout 
the Postal Union, by charging them upon delivery with double the 
deficient postage.


This Bill, with slight amendments, was passed by the Legislature, 
and as Act 4 of 1882 constitute the whole of the existing Colonial 
Postal Law (1882, p. 13-14).
