After the Treaty of Amiens the first 
British Occupation was terminated and the Cape of Good Hope was 
restored to the Batavian Republic.

No other handstamps were used during the Batavian Republic period. 
The only one known is from the Burgher Senate illustrated here. 
This was actually a wax seal but is known to have been used to 
mark free postage.(See the image below shown the Burgher Senate seal).

The Burgher Senate Seal can be found impressed on wax. 
As this was the normal use for this handstamp it explains the poor 
nature of impressions on letters. 

Only three or four known copies of this datestamp exist.
