##Where to go from here

Notes:

Most of the content is unique.

Navigation and organization of the content took a long way to be defined and sorted out. 

The navigation buttons PREVIOUS/NEXT were an afterthought once the pages grew to a few hundreds I realized that a user (including me!)
would prefer to read some of the sections as a book. 

One of the aims of the pages is to attract other writers to contribute material.

Monetization is planned for the future, once traffic is assured by means of a shop as well 
as selective advertizements from dealers.

The Site also offers itself to tarde via ebay and other ebay 
like sites (for example the German). 

INTERACTIVITY only comes at this stage via the blog. The blog is a way of providing news to users and feeds.

USERS Possibly 3-4000 people, upper barckets wealthy.

Schoolchildren and teen-agers, newcomers to the hobby.

Keyword Management

Keywords=Tags These are used for searching as well as SEO (yes I know it does not count much!) The advantage thoughif you write keywords 
your mind settles better on the content.

Title Management - Most CMS would default this to either the Title of the Post or a General default. I felt that in terms of
attracting the right it may have to be slightly different. At the time of wrting the post - all in a text file, you can write whatever you wish.
Transclusion and templating were the last experiments and I left it at that.
