\chapter{The Cape Town Exhibition and its Postmarks}

The Cape Town national and international industrial exhibition took place 
in Cape Town from 20 November 1904 to 28 February 1905. The Cape Town 
Exhibition was located on Green Point Common. It was officially opened 
on 26 November 1905. A temporary post office and a commemorative 
datestamp was provided.

This commermorative datestamp was the second to be used in the Cape of 
Good Hope, the previous one being that issued for the Kimberley Exhibition.

 
 
The Cape Town Exhibition postamark is a double circle with diameters 
of 22.5 and 16 mm. 'Exhibition- Cape Town' appears at the top and a 
Maltese cross, flanked by two semi-circular bars, is at the bottom 
of the postmark. A time control and the day, month and year are 
centrally positioned.

Goldblatt reports that only a single example of this Cape of Good Hope 
postmark has been seen on cover and one on piece. As for many 
"unique items" others are discovered with time or belonged to 
collections that the postal historian was unaware. From my own 
research it appears that about five items exist with this marking.

The above illustrated cover was purchased from long time collector and dealer,
Henk de Lange PO Box 26261 Hout Bay 7872. [sastamps.co.za](http://www.sastamps.co.za)
who I would highly recommend.
