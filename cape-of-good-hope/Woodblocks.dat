Another postmark (PS 7) is, in the main, seen stamped on wrappers and circulars, but its use has also been noted on envelopes. The circle measures 27 mm and the upper numerals represent the day and the lower the month. Letters appear on either side of the postmark, but whether these have any significance beyond identifying the handstamp has not been established The roller cancellers (HRD 1 and 2) were intended to deface stamps on newspapers at Grahamstown and were used for this purpose until 1864 or '65, when they were replaced by the Barred Oval Numeral Cancellers, generally used for defacement purposes.  The larger post offices were furnished with the cheap rate matter strikes described above. When the Newspaper Branch Office was established at the G.P.O., Cape Town, it was issued with a special datestamp. This, and future handstamps of its type (NP 1 to 5), incorporated the Letters N.P.B. for Newspaper Branch in their design. NP 1, the earliest handstamp in use, is a box with clipped comers. line.

Four Penny Error of Colour
Stamps printed with the one penny colour, but using the four penny blue plate exist. This is one of the most sought errors in philately and they can be considered as the jewels of any Cape of Good Hope philatelic collections

These errors are exceedingly rare and expect to pay anything from \pound10 000 to \pound20000. These should not be bought without a certificate and without determining their provenance. These errors were part of all the famous collections such as the Maxwell, Ferrari, Lichtenstein and others and when they do come up for sale inevitably they can be traced back to one of these collections.
