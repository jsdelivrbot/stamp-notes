\ph[30%]{../cape-of-good-hope/Griqualand/No-2.png}{ }




The first markings to be used by the post offices in Griqualand West were the Cape's Small and Large Triangular Obliterators. (For Griqualand West Map see Map of South Africa 1885 and for a short history of Griqualand West see Griqualand West history).

###The Lined Circular Bar Dumb Defacer

In 1827 the Lined Circular Bar dumb defaccircularer (Goldblatt Type G1) was brought into use. This defacer was usually used in conjunction with the dated Town Oval handstamps allotted to Diamondfields and Du Toit's Pan. It was in use only for a short time before the introduction of the Barred Oval Diamond defacer. This defacer was not exclusive to Griqualand West and it had been noted at Queenstown and Piquetberg.

 
###The Barred Oval Diamond Defacers

These were introduced in about 1873. Thirty six bars of varying lengths form an oval enclosing a diamond shaped centre, which contains a numeral measuring approximately 9 mm. The bars form a letter "V" at each of the four corners of the diamond. These were used in conjunction with either the dated Town Oval datestamps or with other circular dated handstamps.


Ten numerals from 1 to 11 were incorporated in the diamond (6 and 9 for obvious reasons counting as one.) Only Nos. 1, 3, 4, 6/9, 8 and 10 were used there. These are discussed further in other pages of this exhibit.

This was issued to De Beers (New Rush). New Rush was afterwards named Kimberley. Goldblatt mention that after Griqualand was incorporated into the cape Colony in 1880, this defacer was returned to cape town and used for franking purposes and the obliteration of any incorrect charge marks noted on letters.
