Regulations drawn up by the Universal Postal Union governed the handling and mail matter landed from ships at the Cape of Good Hope and other members of the Universal Postal Union. Minor variations to these rules could be made within the framework of the general principles subscribed to by the members of the Universal Postal Union.

Of special note were the provisions that mail posted on board a vessel at sea required to be franked with the postage stamps of the country under whose flag the ship was sailing and at the postal rates current in such a country.

This mail, on transferral to the postal authorities of another country for onward transmission, had to be landed at the first port of call in such a country.

To qualify for exemption from further franking with local stamps, the mail had to be handed to the authorities by an officer or represenative of the ship. He would provide a written or oral declaration that the correspondence orginated on the vessel under the prescribed conditions.

of vessels and the consignee of goods (business houses
