1869 CAPE TOWN to DURBAN: Entire franked 4d ovpt and pair 1d (SG 27, 23a) well tied by three strikes of Cape Town numeral 1 duplex canceller AP 3. Front bears superb strike of "TOO-LATE" handstamp (Goldblatt SP7). Very early use of this postmark, rare.
}







Letters, which were posted too late to be included in the mail already, made up on payment of a surcharge could be included. The official handstamps supplied to post offices to denote that letters had been posted late are Goldblatt Type SP 6 to 13. Some letters do not bear any stamp, but manuscript markings. In other instances postmasters who had not received the official handstamps made their own in various shapes and sizes, three examples of which are SP 14 to 16.
1846


Letters were received at the post office for any of the country districts until 8 p.m. or and newspapers until 7 p.m.

                For letters sent between 7 and 7.30 p.m.       6d
                For letters between 7.30 and 8.00 p.m.          1s

There are many variants of this marking and will illustrate more in a future update of this page.

\ph[75%]{../cape-of-good-hope/too-late-small.jpg}{card 'POSTED TOO LATE' from 
  Cape Town to East London.}

I bought this card from a very reputable Continental Dealer, who had it marked as Great Britain.
for $30, which I thought was a great bargain. The card was posted from Queensland on the 15 Apr 1896 paying a rate of 1\halfd rather than the normal rate for local posts and was marked 
\textsc{posted too late}. The card has the receiving handstamp of East London dated 16 Apr 96,
code 'H'. In the cape of Good Hope and British Post Offices in general these code letters denoted
the time that the letters were processed. Although the particular code letters correlated to times are not known for East London, one could take those of Cape Town as a guide. Based on this the letter was received
at the East London Office at between 1.15 --- 2 pm.

Not even DHL can better this service and if you 've been to those parts of the world, you can imagine how it was in those days.
