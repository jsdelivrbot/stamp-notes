Letters, which were posted too late to be included in the mail already, made up on payment of a surcharge could be included. The official handstamps supplied to post offices to denote that letters had been posted late are Goldblatt Type SP 6 to 13. Some letters do not bear any stamp, but manuscript markings. In other instances postmasters who had not received the official handstamps made their own in various shapes and sizes, three examples of which are SP 14 to 16.
