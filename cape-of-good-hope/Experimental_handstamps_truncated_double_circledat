###The Truncated Double Circle Datestamp of 1890.



The Truncated Double Circle datestamp (Goldblatt  TDC 1 and TDC 2) was issued to the Cape Town General Post Office in 1890, with a variant to the Graaf-Reinet post office. The design is based on an inner and outer circle, the inner divided by two heavy horizontal bars into three sections – an upper and lower segment, with a central area containing the date.

The Truncated Double Circle datestamp issued to the Cape Town G.P.O. (TDC 1) has a control letter in the upper segment, whereas the lower is blank. The outer circle diameter measures 29 mm and is broken at the bottom. The inner circle measures 18 mm.

TDC 2, in use in Graaf-Reinet, differs from the Cape Town strike in that the letters C.G.H. follow 
the name of the town and there is no cross at the break of the outer circle. 
A small star is located in the lower segment of the inner circle.

The Graaf-Reinet datestamp is a bit difficult to find, but is rather easier to get one for Cape Town.
