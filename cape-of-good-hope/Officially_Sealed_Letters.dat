Officially Sealed Mails of Cape of Good Hope

1910 cover from Beaufort West, Cape Of Good Hope to Montreal, 
Quebec with red "official seal" inscribed "Found open \& / 
Officially Closed / in Post Office / By= [initials]" on reverse, 
created by hand from a paper fragment. Highly unusual usage 
from the Cape exactly 2 weeks before it joined the 
Union of South Africa. Perhaps the remaining stock of 
official seals had been exhausted, hence the need make up one? 
A wonderful cover.

Back on thin, glassine-like paper Perforation: 
imperf Inscription: Inverted "--McC. \& Co., Ltd., 
Ldn.-- 1129. 6/95. 300,000". at center

Control Number: none
