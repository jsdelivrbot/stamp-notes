\section{Ascension, Stamps and Postal History}
Ascension Island is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, a dependency of the British overseas territory of [Saint Helena](../st-helena/introduction). 

Ascension lies in the trade winds eight degrees south of the equator and is a 
volcanic peak of a sub-oceanic mountain range which runs along the length of the Atlantic Ocean.

Ascension was discovered in 1501 by Juan de Noa, a Portuguese mariner, and for two hundred years a bottle post was in use between sailors, pirates and smugglers who called at the 
island. Although there are numerous recorded visits during the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, Ascension remained uninhabited until 1815. Following
Britain's victory over France the custody of the Emperor Napoleon was entrusted
to Great Britain whose Government decided that St. Helena was the most secure place.
In order to prevent help being given to Napoleon by which he might escape, possession of Ascension
was formally taken in October 1815, after which the island became Admiralty
property.

No postage stamps were officially available until 1867 when stamps of
Great Britain were sent out from London and this situation continued
until 1922. In that year the Admiralty ceased to hold the island as a 
'warship' and Ascension became a dependency of St. Helena, itself already a crown colony.




Like other British territories, it issues its own postage stamps, which provide a source of income for the island from sales to overseas collectors, as well as being used for domestic postage. The main export items are Ascension Island postage stamps, first issued in 1922, and, since 2010, commemorative coins (which are legal tender but non-circulating) and commercial fishing licences for long-line tuna fishing vessels operating to ICCAT quotas.

A secondary export is the international internet domain code .ac, which small UK educational colleges and science museums are favouring due to its similarity to .ac.uk, the domain code reserved for well established UK educational institutions.


\section{Early days}

Originally mail was carried on an irregular basis as ships called. A datestamp was in use from February 1858, and in 1863 the Union Steamship Co. began regular carriage of mail, continuing until 1977. 

On 3 March, 1867 British postage stamps became valid for Ascension mail, and continued in use until 1922, when Ascension became a dependency of Saint Helena.



\section{The First stamps of Ascension}

On 2 November 1922, nine stamps of St. Helena overprinted "ASCENSION" replaced British stamps. These were followed up in 1924 by a series of 12 using the St. Helena design, but inscribed for Ascension. In 1934 a pictorial series of ten engraved stamps depicted various views of the island.

\section{George VI}

In 1938 the pictorials were re-issued with a portrait of George VI replacing his father's image. Various colour, perforation, and watermark changes ensued, with the last being issued in February 1953.

\section{Queen Elizabeth}

A new definitive series of 13 in 1956 resembled the previous stamps, but was a little taller, and used maps and pictures of native animals in addition to local scenes. No further stamps were issued until 1963, when there was a series of 14 featuring birds.
From 1963 on, commemorative and special issues started to appear more frequently. In the 1990s the typical policy was to issue 5-6 sets per year, each consisting of 4-5 designs.
