\chapter{1937 Coronation} 
George VI's coronation took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony 
in a show of support for her son.

There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the government of India. Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome that the royal couple would have received likely to be muted at best, and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before World War II. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.

Ascension did no receive supplies of the coronation issue until their issue on 19th May 1937
a week after the intended date of issue. the public sent about 30,000 covers to Ascension with a request
for the three values to be affixed to each cover. This was hard work for the limited Post Office clerks and only 2,835 were handled on the date of the issue and into the early hours of the following morning. 
Registered envelopes handled the next morning received the cancellation of the 19th of May and
the registration number applied with the serial counter but without the blue crayon 'R' which was inserted earlier in the operation. The rest of the envelopes were handled over the next four days.

A few covers exist which were prepared on board the vessel \textit{City of New York} bearing 
the Ascension stamps and cancelled with a circular handstamp reading 'M.V. CITY OF NEW YOR/AMERICAN SOUTH
AFRICAN LINE, Inc'. In the Centre ofthis handstamp, which consisted of concentric circles of 34mm and 24 mm the words 'SEA POST' were added. The date was applied separately reading 'MAY 12th 1937'. These are
forgeries as the records of Lloyds show that this boat was in New York on 19th May!
