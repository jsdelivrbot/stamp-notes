\chapter{Great Britain Stamps used in Ascension} 

The "U.S.S. Pensacola" sailed from New-York Oct. 16, 1889 on the solar eclipse expedition, carrying a scientific expedition sent to the west coast of Africa under the auspices of the Bureau of Navigation of the Navy Department to observe the total eclipse of the sun that was visible there Dec. 22. The expedition was a failure as a number of scientists, did not travel to the original observation site as a result of an outbreak of malaria and were unable to view the eclipse at the secondary site, due to overcast conditions. This cover was mailed upon the return voyage.
