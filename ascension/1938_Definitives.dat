\chapter{1938 King George Definitives} 

\section{Lined Engraved definitives - 1938 to 1954}

The definitives issued during the reign of King George VI were printed from engraved plates
by Thomas De La Rue \&Co., in sheets of sixty (6 x 10) but in the second world war these
operations were bedevilled by the difficulties of obtaining paper and ink of consistent
quality and also by bomb damage to the perforating machines.
