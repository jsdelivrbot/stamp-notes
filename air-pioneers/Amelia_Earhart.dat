## Air Posts: Pioneer Flights
Amelia Earhart's story is not a great story for postal history but is the most interesting from all Pioneer flights. Here it goes.

Amelia Mary Earhart (July 24, 1897 – missing July 2, 1937, declared dead January 5, 1939) was a noted American aviation pioneer, and author.[1][2] Earhart was the first woman to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross,[3] which she was awarded as the first aviatrix to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean.[4] She set many other records,[2] wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences, and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots.[5]

__During an attempt to make a circumnavigational flight of the globe in 1937, 
Earhart disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean near Howland Island.__ 

Fascination with her life, career and disappearance continues to this day.[6]

###1928 transatlantic flight

After Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927, Amy Phipps Guest, (1873-1959), expressed interest in being the first woman to fly (or be flown) 
across the Atlantic Ocean. After deciding the trip was too perilous for her to undertake, 
she offered to sponsor the project, suggesting they find "another girl with the right image." 
While at work one afternoon in April 1928, Earhart got a phone call from Capt. Hilton H. Railey, 
who asked her, "Would you like to fly the Atlantic?"

The project coordinators (including book publisher and publicist George P. Putnam) interviewed Amelia and 
asked her to accompany pilot Wilmer Stultz and co-pilot/mechanic Louis Gordon on the flight, nominally as a 
passenger, but with the added duty of keeping the flight log. The team departed Trepassey Harbor, 
Newfoundland in a Fokker F.VIIb/3m on June 17, 1928, landing at Burry Port (near Llanelli), Wales, 
United Kingdom, exactly 20 hours and 40 minutes later.[51] 
Since most of the flight was on "instruments" and Amelia had no training for this type of flying, 
she did not pilot the aircraft. When interviewed after landing, she said, "Stultz did all the flying - had to. 
I was just baggage, like a sack of potatoes." She added, "...maybe someday I'll try it alone."[52]

While in England, Earhart is reported as receiving a rousing welcome on June 19, 1928, 
when landing at Woolston in Southampton, England.[53] She flew the Avro Avian 594 Avian III, SN: R3/AV/101 
owned by Lady Mary Heath and later purchased the aircraft and had it shipped back to the United States 
(where it was assigned “unlicensed aircraft identification mark” 7083).[54]

__When the Stultz, Gordon and Earhart flight crew returned to the United States 
they were greeted with a ticker-tape parade in New York followed by a reception with 
President Calvin Coolidge at the White House.__

###1932 transatlantic solo flight

At the age of 34, on the morning of May 20, 1932 Earhart set off from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland with the latest copy of a local newspaper (the dated copy was intended to confirm the date of the flight). She intended to fly to Paris in her single engine Lockheed Vega 5b to emulate Charles Lindbergh's solo flight. Her technical advisor for the flight was famed Norwegian American aviator Bernt Balchen who helped prepare her aircraft. He also played the role of "decoy" for the press as he was ostensibly preparing Earhart's Vega for his own Arctic flight.[82] After a flight lasting 14 hours, 56 minutes during which she contended with strong northerly winds, icy conditions and mechanical problems, Earhart landed in a pasture at Culmore, north of Derry, Northern Ireland. The landing was witnessed by Cecil King and T. Sawyer.[83] When a farm hand asked, "Have you flown far?" Amelia replied, "From America."[84] The site now is the home of a small museum, the Amelia Earhart Centre.[85]

As the first woman to fly solo non-stop across the Atlantic, Earhart received the Distinguished Flying Cross from Congress, the Cross of Knight of the Legion of Honor from the French Government and the Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society from President Herbert Hoover. As her fame grew, she developed friendships with many people in high offices, most notably, Eleanor Roosevelt, the "First Lady." Roosevelt shared many of Earhart's interests and passions, especially women's causes. After flying with Earhart, Roosevelt actually obtained a student permit but did not pursue her plans to learn to fly. The two friends communicated frequently throughout their lives.[86] Another famous flyer, Jacqueline Cochran, who the public considered Amelia's greatest rival, also became a confidant and friend during this period.[87]

On __January 11, 1935__, Earhart became the first person to fly solo from Honolulu, Hawaii to Oakland, California. Although this transoceanic flight had been attempted by many others, most notably by the unfortunate participants in the 1927 Dole Air Race which had reversed the route, her trailblazing[88] flight had been mainly routine, with no mechanical breakdowns. 
In her final hours, she even relaxed and listened to "the broadcast of the Metropolitan Opera from New York."[88]

###Los Angeles-Mexico City-New York
That year, once more flying her faithful Vega which she had tagged "old Bessie, the fire horse," 
Earhart soloed from Los Angeles to Mexico City on April 19. The next record attempt was a nonstop 
flight from Mexico City to New York. Setting off on __May 8__, her flight was uneventful although the 
large crowds that greeted her at Newark, New Jersey were a concern[89] as she had to be careful not to taxi into the throng.
