# The Stamps and Postal History of Gwadur

Donaldson called the stamps of Guadur a philatelic enigma. Their unusual origin lies with the ascension of Ahmed ibn Sa'id as ruler and the establishement, in 1744, of the Al bu-Said dynasty in Muscat.

## The First Post Office

The first postal service was established on April 12th, 1868, when an Indian Post Office was experimentally opened under the control of the Bombay Circle.
