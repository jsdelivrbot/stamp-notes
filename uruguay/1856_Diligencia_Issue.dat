\heading{Sala de Comercio de Montevideo oval handstamp} 
\ph[80%]{uruguay/105.jpg}{106  1857, June 6. Entire letter from Montevideo to Rio de Janeiro, carried by private coastal vessel to Brazil, with superb rococo "Sala de Comercio/De/Montevideo" oval handstamp in blue. The needs of 
the merchants for improvements in postal communications led to the introduction of a new marking in 
1857, when Juan G. Buela received from the national Government a new authorization for a late hour 
postal service in the "Chamber of Commerce". The finest example of this handstamp in existence, 
this being, to our knowledge, the earliest recorded cover. Cert. Hern\'andez Rocha. \euro1000 Tito II }
