\chapter{1856-58 Perkins Bacon Adelaide Printing}

Local printings soon commenced from the plates sent out, including the 1s., and although supplies of inks had been forwarded for use, the shades are distinct from the first issues. It is interesting to note the gradations in shades of the 1d., some of the Colonial prints (imperforate) being almost as clear as the London prints, and the general appearance is decidedly of a better class of workmanship than is generally found in the early Colonial prints.

The 2d. blood red was the earliest Colonial print, and the whole surface smeared with colour, although a few specimens are found of a better appearance owing to the plate having been properly cleaned. Then followed different shades of red, pale to dark, much more clearly printed. The stamps are catalogued by Stanley Gibbons in reverse and show the blood red as SG8 and the orange-red as SG7. The shades are easily distinguishable and also on mint copies one can distinguish easily that the printing of the orange-red postage stamps is much clearer than those of the blood-red. It is likely as printing was processing thee skills of the operators also increased.

Printing defects are not easily found but in the Prestige sale there was a dry print, possibly due to the claening of the plate.

The colour of the 6d. bears no comparison with the London print and is of a bluish slate shade with very little variation.

An official notice, dated July 8th, 1857, announced that stamps of the value of 1s. were ready for use. Early dates are difficult to be found of this issue, and which I think probably commenced with the shade referred to as or later printings being a red orange, somewhat rarer; soon afterwards the same shade appeared rouletted. If the 1s. had been in general use from July, 1857, dated copies would be obtainable and fewer pairs of the 6d. The 2d was apparently the first to be issued rouletted (February being the earliest date recorded) and of a dark red shade, the 1d. (pale yellow-green), 6d. and 1s. following. I can find nothing earlier than May for the 1d. You will note a pair of 1d. pale green on thin glazed paper imperforate between.

An extremely challenging set to complete, the 1/- red-orange being an especially difficult stamp to acquire.
