ONE SHILLING:1/- red-brown vertical pair from the base of the sheet Imperforate Horizontally SG 148a (BW #S16bb), large-part o.g., Cat ?1700 ($A3500 for a pair). Rare. Ex AE Fryar (1955) & William Frazer: acquired for a modest ?368, reflecting the situation where the buyer of the preceding lot - a similar vertical strip of 3, for ?1265 - decided he didn't want both items. [The ACSC states "Three mint vertical strips of 3 and a vertical pair can be traced". The pair, which is this item, is llustrated in the ACSC at page 1/124]
