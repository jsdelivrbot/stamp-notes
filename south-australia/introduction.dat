\chapter{South Australia}


SOUTH AUSTRALIA was the latest of the five states which prior
to 1859 comprised the British colonies of Australia to adopt
postage stamps for franking letters. The authorities in Adelaide
were doubtless impelled to take the step on several grounds, one
of which probably was the decision of the New South Wales
Government taken late in 1853 to use stamps for intercolonial
correspondence as well as for letters within its own territory. It would appear
that till then only what may be regarded as local letters were franked by stamps,
those for other colonies, largely conveyed by sea, being paid for over the counters
of the post offices. This, at all events, seems to be implied by the following notice headed:

Though, however, South Australia was the last of the Colonies to make use
of stamps for postal purposes, it was the first to make no attempt to produce
them for itself. It is true that Western Australia applied to London for its first
penny stamp, which appeared less than six months before the London print 2d.
of S.A., but for all other values it relied for several years on unsightly lithographic
productions of its own. It seems at least possible that artistic considerations
were not altogether absent from the decision reached at Adelaide, for while
Sydney Views and Victorian half-lengths have attained the pinnacle of joys for
ever, no one with the faintest tincture of taste in such matters would accuse such
clumsy creations of being things of beauty.



The decision of the South Australian Government to embark on the issue of
postage stamps for public use was reached apparently early in 1853, for under
date April 1st in that year the Postmaster-General, Mr. John Watts, wrote to the
Colonial Secretary as follows :

\begin{letter}
" With reference to your letter of February 28th last, requesting by desire
of His Excellency the Lt. Governor that I should furnish a specification of the
requisite postage stamps preparatory to the introduction of the system of prepayment
upon all letters posted : I now do myself the honour to enclose a sketch
of a stamp (not enclosed now) similar to that in use in England with the addition
in order to adapt it to this colony of the words ' South Australia.' As respects
the rate (2d.), I beg to observe that should that be continued as at present the
lowest rate in use in this Colony, anoVthe ship and inland to be fixed at a multiple
of 2d., it will be unnecessary to order dies of any other value. Being totally
unacquainted with the arrangements necessary for the carrying out of the system
of prepayment of postage by stamps and of the printing and sale of them, I
referred to the proceedings appointed . . . for the purpose of enquiring into and
reporting upon the management of the Post Office Department of New South
Wales ; and therein I find it has been deemed requisite to procure a press for the
purpose of having the stamps struck off under the immediate control of an officer
appointed for that purpose, by whom they are issued to the Postmaster-General
upon his requisition. I am not aware that I can afford any further information
upon this subject, but I would suggest that when the plate, press and obliterating
stamps are ordered from England one million of stamps be at the same time
ordered which will enable the proposed system to be carried into immediate effect
without the delay consequent upon the providing of an apartment etc., for the
setting up and working of the press."
\end{letter}

There are several matters of interest in the above letter to which reference might be made. The picture which it presents of members of what in spite of
high-sounding titles and designations must have been a somewhat primitive
community tackling a big and novel undertaking is a vivid and attractive one.
The provision of "an apartment etc.," for printing plant and operations tickles
the fancy of anyone familiar With the luxurious appointments of a modern " apartment
" in a city like New York. One speculates what the sketch " not now
enclosed " and similar to stamps " in use in England " was like. But the most
interesting feature of an interesting letter is the explanation which it supplies
for the curious fact that only 2d. stamps and their appurtenances were ordered
from London, and its naive suggestion that if country and interstate letter rates
were made in multiples of 2d. none but stamps of that value would ever be required.
It may be remarked in passing that the 2d. rate lasted in South Australia for nearly
sixty years and that until 1912 it cost as much to post a letter from one part of
Adelaide to another as it did to frank one to this country, and the rate was
Mr. P.M.G. Watts's twopence !

None the less, his dream of a self-sufficing twopenny stamp did not command
the consent of other authorities, for on January 25th, 1854, he again addresses
the Hon. Colonial Secretary in the following terms :

\begin{letter}
" SIR,

" In carrying into effect the recently enacted Local Post Office Act it
will be requisite to procure from England dies of postage stamps of the rates
respectively of sixpence and one penny, patterns for which I have now the honour
to enclose, and I would at the same time beg to recommend that half a million
of the stamps at the first-named rate, 6d. and two hundred thousand of the latter
rate, id. be ordered together with the following articles as suggested by Mr. Cox,
the Government Printer, viz. : paper of the proper quality sufficient for 5,000,000
of stamps ; 12 Ibs. blue printers' ink ; 12 Ibs. green ; 12 Ibs. red, all best quality."
And he further suggests " that the plates should be secured in duplicate which I
would recommend for those now ordered, as also for the two penny stamps
formerly ordered, should such precaution be deemed necessary by the Colonial
Agent on his advising with competent persons in England."
\end{letter}

The stamps and other necessaries must have been promptly ordered, but that
some hitch occurred in their production and delivery is evident from Parliamentary
paper, No. 35, dated August 15th, 1855. " Governor complaining non receipt
of 500,000 6d. and 200,000 1d. stamps ordered in January, 1854," subscribed
Richard Graves MacDonnell, Governor.

As a matter of fact the stamps were ordered towards the end of August 1853 (De Worms, p.133) together with an order for postage stamps for Van Diemen's Land and Victoria. (See De Worms, p.103). 

Bacon at the time tendered to supply the postage labels and other items for the sum of \pound340 7s 8d. and to deliver them within 16 weeks from the date of the order. The Tender was accepted on the 14th September 1853. The South Australia Twopence stamps were invoiced in April 1854.

\end{figure}

The second requisition in April 1854 called for One Penny and Sixpenny stamps. This time the cost was tendered aas \pound320 8d 8d. with a delivery time of 13 weeks from date of order.

The order was accepted on pril 22, 1854, but the plates were not sent to the colony until June 1855. 

The firm were so long in completing the order that Barnard wrote them this letter:

\begin{letter}
I have to enclose a copy of a letter from the Government of South Australia complaining of teh very long delay which you have caused by the non-supply of teh Postage Stamps before the month of June last whenn they were shipped P 'Victoria' and to request taht you will furnish me with the necessary explanation.
\end{letter}

A note from the letter in the maargin showed that the letter from the Colony was dated may 4, 1855, and was to be returned.


Similar delays and consequent complaints arose about the same time in
connection with orders from New South Wales. The reason for the delay was
explained to the Agent-General for Crown Colonies by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon
& Co. in letters dated May igth (re N.S.W.) and August goth (re S.A.), 1855,
extracts from which combine to tell the tale : 

\begin{letter}
" We deeply regret the delay which
has taken place and think you are entitled to know the cause why we have
sometimes of late been so wanting in our usual punctuality. When we undertook
to supply our Home Government with postage stamps we did not anticipate
anything like the demand, which began and continued annually to increase,
and therefore prepared ourselves with but one original die." . . . This
die continued perfect for many years, but about two years back the plates
prepared from it began to wear out much faster than at first, until finally they stood but one-fourth of the original wear and this obliged us to
multiply the plates threefold. This evidence came upon us gradually, and not
all at once ; if it had we should have declined further orders. At first we had
attributed the difficulty to imperfect steel, then to imperfect hardening, and then
to improper ingredients in the colour, until at last the real reason became too
evident to be longer doubted. Under these circumstances we were obliged to
employ the transferring press constantly (which we had not previously done)
upon the manufacture of plates for our own Government and they would not
suffer us to put them .aside for any other work. We at last gained consent to
have another original die prepared, the first having produced upwards of 50,000
postage heads upon steel. We have now taken the precaution to repeat and
perpetuate it upon other flat dies while it is new, so that the present one may last
for several centuries, which we could easily have done with the first, had we
anticipated the amount of the demand which has been made upon it. The
foregoing are the real reasons of the delay which took place in executing the order
for the Government of South Australia and which has been very mortifying to
us, as it is our desire, and has generally been our practice, to execute orders
entrusted to us in a reasonable time, and we have taken such precautions that
no delays shall take place hereafter. These facts we would rather have buried
in oblivion, but under the circumstances we think you are entitled to have them."
\end{letter}


As might be imagined, the delay thus explained by what had taken place in
London caused no small perturbation and not a little inconvenience in Adelaide.
It also had the result of necessitating a much earlier local production of 2d. stamps
than had been anticipated. Both these repercussions of it are reflected in a letter
from Mr. Watts to the Chief Secretary dated July 3ist, 1855. He writes as
follows :

\begin{letter}
" In consequence of the non-arrival of the 6d. postage stamps, which you will
be aware were ordered through the Agent-General so long ago as January 1854,
the consumption of the 2d. stamps (of which one million were received together
with the dies and press for the printing of them) has been very great, so much so as
to render it necessary that a fresh supply be obtained, and that can only be
accomplished by setting up the press and appointing an Inspector of stamps in
accordance with the 3rd Section of Act No. 4, 1853."
\end{letter}

Things moved slowly in Adelaide and with less justification, one is inclined to
think, than in London; for it was six weeks before the Public Works Department
through Captain W. H. Freeling " had the honour to inform His Excellency that
the apartment next adjoining the one through which the prisoners pass into the
Supreme Court House and at present used as a lumber-room could be obtained
for the purpose " of setting up the press and printing the urgently needed 2d.
stamps. Apartments are familiar places to most of us; so are lumber-rooms :
but while there may be apartments which degenerate into lumber-rooms it
smacks of antipodeal conditions to exalt a lumber-room into an apartment, and
then straightway to somersault it into a printing office. Nothing, however, is
impossible in Australia, and even in London we have witnessed the home of the
earliest philatelic creations being transmogrified into an auction-room where
many of its previous inhabitants were sold under a glorified drop-hammer.
Meanwhile, though they said nothing about it in their explanatory letter,
Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. had despatched the delayed 6d. and 1d. stamps some time before its date. For on September 5th, 1855, the Agent-General
writes the S.A. Colonial Secretary, presumably in answer to a letter complaining
of the delay :—

" Shipped 6d. and id. postage stamps on 19th June, 1855, by the
Victoria, and the bill of lading was forwarded to you in my letter of 19th June
last." In due course the eagerly awaited consignment reached their destination,
though " due course " in those days involved a voyage of four months ; for it
was not until October 26th that the P.M.G. wrote the Chief Secretary apprising
him of the arrival of " postage stamps of the value respectively of sixpence and
one penny," adding that " in accordance with the instructions received from you
they have been counted by the officers appointed for that duty and delivered over
to the Treasurer." Then follows an interesting note. " I have, however, to add
that the invoice forwarded states the numbers to be of M. 500,000, of 1d. 200,000,
whereas, on counting, the numbers were found to be of (1d. 499,680, of 1d. 200,160,
as appears by the certificates of the officers who counted them, viz. : G. W.
Hawkes, J. W. Lewis, Chief Clerk Postal Department." A simple division sum
discloses the fact that 2082 sheets of the sixpenny stamps were sent out and
834 sheets of the penny ; also that on face value the South Australian Government
were several pounds to the bad on a precise execution of their order.


From an official notice dated October 26th, 1855, quoted in the well-known
handbook, its authors not unnaturally conjecture " that the early part of October
was the actual date of issue of these two values." Such was not, however, the
case, for under date October 27th, 1855, and over the initials R. L. W. (Chief
Secretary?) a note is on record. " I presume the 6d. stamps will be issued at
once." This is endorsed : " Referred to the P.M.G. for reply. C. K. Richardson,
October 3ist/55," and on the same date and in all probability in a second
endorsement Mr. Watts replies : " They were issued on the 2/tli inst." So he
lost no time, and it seems likely that the notice quoted in the handbook, though
dated the previous day, was not posted up before the day of issue. The prompt
issue of the 6d. was doubtless due to the desire to economise the diminished stock
of 2(1. stamps and to avoid those multiples of two of which the postmaster was
enamoured at the start. Concerning the id. nothing is said, but it may be assumed
that in matters postal as in matters mathematical the greater includes the less.
The Postmaster-General's dream of an all-sufficient 2d. stamp which appropriately
enough allured him on All Fools' Day, 1853, had vanished by January,
1854, and a year later, to be precise on January igth, 1855, he was so wide-awake
to postal reality as to indite the following epistle to the Hon. the Chief Secretary :

\begin{letter}
SIR,

As I find that the issue of postage stamps of the value of one shilling
would be a great convenience to the Public and also tend to facilitate the business
of the Department, I have now the honour to enclose a pattern for a sample of
that value and to request that the necessary plates for the printing of them and
the other articles included in the enclosed list may be procured through the
Agent-General, and that he be requested to have them forwarded with the least
possible delay. * .
\end{letter}

The " pattern " enclosed has never thus far come to light, but it was, as will
be seen, of an octagonal design.

Whether the same causes that delayed the delivery of the two lower values
operated also in the case of the 1/- stamps is a somewhat uncertain point. But
there was delay somewhere, for the " Tender for supplying South Australia with  plates etc., for one shilling stamps " made by Perkins, Bacon & Co. is " dated
this I4th May, 1856," and in it they " engage to supply, of the best quality,
within /our months from the date of order, the articles specified in the undermentioned
list." How far an interval of sixteen months can be said to represent
" the least possible delay " which Mr. Watts desiderated in January, 1855, we
are left to determine for ourselves. Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co., however, were
in this instance well within their word, for it was on August 21st the stamps and
the plates were sent gut to the colony (Handbook, p. 79), so that it would be
nearly two years after the P.M.G. asked for the shilling stamps before they came
to hand. This is revealed in a letter from him dated February I4th, 1857. But
the delay was not the worst of it; for the stamps were neither in design nor
colour to his liking. This is how he writes to the Chief Secretary :

\begin{letter}
SIR,

In the month of January 1855, I forwarded to your office a pattern of a
postage stamp of the value of one shilling for transmission to the Agent-General
with instructions to him to procure the dies necessary for striking off stamps of
that value in this colony when required. He was at the same time requested to
send for immediate use half a million of the stamps.

In procuring the pattern referred to I was guided by the practice uniformly
adopted of distinguishing stamps of different rates by a different appearance.
This is found in practice to be requisite especially in the case of those of higher
value, and accordingly the sketch forwarded, as will be seen by the enclosed copy
of it, was octagonal in form, and in colour, nearly that shown.

The dies and stamps received recently, however, are of the same size, the
same oblong form as those of lower rates now in use in this department and nearly
of the same colour as those of the 6d. value, a resemblance which in the hurry
of business, especially by candle-light, will inevitably lead to much confusion in
the making up of the requisite accounts at the last moment of preparing the mails
for despatch. It appears to me that although full price has been charged, as in
the case of the first plates received by us, the same dies have been made use of
with merely the substitution of the words " one shilling " for " six pence."
Under these circumstances I have the honour to request that the dies together
with the colouring material and the half million stamps recently received be
returned to the Agent-General with a request that the original order as to shape
and colour may be strictly complied with.

It is unnecessary to point out the extreme inconvenience which must result
to the public service from any repetition of such departure from the exact terms
of orders transmitted to England.

IJiave, etc.,
JOHN WATTS,
P.M.G.

P.S.—As the rejection of the stamps supplied has unfortunately become
necessary there would be no objection if deemed advisable to have the form
changed, say, to an oval, something similar to the shilling stamp lately adopted
by the London Office, the colour, however, to be that of the pattern enclosed
and the words South Australia to be introduced.

\closing{JOHN WATTS.}
\end{letter}

This letter with its postscript is of considerable interest as a revelation of the man to whom in their earliest days the postal fortunes of South Australia were
committed. He shows himself to be a man of observation and of taste, keen to
adapt the ideas of others and to increase the efficiency of his department. He
sees the advantage of modified designs for stamps of different values; the
importance of printing them in colours easily distinguishable in artificial light,
and so forth. There can be little doubt that the octagonal design for a 1/- stamp
enclosed in his letter at the beginning of 1855 was suggested by the embossed
stamps then current in Great Britain, and his postscript shows him quick to take
advantage of a new idea. That postscript bears the further significance that
though it failed of definite result so far as the 1/- stamps were concerned, it contained
the germ of the idea that came to birth a little later in the 9d. value.

Here, as before, events proved stronger than the P.M.G. The demand for
1/- stamps became so urgent that the delay involved in securing new plates and
stamps could not be faced, and Mr. Watts, like the practical man he evidently
was, made a virtue of necessity. At the same time he was not going to allow any
Agent-General or any firm of engravers in London to force his hand beyond a
certain point. They had sent him stamps of a design he did not ask for and of a
colour that he could not use, and he could not wait till others could be obtained.
But they had also sent him plates ; so he would burn their stamps and print
others from their plates. And this he proceeded to do. Here is the story of the
daring deed.

\begin{letter}
C.S.O. 811/57. G.P.O., ADELAIDE,

May 2oth, 1857.

SIR,

With reference to my communication of the 19th February last, relative
to the postage stamps of the value of one shilling, which with plates etc., for
striking off additional supplies had been received from the Agent-General and
which I then reported not to be in uniformity either in shape or colour to the
pattern sent with the order to that officer, owing to which their adoption here
would be attended with inconvenience and risk, as the shade of colour is so near
to that of the 6d. stamps already in use, and therefore recommending that they
should be returned.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../south-australia/267991.jpg}

There is a small area of gum missing that could create the mistaken impression of a crease. [Far superior to the AE Fryar/Julius Beresford/John Griffiths/Harry Lower example - heavy vertical crease & coincident nick at the base - that sold for $18,400]

The Shilling Violet is South Australia's most famous stamp, and one of the most enigmatic rarities of the British Empire. 500,000 1/- stamps were received in Adelaide in January 1857. However, because they were the same design as the original three values, and because there was concern that the colour could be confused with the 6d - imagine lighting standards in Adelaide in the 1850s - the entire consignment was destroyed. It is believed that all surviving examples are derived from a block of 24 released by Perkins Bacon. Six of these bore the 'CANCELLED' handstamp, of which 4 can be accounted for. Of the other 18, Tony Presgrave accounted for the whereabouts of 15, of which four are in institutions: see "Shilling Violet" Issue No 1 (Aug 1985). According to Michael Blake, "a plausible reconstruction [based on alligning margins indicates this] stamp is position 240, the last stamp in the sheet".

\end{marginfigure}


But as these stamps have not yet been returned, and as so considerable a
period must elapse before the fresh plates can be had from England, thereby
causing much inconvenience to the public, I have now the honour to recommend
that the plates be now retained, and, in order to prevent the risk in their use,
above referred to, that a different colour—say buff—be adopted for the stamps,
the contrast of which with the colours of the stamps now in use will be sufficient
to prevent mistakes notwithstanding the similarity in form.

To carry out the above recommendation it will be requisite that the " shilling "
postage stamps which have been received be destroyed, and I have therefore to
request that authority for that purpose be given say as suggested by the Auditor-
General that they be burnt in the presence of an officer of his Department and of
the Treasury.

I have the honour, etc.,

The above figures show that exactly 500,000 stamps were destroyed; but
they also reveal the fact that Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. either sent 2083 sheets
and a block of 80 to make the number precisely that of the order which they
received, retaining 160 in London, or that 2084 sheets were despatched to Adelaide
and the balance of 160 stamps fell into more or less official keeping there. The
latter appears to be the more probable event since, at long intervals during the
last forty years, mint copies of the stamp have made their appearance in Adelaide.

In spite of the fact that there was time enough for Mr. Watts's report concerning
the exact number of the 6d. and 1d. stamps dated October, 1855, to reach them
before the 1/- stamps were despatched, it seems improbable that the printers
would cut into a sheet for the sake of superfluous exactitude. They would, of
course, retain a sample sheet themselves and send rather too many than too few
to South Australia.

The facts set forth above dispel a mystery that has enveloped these stamps
for many years. The story of their discovery is told with admirable completeness
in the Handbook written by Messrs. Napier and Gordon Smith, and it is only
one of many evidences of the thoroughness of their work and the acumen of their
judgment that they intelligently anticipated the fate that actually befell the
unissued 1/- London prints.

The Handbook tells us that "in June 1860 Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. sent
out to the colony the plate for a 9d. value of a different design to those previously
prepared by them." In that different design the vigilant eye of P.M.G. John
Watts is fixed on us. Concerning it the following correspondence takes place :

\begin{letter}

SIR,

With reference to your minute upon my letter of 3ist October conveying
sanction for the procuring of "nine penny" postage stamps, I have now the
honour to enclose a pattern for transmission to the Agent-General in order to his
procuring the requisite plate, and I have also to request that at the same time
Twenty Pounds of the requisite colouring material may be forwarded.

As a very serious mistake occurred upon the last occasion of postage stamps
being ordered through the Agent-General I beg to point out the necessity for great
care being observed both as to the form of stamp and colour of material upon the
present occasion.

I have the honour, etc.,
JOHN WATTS.

\end{letter}


The "pattern" to which reference is made in the Postmaster's letter is in
His Majesty's collection of South Australia. There can be no question that in
recalling the "very serious mistake" that had occurred about the shilling stamp
Mr. Watts had also remembered the attractive oval of the 1/- stamp of Great
Britain to which he had referred in the postscript of his letter of complaint early
in 1857 and that his recollection was the inspiration of the 9d. design. Two
details of some interest crop up about this stamp. One is the preference of the
Chief Secretary for the word "South" instead of the initial " S." Even Jupiter
can nod and even P.M.G. Watts shared mortal frailties. Of course, the Chief
Secretary was quite right, and though his " pattern " remained unaltered, the
"S" in it was duly extended into "South" in the plate.

The other point of interest is mentioned in the Handbook. In the official
notification of the issue of these stamps "Persons posting letters" are advised
to affix them " sometime previous to depositing them in the letter receivers, as
when posted in a damp state the stamps are liable to rub off and thereby cause
the letters to be treated as unpaid. The simplest and most effectual method of
causing stamps to adhere firmly is, first, to moisten well the outside of the stamp,
and afterwards the gummed side slightly, taking care not to remove the gum."
It would appear that Mr. Hore-Belisha has had predecessors who like him have
increased what Mr. Punch calls the " embelishaments " of city life; but though
the authors of the Handbook had never heard of a case of recommending people
to lick a stamp in front to make it sticky behind (the sticky lickings of my boyhood
were always behind),'if they still survive they are probably aware that the same
"grandmotherly solicitude" as they appropriately call it was repeated in
Adelaide concerning the 2d. Crown & A of 1906.

Though P.M.G. Watts retired in 1861 his soul, like John Brown's in America,
went marching on in South Australia. One evidence of his enduring influence
is revealed in the 4d. and 2/- values issued six years later. An indent received
by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. on July 20th, 1866, is reminiscent of the man
whose resignation had taken place almost exactly five years earlier. It reads as
follows : 

\begin{letter}
" Steel plate for 240 Fourpenny stamps to be the same size and design
as the Nova Scotia stamp attached, substituting for the words ' Nova Scotia '
South Australia and for 'Two Cents' Fourpence. Colour same as pattern, fine
dry Lilac 10 lbs." 
\end{letter}

A month later an identical indent was received for a 2/- plate
with a 5 cent Nova Scotia stamp attached and an order for 2 lbs. each of deep-lake scarlet
and deep-lake-crimson both dry. The most conspicuous difference between
the original and the copy is in the background to the Queen's head. In the Nova
Scotian stamps this consists of horizontal lines of varying shade while in the South
Australian issue it is composed of almost solid colour slightly relieved by small
white dots. In the Handbook this background is described by the term " engine
turned." 

The stamps as engraved by Jeens and modified by Perkins, Bacon & Co.
proved so satisfying that so long as these values were printed from such plates
they remained unchanged ; when a 3d. was required their design was adopted
for its use, and the typographed 2d. produced by Messrs. De La Rue & Co. was
an obvious imitation made doubtless at the request of the authorities in Adelaide.

The sole remaining historical note concerns the 4d. watermark Crown & V.
This with the 2d. De La Rue type constitute a curious invasion of S.A. issues
from the neighbouring state of Victoria. The authors of the Handbook surmise
that it took place " early in 1871 or even possibly late in 1870," basing their
conjecture on the improbability of a perforation abandoned at the beginning of
the following year. For some reason or other, possibly pressure on the nj, I2j
machine, these stamps printed on Victorian paper were perforated by the rotary
machine which continued in more or less occasional use for another twenty years.
As to the issue of these stamps it took place, not late in 1870 as the Handbook
suggests, nor late in the following year as Rev. P. E. Raynor supposed, but in
the middle of 1871, the earliest known copy bearing the date July i7th in that
year. The following letter from Mr. (later Sir Charles) Todd, then P.M.G. of
South Australia, to the Deputy P.M.G. of Melbourne dated May i6th, 1871, sets
the matter at rest :

" I have the honour to request if possible you would kindly lend this Depart*
ment say 10 reams of watermarked paper for printing postage stamps, the usual
supply from England having unfortunately not arrived.
The size required for our plates is not less than 21 inches by n inches ... continued emergency issue etc.
