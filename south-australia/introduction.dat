\chapter{South Australia}


SOUTH AUSTRALIA was the latest of the five states which prior
to 1859 comprised the British colonies of Australia to adopt
postage stamps for franking letters. The authorities in Adelaide
were doubtless impelled to take the step on several grounds, one
of which probably was the decision of the New South Wales
Government taken late in 1853 to use stamps for intercolonial
correspondence as well as for letters within its own territory. It would appear
that till then only what may be regarded as local letters were franked by stamps,
those for other colonies, largely conveyed by sea, being paid for over the counters
of the post offices. This, at all events, seems to be implied by the following notice headed:

exceeding 1 oz. 6d., and for each additional ounce or fraction of an ounce two
additional rates. Each colony to retain its own collections. Ship Letters :

Though, however, South Australia was the last of the Colonies to make use
of stamps for postal purposes, it was the first to make no attempt to produce
them for itself. It is true that Western Australia applied to London for its first
penny stamp, which appeared less than six months before the London print 2d.
of S.A., but for all other values it relied for several years on unsightly lithographic
productions of its own. It seems at least possible that artistic considerations
were not altogether absent from the decision reached at Adelaide, for while
Sydney Views and Victorian half-lengths have attained the pinnacle of joys for
ever, no one with the faintest tincture of taste in such matters would accuse such
clumsy creations of being things of beauty.



The decision of the South Australian Government to embark on the issue of
postage stamps for public use was reached apparently early in 1853, for under
date April 1st in that year the Postmaster-General, Mr. John Watts, wrote to the
Colonial Secretary as follows :

\begin{letter}
" With reference to your letter of February 28th last, requesting by desire
of His Excellency the Lt. Governor that I should furnish a specification of the
requisite postage stamps preparatory to the introduction of the system of prepayment
upon all letters posted : I now do myself the honour to enclose a sketch
of a stamp (not enclosed now) similar to that in use in England with the addition
in order to adapt it to this colony of the words ' South Australia.' As respects
the rate (2d.), I beg to observe that should that be continued as at present the
lowest rate in use in this Colony, anoVthe ship and inland to be fixed at a multiple
of 2d., it will be unnecessary to order dies of any other value. Being totally
unacquainted with the arrangements necessary for the carrying out of the system
of prepayment of postage by stamps and of the printing and sale of them, I
referred to the proceedings appointed . . . for the purpose of enquiring into and
reporting upon the management of the Post Office Department of New South
Wales ; and therein I find it has been deemed requisite to procure a press for the
purpose of having the stamps struck off under the immediate control of an officer
appointed for that purpose, by whom they are issued to the Postmaster-General
upon his requisition. I am not aware that I can afford any further information
upon this subject, but I would suggest that when the plate, press and obliterating
stamps are ordered from England one million of stamps be at the same time
ordered which will enable the proposed system to be carried into immediate effect
without the delay consequent upon the providing of an apartment etc., for the
setting up and working of the press."
\end{letter}

There are several matters of interest in the above letter to which reference might be made. The picture which it presents of members of what in spite of
high-sounding titles and designations must have been a somewhat primitive
community tackling a big and novel undertaking is a vivid and attractive one.
The provision of "an apartment etc.," for printing plant and operations tickles
the fancy of anyone familiar With the luxurious appointments of a modern " apartment
" in a city like New York. One speculates what the sketch " not now
enclosed " and similar to stamps " in use in England " was like. But the most
interesting feature of an interesting letter is the explanation which it supplies
for the curious fact that only 2d. stamps and their appurtenances were ordered
from London, and its naive suggestion that if country and interstate letter rates
were made in multiples of 2d. none but stamps of that value would ever be required.
It may be remarked in passing that the 2d. rate lasted in South Australia for nearly
sixty years and that until 1912 it cost as much to post a letter from one part of
Adelaide to another as it did to frank one to this country, and the rate was
Mr. P.M.G. Watts's twopence !

None the less, his dream of a self-sufficing twopenny stamp did not command
the consent of other authorities, for on January 25th, 1854, he again addresses
the Hon. Colonial Secretary in the following terms :

\begin{letter}
" SIR,

" In carrying into effect the recently enacted Local Post Office Act it
will be requisite to procure from England dies of postage stamps of the rates
respectively of sixpence and one penny, patterns for which I have now the honour
to enclose, and I would at the same time beg to recommend that half a million
of the stamps at the first-named rate, 6d. and two hundred thousand of the latter
rate, id. be ordered together with the following articles as suggested by Mr. Cox,
the Government Printer, viz. : paper of the proper quality sufficient for 5,000,000
of stamps ; 12 Ibs. blue printers' ink ; 12 Ibs. green ; 12 Ibs. red, all best quality."
And he further suggests " that the plates should be secured in duplicate which I
would recommend for those now ordered, as also for the two penny stamps
formerly ordered, should such precaution be deemed necessary by the Colonial
Agent on his advising with competent persons in England."
\end{letter}

The stamps and other necessaries must have been promptly ordered, but that
some hitch occurred in their production and delivery is evident from Parliamentary
paper, No. 35, dated August 15th, 1855. " Governor complaining non receipt
of 500,000 6d. and 200,000 1d. stamps ordered in January, 1854," subscribed
Richard Graves MacDonnell, Governor.

As a matter of fact the stamps were ordered towards the end of August 1853 (De Worms, p.133) together with an order for postage stamps for Van Diemen's Land and Victoria. (See De Worms, p.103). 

Bacon at the time tendered to supply the postage labels and other items for the sum of \pound340 7s 8d. and to deliver them within 16 weeks from the date of the order. The Tender was accepted on the 14th September 1853. The South Australia Twopence stamps were invoiced in April 1854.

\end{figure}

The second requisition in April 1854 called for One Penny and Sixpenny stamps. This time the cost was tendered aas \pound320 8d 8d. with a delivery time of 13 weeks from date of order.

The order was accepted on pril 22, 1854, but the plates were not sent to the colony until June 1855. 

The firm were so long in completing the order that Barnard wrote them this letter:

\begin{letter}
I have to enclose a copy of a letter from the Government of South Australia complaining of teh very long delay which you have caused by the non-supply of teh Postage Stamps before the month of June last whenn they were shipped P 'Victoria' and to request taht you will furnish me with the necessary explanation.
