\chapter{1871 Emergency Issue on Victorian V/Crown Paper}
The sole remaining historical note concerns the 4d. watermark Crown & V.
This with the 2d. De La Rue type constitute a curious invasion of S.A. issues
from the neighbouring state of Victoria. The authors of the Handbook surmise
that it took place" early in 1871 or even possibly late in 1870," basing their
conjecture on the improbability of a perforation abandoned at the beginning of
the following year. For some reason or other, possibly pressure on the 11\half by 12\half
machine, these stamps printed on Victorian paper were perforated by the rotary
machine which continued in more or less occasional use for another twenty years.

As to the issue of these stamps it took place, not late in 1870 as the Handbook
suggests, nor late in the following year as Rev. P. E. Raynor supposed, but in
the middle of 1871, the earliest known copy bearing the date July 17th in that
year. The following letter from Mr. (later Sir Charles) Todd, then P.M.G. of
South Australia, to the Deputy P.M.G. of Melbourne dated May 16th, 1871, sets
the matter at rest :

" I have the honour to request if possible you would kindly lend this Depart*
ment say 10 reams of watermarked paper for printing postage stamps, the usual
supply from England having unfortunately not arrived.
The size required for our plates is not less than 21 inches by 11 inches."

Five books =5000 sheets were forwarded to Adelaide per " Penola " on
June 1st, 1871, and P.M.G. Adelaide so advised.

On April 13th, 1872, P.M.G. Adelaide stated that they had received a supply
of paper 21 in. long and nj in. wide and could return ten reams of paper or
pay cash.

The paper not being suitable to the Victorian Department, Â£25 12s. fid. was
paid by the Adelaide authorities for the paper borrowed.

(Particulars from W. R. Rundell to F. C. Krichauff, July 6th, 1932.)
It seems a pity that the South Australian paper did not suit the people in
Melbourne, since had they been able to adapt it to their needs we should have
Victorian parities with Broad Star watermarks. Such are the unfulfilled possibilities
of Philately.
