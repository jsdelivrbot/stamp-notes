# 1931 The 900th Anniversary of the Montserrat Monastery

The legend locates the discovery of the image of the Virgin of Montserrat to 880. 1 Then began the cult of Black Madonna , which materialized in first four chapels in the ninth century Santa Maria, San Acisclo, San Pedro and San Martin . 

However, the origin of the monastery is uncertain: it is known that around 1011, a monk from the monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll came to the mountain to take care of the monastery of Santa Cecilia , thus leaving the monastery under the orders of the abbot Oliba Ripoll. Santa Cecilia did not accept this new situation, so Oliva decided to found the monastery of Santa Maria in the place where an ancient chapel of the same name (1025) was. From 1082, Santa Maria passed to have own abbot and let depend on the abbot of Ripoll. This hermitage had become the most important of all that existed in the mountain thanks to the image of the Virgin in her venerated from the 880.
