# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Spain

Luis Eugénio Ferreira in "\textit{A certain Look at Philately}" wrote: "In a broad sense, all stamps are historical documents and philately, the branch of knowledge that studies postal stamps
and/or studies all forms of franking used in the postal service, is clearly an auxiliary science of History". It is difficult to study the stamps of Spain without recourse to the historical events around them, so in these notes I have provided historical commentary  where appropriate and I hope to raise your interest in both the stamps and history of Spain.


Spain issued its first stamps in January 1850 ten years after the first stamp was issued in Great Britain and became the twelfth country of the World to issue adhesive stamps for the prepayment of letter postage.

Almost all of the postage stamps of Spain, issued between 1850 and 1869, show the profile of Queen Isabella II.

Queen Isabella II (1830-1904) of the House of Bourbon was only three-years-old, when she ascended to the Spanish throne.  Her accession was contested by the Carlists, who did not recognize the sovereignty of a female monarch.  Her reign survived as long as it did, primarily through the support of the army.  This resulted in what are called the Carlist Wars, a series of civil wars fought between 1833 and 1876.  As a result of the Carlist Wars, Isabella II was overthrown in 1868, and she formally abdicated in 1870.



The five definitive Spanish stamps shown above were issued on January 1, 1850.  They are lithographed, unwatermarked, imperforate, and they are all inscribed "1850" at the bottom.
