# Definitive Stamps of 1870-1874


For definitive Spanish stamps, this was a transitional period between the provisional government and the re-establishment of the Bourbon monarchy.


# Regency

The leaders of the Provisional Government that overthrew Queen Isabella II did not have the intention of completely abolishing the monarchy.  Their vision was of a constitutional monarchy with both a popularly elected parliament and a popularly elected monarch.  Of course, this was never going to succeed!

Don Francisco Serrano y Dominguez, the First Duke of La Torre, Military Commander of Spain, also known as General Francisco Serrano (1810-1885), was the Prime Minister of the Provisional Military Government during 1868 and 1869, and he was the Regent of Spain from June 18, 1869 to September 27, 1870.  His rule was impartial and he always respected the independence of the Spanish legislature (Cortes Generales).
