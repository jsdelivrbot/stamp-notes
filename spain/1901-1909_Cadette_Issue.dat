# 1901-1909 Cadette Issue 241-255

This issue generally consists of 12 values from 2 céntimos up to 10 pesetas. The 15 cts and the 40 cts value stamps were printed in different colours/shades so that at least there exist 15 main numbers in the catalogues. One fact that makes them quite interesting for collectors: They are the first Spanish stamps with control numbers on the reverse side (cifras de control). Also, they show some retouches, especially with the 15 cts value.
