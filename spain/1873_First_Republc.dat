# First Republic 1873-74


Following the abdication of King Amadeo I, the Spanish legislature declared the First Republic of Spain on February 11, 1873.  The short-lived republic was characterized by political and social instability and by violence, and the republic collapsed at the end of December 1874.

For a wonder, the official announcement
of a new series has been
promptly followed by the
apparition of the stamps
themselves. It would have
been too much to expect
that any strikingly original
type could have been conceived
and engraved in the
short space of time which
has followed the abdication
of King Amadeus. The officials have had
recourse to the Cuban type of 1871, and
have fitted it for service at home, as will
be seen by our engraving, by simply substituting
comunicaciones for " Ultramar,
1871," and espana, on either side, for
"Correos." Nothing could have been simpler.
The values and colours hitherto
received are as follows

and there are, no doubt, more to come, but
this instalment will, we presume, meet the
most pressing requirements of
the service, and satisfy the
Iutransigentes, to whom anything
that savours of royalty
is unclean. The j cent de
peseta remains in service, but
the royal crown has made
way for a mural one,—as per our illustration—
and the stamp is printed bright

The next issue had Espana replaced with "Justice" and was issued in ten denominations.
