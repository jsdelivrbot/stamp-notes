# The Pelón issue (1889-1899)

In November 1885, Alfonso XII died, just short of his 28th birthday, at the Royal Palace of El Pardo. He had been suffering from tuberculosis, but the immediate cause of his death was a recurrence of dysentery.

His son Alfonso XII was born six months later in Madrid on 17 May 1886  and became King of Spain upon his birth. The French newspaper Le Figaro described the young king in 1889 as "the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth". His mother, Maria Christina of Austria, served as his regent until his 16th birthday. During the regency, in 1898, Spain lost its colonial rule over [Cuba](../cuba/Introduction), [Puerto Rico](../puerto-rico/Introduction), [Guam](../guam/Introduction) and the [Philippines](../philippines/Introduction) to the United States as a result of the Spanish–American War.

When he came of age in May 1902, the week of his majority was marked by festivities, bullfights, balls and receptions throughout Spain.


## The Stamps

 The stamps issued with his portrait on October 1, 1889, do show him as a little three year-old boy which looks quite bald-headed - "pelón" in Spanish. This issue generally consists of 13 values from 2 céntimos up to 10 pesetas. In 1899, the values of the 2 cts, the 5 cts and the 10 cts stamps were printed in new UPU colours so that at least there are 16 main numbers in the catalogues. A stamp for official use in the Pelón design, a yellow 15 cts value, was issued in 1895. 

The Pelón issue generally is poorly centered and mostly shows bad perforations. Due to the longtime use of this series, many tones and paper qualities exist, which maybe of interest for specialized collectors. Only the 15 cts, 25cts and 1 peseta stamp show secret marks made by the engraver, Eugenio Juliá Jover. The official "announcement sheet" containing the complete set of the Pelón serie can be viewed here. It was sent to the post offices before the new stamps were introduced. There is no official data available for this issue concerning the actual print run. Valid through 31.08.1901, this issue could have been used together with the Cadete stamps issued on January 1, 1901, for eight months. Although this seems to be a relatively long time, mixed frankings of Pelón and Cadete stamps are somewhat harder to find.

Alfonso XIII, born after his father's death on May 17, 1886, three days later was declared king of Spain under the regency of his mother, Queen María Cristina. He attained his majority in 1902 and reigned Spain until April 14, 1931. During this long time, five series of definitive stamps with his portrait were issued: Pelón (bald head) 1889-1900; Cadete (Cadet) 1901-1909; Medallón 1909-1923; Vaquer I 1922-1930 and Vaquer II 1930/31. The last issue also exists overprinted "República Española" 1931/32. The Pelón issue was valid until August 31, 1901.

# The Pelón issue - secret marks

The 15 cts, 25cts and 1 peseta values do show secret marks by the engraver, Eugenio Juliá Jover. These marks consist of several broken letters in the top and the bottom cartouches of the stamps - sometimes they could be found all together and sometimes there are some of them missing, depending on their plate positions. The images of the secret marks is from
