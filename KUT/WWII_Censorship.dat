In 1920 the B.E.A. Protectorate was raised to the status of a Crown Colony under the title Kenya Colony.

The strip of land along the coast, approximately 10 miles wide, with the islands of lamu, Manda, 
Patta and Siwa retained their status as Kenya
Protectorate.

The name Kenya is derived from the native name of Mount kenya __Kilinyaa__ the white mountain.

In 1924 the districts of Juba River and Kismayo were ceded to Italy and became {{wi: Jubaland}}.
