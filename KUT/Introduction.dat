In 1920 the B.E.A. Protectorate was raised to the status of a Crown Colony under the title Kenya Colony.

The strip of land along the coast, approximately 10 miles wide, with the islands of lamu, Manda, 
Patta and Siwa retained their status as Kenya
Protectorate.

The name Kenya is derived from the native name of Mount kenya __Kilinyaa__ the white mountain.

In 1924 the districts of Juba River and Kismayo were ceded to Italy and became {{wi: Jubaland}}.

###Postal History

Stamps cancelled Sereuli, Alexandria, Afmandu, Brikau, Fort Dunford should be sought after as these were
the districts that became Jubaland.

campaign letters written during actions taken against the Abyssinian slave traders are scarce. In 1926 these traders were driven into Italian Somaliland, where heavy
fighting took place. In 1929 the Abyssinians raided kenya on 140 occassions with some small success and again in 1932, although this year they got such a
drubbing from the British African troops that the aggravation was abated to a mere occassional nuisance.

Hong Kong formerly produced postage stamps with the name Hong Kong, with the face of the reigning monarchs of the United Kingdom, or with the royal symbols (e.g. "E.R."). After the Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty to China, stamps are now issued with the name Hong Kong, China. British Hong Kong postage stamps are no longer valid for prepayment of postage or repurchased by the Post Office.

The postal system in Hong Kong began in 1841 when the Royal Mail established an office in the region. Merchants were trading in Hong Kong at the two sides of Victoria Harbour for some years before the establishment of the British possession in 1842. They had complained about the absence of proper postal services and therefore the Postal Department was established.

On 8 December 1862, the Office isssued the first set of Hong Kong postal stamps. Before that, only British soldiers in Hong Kong could use British stamps while other local residents did not have any.

Until the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, BFPO 1 was the address for British forces serving in the former colony. When sending mail from the UK to a member of HM Forces serving overseas, the sender must address it to the appropriate BFPO number, and
 not to the country in which that person is based. BFPO1 addressed mail was charged at the inland UK rate.
