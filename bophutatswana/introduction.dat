\section{Bophuthatswana, Stamps and Postal History}

Bophuthatswana (meaning "gathering of the Tswana people"),[1] officially the 
Republic of Bophuthatswana (Tswana: Repaboleki ya Bophuthatswana; Afrikaans: 
Republiek van Bophuthatswana), was a bantustan ("homeland"; an area set aside for members of a specific ethnicity) and nominal parliamentary democracy in the 
northwestern 
region of South Africa. Its seat of government was Mmabatho.

Historically, Bophuthatswana's significance is twofold: it was the first area to be declared an independent state whose territory constituted a scattered patchwork of individual enclaves, and during its last days of existence, events taking place 
within its borders led to the weakening and split of right-winged Afrikaner 
resistance towards democratizing South Africa.

In 1994, it was reintegrated into South Africa, and its territory was distributed 
among the new provinces of the Orange Free State (now Free State), Northern 
Cape, and North West Province.

Mafeking briefly served as capital of the pre-independence Bantustan of Bophuthatswana in the 1970s, before the adjoining town of Mmabatho was established as capital.
Following the end of apartheid in 1994, Mahikeng---as Mafikeng is now known---and Mmabatho were merged and instated as capital of the new North-West Province.

Bophutatswana ceased to exist on the 27 April 1974, when the new South Africa was born. It did manage during its short history to issue 302 stamps. Its stamps are very well printed and attractive. The stamps are not very common on cover although FDCs are very common.
