# The Fist Stamps of Wurttemberg

THE FIRST ISSUE.
The Government of Wurtemberg obtained
control of its own postal service
in 1851 when, as I have already shown
in my preceding notes, it was purchased
from the Prince of Thurn and Taxis.

The first series of stamps consisting of
1, 3, 6 and 9 kreuzer values were placed
on sale to the public on the 12th October,
1851, though their use for postal
purposes did not commence until three
days later. 

In April, 1852, a new denomination
18 kreuzer was added to
the set and as the design is similar to
that of the lower values, all can best be
treated as one set. To quote the late
Mr. W. A. S. Westoby: 

"The resemblance
between the stamps of the first
series of Wurtemberg and those of the
first series of Baden is so remarkable as
to leave no doubt that the Government
of Wurtemberg availed itself of the results
of the investigations made by that
of Baden previously to the issue of the
first series for this latter State, on May
1st, 1851. 

The dies were similarly constructed,
the inscriptions were similar,
mutatis mutandis, and the stamps were
printed on colored paper. The matrix
die was composite, the numeral of value
in the center being within a frame, almost
square, of 9^ mm. placed angle
upwards within a frame measuring externally
22 1/2 by 22 mm. and internally
15 1/2 by 15 mm. and carrying the following
inscriptions on tablets : 

In the upper
one, running the whole width, was
'Wurttemberg,' and on a similar tablet at
the foot was 'Freimarke/ with an ornament
at each end resembling a vine
branch with the two bunches of grapes,
the lower one of which was incomplete.
On the tablet on the left side was'Deutsch-
Oestr. Postverein,' and on another on the right side 'Vertrag v. 6 April 1850.
These were set up in movable type, the
upper and lower ones in ordinary German
lower case characters with capital
initials, and those on the sides in diamond
type, as in those of Baden. The spaces
between the rectangle carrying the numeral
of value and the inner line of the
frame were filled in with arabesque ornaments."
The design is similar for all values
with the exception of the central portion
carrying the numerals. In the case of
the 1 and 6 kreuzer the background is
composed of lines running parallel to
the sides of the rectangle making a design
of small squares; in the 3 kreuzer,
the ground consists of small ovals; in
the 9 kreuzer the ground is composed
of small circles resembling lace work;
while on the 18 kreuzer the background
is formed of horizontal lines.
The dies were engraved at the Mint
in Stuttgart, where the electrotypes composing
the printing plates were also
made. The printing was done under the
direction of the post office, in typographic
presses, the sheets consisting of
sixty stamps arranged in ten rows of six.
All denominations were printed in black
on colored papers. The paper was obtained
locally and while it is always wove,
it varies considerably in thickness and
most values provide numerous shades.
The stamps were all issued imperforate.
Mr. Westoby tells us that, "It may be
noted that occasionally one or both of
the full stops are wanting after the 'v'
or the '6' in the inscription in the right
tablet of the 3 kreuzer, and there is a
difference in the position of the stop
after the word 'Postverein' in the left
tablet. The first of these is probably
due to imperfections in the moulds from
which the electrotypes were made, while
the second points to the making of new
plates."

Mr. Robert Ehrenbach, writing in the
London Philatelist for August, 1893,
points out that differences in the position
of the period after "Postverein"
may be found in all values except the
18kr. There are three types in all. In
Type I the period is between the second
and third points of the zigzag lines of
the border; in type II it is exactly over
the second point; and in type III it is
exactly above the third point. All three
types are found on the 3 kreuzer, types
I and II are found in the 1, 6 and 9
kreuzer, while the ISkr is known only
with the first type. Whether the varieties
are found side by side on the same
sheet or are the distinguishing points
of separate plates we are not told.
