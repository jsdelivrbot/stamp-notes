# 1857 Postage Stamp Issue

Although it is obvious that the design
of Wurtemberg's first stamps was inspired
by the numeral series for Baden,
it was not long befoie more original
ideas prevailed and an entirely new
series of stamps was issued. The new
design shows the Arms of the kingdom,
with supporters and motto, embossed
in colorless relief on a ground work
of color covered with white horizontal
loops. This is contained within a rectangular
frame, measuring 22^ mm.
square, which is inscribed "FREIMARKE"
at the top and with the value
on each of the other three sides. The
inscriptions are all in Roman capitals
and the design is completed by the addition
of small six-rayed stars in each
of the angles. An excellent description of
the Arms design appeared in Gibbons'
Stamp Weekly for September 5th, 1908,
which I cannot do better than reproduce
:
In 1817, King William of Wurtemberg
simplified the Arms of the
kingdom, the proper arms of the royal
house having become too complicated
through additions at various times.
The arms now consist of an oval
shield divided into two parts or fields,
surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves,
in gold, surmounted by a gold helmet
bearing a royal crown.

The two fields are:
On the right, for Wurtemberg, three
stag's antlers, in black, placed one
upon the other, on a golden field; the
upper antlers having each four points,
the lower one but three. These are
the original arms of the counts of
Wurtemberg, and have reference to
their office of Hereditary Grand
Huntsman.
On the left, for Swabia, three blaJc
lions, one above the other, also on a
golden field; the lions have their
tongues hanging out of their mouths,
and their right paws are raised. These
are the three lions of Hohenstauffen,
and were only added to the arms of
Wurtemberg in 1806 by King Frederick,
in memory of the famous family
of Hohenstauffen, which, in former
times occupied the country which
now forms Wurtemberg.
The supporters of the shield are,
on the right, a black lion bearing a
golden crown; and on the left, a
golden stag. The proper colors for
the ribbon bearing the motto are
purple with a black reverse, and the
motto itself, in gold letters, reads
"Furchtloss und treie," i. e. "Fearless
and true."

The design is the same for all denominations,
varying only in the designation
of value. The dies were engraved
and the electrotypes made at the
Mint in Stuttgart. The printing form
for each value consisted of sixty electrotypes,
arranged in ten rows of six,
which were separated as a rule by a
space of only Y^ mm.

The paper varies considerably in thickness
and that at first employed contains
orange colored silk threads similar
to the "Dickinson" paper, found in connection
with some of the early British
stamps. These silk threads were so
placed that they traversed the stamps in
a horizontal direction, one thread being
apportioned to each horizontal row of
stamps. This paper was apparently obtained
from Bavaria.


The values in this new series corresponded
exactly to those previously in
use, the set being issued on Sept. 22nd,
1857, according to Mr. Westoby, Mr.
Ehrenbach, and other writers on the
subject. In the Monthly Journal some
few years ago a copy of the 9kr was
reported with cancellation dated Dec.
30th, 1856, and on the strength of this
Gibbons' catalogue assigns the date December,
1856, to the whole series. This
seems particularly slender evidence on
which to antedate the whole issue by
some nine months for the cancellation
might easily have been an error for
1857. We should like to hear of other
early dated specimens before accepting
1856 as the correct date of issue.
Most of the stamps of this set vary
in shade but these variations are not
very striking being, as a rule, confined
to pale and deep tints.
