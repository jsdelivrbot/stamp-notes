THE THIRD ISSUE.
If we accept the date of September,
1857, as correct for the second issue the
use of the silk-thread paper lasted but
a very short time for in June, 1858,
the stamps began to appear on whitewove
machine made paper, without
threads. This paper is usually fairly
thick but, like that of the preceding issue,
it varies in texture. The sheets
contained sixty stamps as before but the
electrotypes were re-arranged so that
the spaces between them varied from
 1/2 mm. to 1/4 mm.

An interesting variety of the Ikr of
this issue is described in the Monthly
Journal for September, 1904, viz :
"Mr. Giwelb has shown our publishers
a copy of the 1 kreuzer with a clear impression
on the back reading the right
way. Probably a sheet that was defective
in some part of the impression was
passed through the press again, for the
sake of economy, but it is not the silk
thread paper. The specimen is postmarked
Stuttgart, 1 Jun 1867."

The stamps of this issue are almost
exactly like the corresponding stamps on
the silk thread paper and variations in
shade are of little consequence with the
exception of the Ikr. This value exists
in two very striking shades of brown
one being yellowish and the other almost
a black-brown.
