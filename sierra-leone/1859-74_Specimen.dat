\section{Sierra Leone}

For years the origin of the 6d. Sierra Leone die had been a mystery but the publication
of the De La Rue records has solved this problem as well as many others. It now appears
that around the middle of the 19th Century De La Rue engraved master dies of the Queen's
head from which a number of punches were made. Before these punches were hardened the lines of the diadem could easily be cut away from the soft steel and any other necessary
working up done. The punches would then be hardened and used to produce secondary
dies without detail on the diadem which the engravers could add together with a frame to
suit any particular colony. The original Colonial Head used for Sierra Leone first issue
was produced in this way.\cite{MacMillan, H.B, Sierra Leone, London Philatelist, 1962.}

The Sierra Leone 6d. plate was made up of 12 panes each of 20 stamps - a total of 240.
These were the first Colonial stamps printed by De La Rue and they seem to have followed
the sheet make up of the British stamps. They were perforated at Somerset House with a
14 gauge comb perforator which provided a single vertical perforation between the panes
thus leaving a number of stamps with wing margins.

The first printing made in June 1859 was 100 sheets, 24,000 stamps, the colour being dull
purple. Most of these stamps seem to be on bluish paper and Gibbons list those on white
and those on bluish paper as distinct varieties. I am, however, firmly of the opinion that
no such line can be drawn. In 1859 De La Rue were in correspondence with the Stamp Office
on this very subject of paper becoming blue or being defaced by blue spots. Warren De
La Rue blamed the paper makers (Turner & Co. of Chafford Mills) and stated that the
bluing of the paper was due to the decomposition of prussiate of potash which was included
in the paper for security purposes. The decomposition was, he thought, due to the existence
of small quantities of free chlorine or chloride of lime in the pulp. I shall refer to this bluing
again but I think we can take it that the first printing of 100 sheets was made on white paper
which went blue to varying degrees as the prussiate of potash decomposed. Dated copies of
these early stamps are very scarce but we are able to establish the colour of the first printing
from two covers which I am showing. These are dated 1861 and 1864 whereas the second
printing (25,680 stamps) was not invoiced until August 1865. We cannot be sure what colour
this second printing was but I suggest it was grey lilac and I show two covers dated 1869 and
1871 to support this

The third printing was invoiced in November 1871 and amounted to 20,640 stamps. This
was perforated 12\half and from a cover dated 17.7.72 we can now see that the colour was
bright violet. Probably the small printing of 28 sheets invoiced in May 1873 was in dull
purple.

I believe that only these two printings were perforated 12\half and that the printing in
February 1874 reverted to 14 perforation. My evidence is only circumstantial as dated
copies of these stamps are almost unknown and covers are scarce. We know however from
De La Rue records that 141,360 6d. stamps were invoiced in seven printings prior to the
reduction in price to Is. 4d. per 1,000 which took effect when the Crown Agents supplied
the paper which was watermarked C.C. We also know that stamps perforated 14 are much
commoner than those perforated 12\half. In my collection the rate is about 5 to 1 and if my
assumption that there were only two printings perforated 12\half is correct, we have figures
of 114,000 perforation 14 against 27,360 perforation 12Â£. I cannot in fact believe that there could be a much greater proportion of perforation 12 \half.
