\chapter{1884 Issue}    

In 1884 Sierra Leone changed the colours of its postage stamps
to fall in line with the UPU standards. The four new stamps
were printed on Crown CA paper: 1/2d light green, 1d carmine, 2d grey and 4d 
brown.

There are four other values as listed by catalogues, but these were not printed until
1888-1891: 1\halfd, 2\halfd 3d and 1s. All the stamps are known overprinted with the word \textsc{specimen}. The first values printed on 15 May 1884 were the first of
any British Colony stamps to be overprinted \textsc{specimen} by De La Rue before they were sent to the UPU. A total of 100 stamps were distributed with the International
Bureau circular dated 18 June 1884.    

It was in the same year that the first Specimen stamps were supplied to the UPU as per 
their regulations.
