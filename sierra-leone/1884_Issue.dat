In 1884 Sierra Leone changed the colours of its postage stamps
to fall in line with the UPU standards. The four new stamps
were printed on Crown CA paper: 1/2d light green, 1d carmine, 2d grey and 4d 
brown.  


The question of establishing a general scheme for the colours of colonial postage stamps was the subject of correspondence between the Crown Agents and De La Rue in 1883. The Company prepared a colour chart for Sierra Leone which was approved on 22 October 1883\footnote{DLRH page 389}, and supplies of the \halfd, 1d, 2d, and 4d
in the new colours were invoiced on 15 May 1884. Over 1,000 sheets (60 multiples) each of the Halfpenny, One Penny, Twopence and Fourpence were invoiced.

Copies of these overprinted SPECIMEN were distributed with the International Bureau circular of 19 June 1884, and were the first colonials so overprinted by De La Rue for Universal Postal Union purposes. One hundred copies of each were
required. Supplies of each of these overprinted values included some abnormally perforated 12, and it
seems possible that after the May despatches to the Colony De La Rue were left with insufficient
stock for the purpose so had to make up the balance by perforating a small number of proofs with a line 12 machine. Illustrated is a 6d without the overprint but with a similar perforation (figure 10).
None of the 6d were issued on the Crown CA paper so I assume that this was from a trial printing.
An example of this stamp is in Her Majesty the Queen's collection and I believe another copy was
included with sections of the colour scheme sold at auction in November 1976.

Examples of the 2 1/2 d, 6d, and Is overprinted SPECIMEN (types D12 and D12x) are shown, with
copies of the Id, 1 1/2 d, and 1s diagonally handstamped. Marcus Samuel records most of the 1884 issue with the SPECIMEN handstamp and suggests that it was applied locally, probably for presentation
purposes (figure 11.)
