\chapter{1872-73 Issue}
In the meantime in 1872 four additional values 1d., 3d., 4d. and  1s. were added in a new
design --- a design which is very reminiscent of the 96 cent [Straits Settlements](../straits-settlements/Introduction) stamp of the same period. This issue too provides us with a few mysteries as yet unsolved. 

The first
printing of the new design was invoiced on the 21st February, 1872, and was on paper with
Crown C.C. watermark and perforated 1. Further printings were invoiced in June 1872
and May 1873 also perforated 124. It is generally accepted that the first two printings had
the watermark sideways and that the third printing had the usual upright watermark,
although we cannot be certain that all values of any particular printing had the watermark
the same way round. Catalogue values generally support the theory that there was only one
printing with upright watermark perforated 124r although the Is. value seems undercatalogued
on the basis of numbers printed.

Why some of these stamps were printed on paper
with sideways watermark I cannot explain, but from what we know of the paper supplies
the panes could have been cut with watermark either way with equal ease. The first C.C.
Watermark dandy roll was 22" circumference and was for a reel width equal to three sheets
of paper, that is three sheets approximately 22" x 11". The panes of 60 Sierra Leone stamps
required paper approximately 11" x 5-J-" so that the sheets could have been cut into four
with two right angle cuts giving upright watermark or three parallel cuts giving sideways
watermark. Whether this was left to the discretion of the guillotine operator or not I suppose
we shall never know, but some stamps of all four values were printed with sideways watermark,
and it seems probable that two printings were involved. I think I am correct in saying
that similar varieties occur in other colonies around this period. The 3d. 1873 with upright
watermark is the well known saffron yellow, a highly catalogued stamp but not particularly
scarce. Scott lists two shades of this stamp one under 1873 and the other 1876. This I am
sure is an error. The 1876 printing was almost certainly perforated 14.
