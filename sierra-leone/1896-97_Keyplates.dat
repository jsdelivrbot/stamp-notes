\chapter{1896-97 Keyplates} 

In 1896 orders were given to print a new series from the Postage and Revenue keyplate which had first been used for the [Gold Coast](../gold-coast/introduction) high values in 1889. It appears from the De La Rue records that on 15 April 1896, they submitted a colour scheme in the form of imperforate trials of the 6d and a £1 value with the Country painted in by hand (7 were shown), and the scheme was approved on 22 April.

On 3 September 1896, the 1d, 2d, 2 1/2d, 3d, Is, 2s, 5s, and £1 were invoiced, but on 13 November the Crown Agents asked for a greater distinction between the l 1/2 d and 5d and, the 3d and 6d values.

Alternatives were submitted in December with the name tablet blank and 6d in violet (lined), olivegreen (lined) and in green (plain). The records include under 12 January 1897, five colour trials of the 2d with lined tablets in colours for values up to 2 1/2d.
