In 1897 a shortage of 1d and 2 \half d stamps led to the 1d revenue stamp being overprinted 'Postage and Revenue', and the revenue 3d, 6d, Is and 2s stamps also being overprinted '2£d'. John Marriott dealt with these very fully in his comments on Her Majesty the Queen's Sierra Leone shown to the Royal Philatelic Society of London in 1969, but H .B. Macmillan suggests that the provisionals may have originated as much from a
desire to use up surplus revenue stamps as to alleviate a genuine shortage.\footnote{LP1025}



John Marriott in his write up on the Royal Display noted these are not very
popular stamps because they are rather unattractive and also they may strike some people
as being rather unnecessary, at any rate as regards the differences in denomination of the
basic stamp.

The colour of the 1s. and 2s. fiscals is also against them, especially those of the 1s.
denomination which were dropped in the sea, and where the colour has run.

However, their issue certainly seems to have been prompted by a shortage of Id. and 2 1/2d.
stamps and in that respect at any rate it is a perfectly valid and collectable issue.

It is worth recording that the first announcement of these stamps in THE LONDON
PHILATELIST reads as follows: 'We regret exceedingly having to chronicle a long list of
fiscal postals and surcharges which have appeared in this otherwise upright colony.'
One reason for my handing round the examples of these surcharges is so that you can see
them at close quarters and inspect some of the varieties that occur. Also that you may have
beside you details of the settings and can therefore appreciate how the examples of the
double surcharges arose and also appreciate how rare some of the different types of surcharge
are.

For the quantities surcharged, we rely on the Acting Colonial Postmaster-General's
letter of 25th October, 1897 to Mr W. L. Chew in which he gives the quantities issued and
sold as 240 sheets of Id.; 74 of 2\half d. on 3d.; 98 of 2id. on 6d.; 35i of 2\half d. on 1s. and 2 of 2-Jd. on 2s. saying that 'sheets were of 120 stamps', and not 60. If we assume his total number of stamps to be correct, this makes Id.: 28,800; 2\half d. on 3d.: 8,880; 2\half d. on 6d.: 11,760; 2 1/2 d. on Is.: 4,260; 2 1/2d. on 2s.: 240. (THE LONDON PHILATELIST Nov. 1897 Vol. 6, p. 322.)

The overprint plate in the case of the Id. and the surcharge plates for the 2\half d. values were
set up in three rows of ten, so that it required two applications to cover the sheet of sixty
stamps. You will see examples of the Id. on the first page; there are some minor varieties
here, but generally speaking the overprint form was carefully set up. However, you will
find the double overprint. This is a rather unusual double in that, for some reason, the sheet
was fed in rather off-centre to the right so that the overprint extended into the margin
on the left-hand side. It must, therefore, have left the stamps down the right-hand side of the sheet without the overprint. In correcting this, an overlap was made with those already
overprinted, with the result that some stamps received the overprint twice. You will find
a horizontal strip of six on display showing the overprint in the left-hand margin, and also
the sixth stamp showing the overprint double.

There is one other interesting aspect of the settings of these surcharges. The first supply
must have consisted only of 2\half d. on 3d. and 2\half d. on 6d. The setting is the same for each of these two values and I have for your inspection a complete setting in the shape of a block of thirty of these 2\half d. on 6d. However, for the 2 1/2d. on 1s. and 2 1/2d. on 2s. the setting is different.

}

The type was presumably broken up in between the two printings and re-set. We can
find a number of pieces of type common to the two settings and in this respect there is a
good deal of similarity.

You will appreciate the extreme rarity of some of the 2\half dd. on 2s. values when you realise
that type b and type f only occur once in thirty stamps and as only 240 were printed there
can only be eight examples of these two stamps.

There are some double surcharges of the 2\half d. on 3d. caused by an overlap between the
bottom row of one group and the top row of the next group. It is curious that no corresponding pairs exist one with and one without the surcharge which one would expect from this
arrangement.

It is possible, however, that the missing surcharges were put in later, or that the row was detached from the sheet, while the double surcharges were allowed to go through and be
issued. It is likely that there was only one occurrence of this doubling since the numbers
known of the double surcharges correspond with a single overlap with a row of type a
surcharges on top of two type a, five of type c, two of type d, and only one of type e. 

This latter, with a type a and type e, is on display this afternoon and is an example of a truly unique stamp.

I need not detain you further with these surcharges except to point out one or two
interesting further varieties, namely the bar inserted by hand in pen and ink on the 2\half d. on 6d. value, and also the sloping N in Revenue in the 2\half d. on 1s. Needless to say very few collections have had a complete showing of the 2 1/2d. on 2s. value, such as you see this
afternoon.
