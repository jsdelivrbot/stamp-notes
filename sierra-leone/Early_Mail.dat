Pressure of public opinion against the slave trade was growing in the eighteenth century, and led in 1787 to the acquisition for the settlement of freed slaves of about 20 square miles of land on the Sierra Leone peninsular including the town of Freetown, which was ceded to the British Crown in the following year. Sierra Leone was proclaimed a British Colony from first of January 1808.
