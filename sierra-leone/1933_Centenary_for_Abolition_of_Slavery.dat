The stamps were printed by recess printing by Brandbury Wilkinson & Co. They were designed by Father F. Welch. The set of thirteen stamps depict various scenes. They were printed in sheets of 60, watermark script CA Typ IV and they were perforated 12. 

THE YEAR 1933 marked a double centenary: of the Statute for the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, and of the death of William Wilberforce who had done so much to promote that legislation.

It was appropriate that there should be a commemorative stamp issue and that this should be associated with the colony of Sierra Leone whose capital, Freetown, had received so many of the 'liberated Africans'. The site of Freetown had been selected in 1787 as a home for former natives of Africa and their descendants. From that time various groups were settled there, but it was after the passing of the Statute for the prohibition of the slave trade to British subjects and ships flying the British flag that the great influx of numbers took place after 1807. A court of Vice-Admiralty sat in Freetown to
try captains of slave ships and to control the release of the former slaves. Anyone who is interested in the fascinating story of events in the colony is referred to Dr Arthur Porter's Creoledom published by the Oxford University Press.

On 21 April 1933 the Crown Agents wrote to Messrs De La Rue calling for designs and quotations for a proposed stamp issue. They sent thirteen sketches which were to be returned within forty eight hours: offers with designs were to be submitted by 28 May. A letter in similar terms went to Messrs Bradbury Wilkinson. There were to be three values in single colours, a -Jd green, a l\half d red and a 3d blue,
and another ten values which would be either single or bi-coloured. The firms had to follow the sketches and the notes on their backs but 'the designer is allowed slight latitude to introduce his ideas providing the general layout etc of the sketches is maintained'. The stamp sizes were to be like those of the current Sierra Leone stamps (the so called Rice Fields), printed in sheets of sixty, gummed, perforated, numbered and interleaved with wax paper. Printing was to be by the direct plate or intaglio method.

Crown Agents would supply C A white watermarked postage paper of the size 17£ in x 15£ in at 17s 4d per ream of 500 sheets. All dies, plates and other material were to be under the control of Crown Agents' Chief Inspector. Proofs of the dies, and subsequently colour proofs in triplicate, were to be submitted before printing was commenced and, ultimately, the approved working designs were to be returned to Crown Agents suitably mounted for presentation to His Majesty The King.

A schedule of costs was attached to the Crown Agents' letter. For the dies and plates £42 10s would
be paid for the single colour, £55 for the bi-colour. For the 424 perforated Specimens that would be
required 4s per duty was allowed, and for the printing costs there was a range of prices from 1s 11-\half d per 1,000 stamps, if single colour and 1,221,000 printed, to 25s OJd per 1,000 stamps if bi-coloured and 7,680 printed. Those costs were to include the paper.

De La Rue submitted photographic essays on 25 May, a total of fourteen in all which included two of the 6d value 'to illustrate the bi-colour effect'. On the back of each essay was a colour wash of the colours recommended. They undertook to supply proofs of the first die in four weeks, to complete
the engraving in ten weeks, and to have the last printing plates ready four weeks after that. Their letter asked that, in the event of their being unsuccessful in securing the order, Crown Agents should ask the Government of Sierra Leone to reimburse their costs.

Bradbury Wilkinson also submitted designs by 26 May and on 13 June Crown Agents decided to
award the contract to them. Eleven designs were accepted; on the 5s value the eye of the elephant was to be repositioned and on the 6d value the letters G R were to be removed from the scrolls under the duty tablets. They were told to go ahead with engraving and to show black die proofs in triplicate.

Further alterations were made to the 5s value, this time to the herons and the tusks, and these were approved by 29 June. On that day the first black proof was accepted and permission given to start making the printing plates in two panes of sixty.

Over the next few weeks small modifications were made in the designs. The shading in the border of the 1d, the sky shading on the 5d, and the elephant's eye on the 5s were all altered. The black proofs, a set of colour proofs on unwatermarked paper, and the final colour proofs, were all finished in that order by 26 July. One final modification was made to the 4d when the printers were asked 'to move the nurse's left hand lower on the patient's pulse'. It is interesting to note the extreme care that was given to this issue and the fact that the engraving method could allow for these minor modifications.

Meanwhile Crown Agents had written to De La Rue to say that their submissions had been unsuccessful. Both companies had followed the artist's sketches closely but an examination of the Bradbury Wilkinson proofs and the De La Rue essays that accompany this article will show that the former's lettering and figures are generally larger and clearer. There was also far more shading in the De La Rue sky effects giving a heavier appearance. On 11 August Crown Agents wrote to say that the Sierra Leone
government would not accept a claim for expenses from the unsuccessful tenderer.

The sketches on which the finished designs were based were the work of Father F. Welsh and can repay close study for they are, in respect of the lower values, ingenious. In the De La Rue archives there was an annotated tracing of the original sketch for the \half d value. On one side is a seated native warrior welcoming the arrival of an old time sailing vessel. Alongside is a palm tree, suitable as the main export of the country was then palm kernels: above is a Union Flag shown without the arms of St Patrick as used before 1801, presumably indicating the founding of Freetown before that date.

Beneath the vignette is the dove of peace bearing an olive branch. This stamp would be used within the colony. On the Id, used on Commonwealth mail, was a liberated slave shown with broken fetters, freed on African soil. To each side is a cross of a pattern known as the cross of redemption. The 1\half d value, used on postcards to foreign countries, was a map of Africa and an enlargement of a part of West Africa. The frame lines are those of the latitude and longitude. The 2d value shows the law courts on the left and Fort Thornton, the Governor's residence, on the right. In the centre is the great cotton
tree, a site of a former slave market and a place under which slaves were set free. The century of progress was shown in the sides by old and new modes of transport.

On none of the values was there a portrait of Wilberforce, but that was a reflection of policy at that
time which limited stamp portraits to those of Sovereigns. However, on the 3d value the double centenary
was mentioned. Above this was a native woman bearing a basket of local produce and behind
her was a panorama of Freetown harbour. The 4d value is the most complex in its symbolism. In the centre are nurses attending a patient. One takes his pulse but we can see from the chart above the bed that the fever has abated. The portal through which the scene is viewed is historical, being that of the enclosure where the liberated slaves were sheltered, fed, and their sick attended. Later that was to be the site of a hospital. Above it is a cross for the early nursing Orders were Christian. In a letter to
Gibbons' Stamp Monthly Father Welsh commented 'The whole design is meant to be a monument to all those who like Wilberforce, Sharpe and so many others sacrificed themselves for the benefit of their African brothers. In particular I meant it as a tribute to the Medical and Sanitary Department . . .'.

The palm branches shown in the borders had a meaning deeper than of the local export for they were evocative of the palms shown on early Christian monuments.
