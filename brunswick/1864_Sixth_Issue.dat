# 1864 Rouletted Issue (Sixth Issue)

Up to 1864 none of the stamps had
been issued other than imperforate; but in July of that year the 1sgr was changed
in color, being printed in yellow on
white paper, and the opportunity was
taken of experimenting with a roulette.

In August 18G3, probably influenced by the use of rouletted stamps
by Bremen, experiments for the rouletting of stamps startedd for ,,-hich in Septembcr 1863
n. number of sheets of the lag blaek on yellow and thc 3sg rose were used. For these
trials two rouletting devices of br;:ISS lines were used, applying a roulette of short
dashes. One of these devices proyided a roulette 17, requiring two operations for
each sheet, first applying thc rouletting. 'n
one direction and tllen ill the otller. 

The other device, providing a roulette 12, rouletted
a sheet in a single operation, The
result of these trials was that Ute sheetsÂ· of
the new 1sg yellow, a.bout to be issued, were
roulett.ed ]2 with the second device .and were
issued ill July 1864. In the meantime, :lS

The rouletting was done in line and had a gauge of 12. Whether the cuts
were made by a rouletting wheel or on the printing press with ordinary notched
rule does not appear to be known. The roulette is always very indistinct owing to the thickness of the paper. It was not particularly satisfactory and in the following month other stamps appeared with the rouletted cuts arranged in a
series of short curves giving a scallop effect to the edges of severed stamps.
This is the style known as perces en arc
and it had a gauge of 16 1/2 to 17 1/2. This rouletting, Mr. Westoby tells us, was
done by the printer, Meyer, in the press by means of thin brass printer's rule.

The 1/3 ggr black on white,  1/2 sgr black
on green, 1sgr black on yellow, 1sgr
yellow on white, 2sgr black on blue, and
3sgr rose on white were all issued with
this roulette, some of them being extremely
rare. 

The 1/2 sgr black on green,
1sgr black on yellow, and 3sgr rose on
white are also known rouletted in line
but there seems considerable doubt as
to whether these varieties were issued
officially. The 1/2 sgr is also known perf. 12
but this is known to be an unofficial
production. 

To a note regarding this Mr. Westoby adds "nor is there any doubt that some rouletted specimens have been manufactured by the purveyors of varieties."
In the list below we only include those varieties regarding which there are no
doubts as to their official origin.


## Sheets

The sheets of all Brunswick stamps were issued to the post offices unseparated, but
originally the stamps were sold to the public only in horizontal strips of 10. This 
regulation, which was abolished only by decree of Oct. 14, 1859, is responsible for the rarity  of the early issues in verticall multiples.

It also seems that the sheet margins were cut off or removed of all issued sheets because
used copies with sheet margin are very rare and also come unused more frequently
only of those stamps of which remainders existed.
