# 1852 First Issue

While its neighbours. [Hanover](../hanover/Introduction) and
[Prussia](../prussia/Introduction), issued stamps in 1850, Brunswick
did not follow suit until January
1st, 1852, when a series of three values
was issued. All three values are of
similar design, the centerpiece showing
the horse of Brunswick galloping to the
left, with a ducal coronet above, the
whole being on a transverse oval with
ground of vertical lines. On each side
are small upright uncolored ovals containing
the numerals of value, and above
and below are scrolls the upper one
containing the name, "BRAUNSCHWEIG,"
and the lower one the
value, "EIN (ZWEI or DRIE) SILB.
GR." The whole is enclosed within
a double-lined rectangular frame, one
line being thick and the other thin.
The stamps were designed and engraved
by Herr K. Petersen, and
printed bv Herr J. H. Meyer, in Brunswick.

That separate dies were engraved
for each of the three values is
proved by slight differences in the designs,
especially noticeable in the number
and arrangement of the stones below
the horse. They were printed on
a fairly thick white wove paper and
the gum used was either reddish-brown
or white with a brownish tinge similar
to that used for the stamps of Hanover.
They were issued imperforate. According
to Mr. Ehrenbach (London Philatelist
vol. Ill, p. 162) the stamps were
printed in sheets of 120 arranged in
twelve horizontal rows of ten each, the
stamps being about 2 mm. apart. Mr.
Westoby states that the plates were composed
of type-metal casts, which may
account for the existence of the three
"types" of the Isgr differentiated by
Mr. Ehrenbach as follows :

Type I. With no dots on the figures
of value.

Type II. With a dot on the figure
at right.

Type III. With a dot on the figure at
'left.

Mr. Ehrenbach further states that
there is an error of lettering in type I
with the word "SILBG" reading "SIL.

" The stamps were only in use about
fourteen months and unused specimens,
with original gum, are among the rarest
of German stamps. Indeed, many authorities
consider the Isgr unused as
the rarest European stamp.
When the stamps were first placed
on sale considerable interest was evinced
in their issue by the public. It is said
that a huge crowd awaited the opening
of the chief post-office in the town of
Brunswick. At first only strips of ten
stamps were sold to purchasers but this
order was rescinded in 1853. Unfortunately
no official documents are
known to exist having any bearing on
the history of these stamps as one of
the Postmasters-General, who had a
terrible aversion to the accumulation
of papers and records, had ordered
everything to be burned.
