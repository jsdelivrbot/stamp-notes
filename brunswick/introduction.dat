# The Stamps and Postal History of Brunswick

Brunswick, or Braunschweig to give
it its Teutonic name, is a sovereign
duchy of the German Empire situated
between Hanover, Saxony, and Westphalia.
It has an area of 1424 square
miles and a population a little in excess
of half a million. The duchy has two
votes in the Imperial Council and sends
three representatives to the Imperial
Diet. Originally Brunswick formed a
part of the duchy of Saxony, but in
1235 the independent duchy of Brunswick
was created. Subsequently, along
with Hanover, Luneburg, Celle and
other territories, it was transferred and
reconveyed several times as the various
Brunswick dynasties were founded and
died out. The duchy suffered severely
during the Seven Years War. It was
occupied by the French in 1806, annexed
to the kingdom of Westphalia in
the following year, and restored to its
duke in 1813. The direct Guelf line
became extinct in 1884, on the death
of the childless Duke William, and since
1885 the duchy has been governed by
a regent.

The town of Brunswick, capital of
the duchy, is of ancient origin, its cathedral,
for instance, dating from 1172.

Here is found the tomb of Henry the
Lion, Duke of Saxony, whose descendants
created the independent duchy.

The currency was the same as that
of Hanover being the reichsthaler,
worth about 78c, divided into 24 gutegroschen
of 12 pfennige, or the thaler,
worth about 72c, divided into 30 silbergroschen
of 10 pfennige.

## Paper

The paper of the [first postage stamp issue](../brunswick/1852_First_Issue) of 1852 was machine-made, white to yellowish white, without watermark. From [1 March 1853](1853_Second_Issue), Brunswick
started to print its stamps on watermarked hand-made paper and at the same time to change from colored printingg on white paper
to black print on colored paper, a combination which at that time was favoured by all
its neighbour couutries and most other Old German States. 

The ehallge was induccd by
reports-the first olle as c:.trly as March 1852

## Gum


The gum used for the Brunswick stamps and envelopes was a vegetable glue, applied
with brushes by hand. On the postage stamps of 1852 it was rose to bright red and brownish rose. On the 1853 and later issues the gum was yellowish until about 1862, from then on colorless sometimes slightly brownish,
The envelopes had first "short" gum (20 to 30mm,) on the upper flap, from 1863
"long" gum (85 to 95mm,), a change started by Prussia. on its envelopes one year earlier,

## Building a Collection

Brunswick with two dozen stamps and some 50 post offices is an ideal country to specialize. The lack of english literature is certainly a serious
handicap, and it is responsible for the great ignorance of many collectors so far as information concerning Brunswick stamps and
stationery is concerned Brunswick would be an almost ideal field for a collector of
moderate means, if the roulettes coul not spoil the fun. But the collector can easily
disregard them at least the expensive trial roulettes and be well contented with the
balanlce of the stamps and stationery.
