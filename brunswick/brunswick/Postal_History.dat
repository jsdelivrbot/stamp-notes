The postal history of Brunswick has its
bCgitnlings in the courrier service which the
Hanseatic Leaguc had created in the middle
of the 14th century. 

During the 15th century,
the first mail routes bJ the Taxis
family started to operate in trausit through
Brunswick. Such mail service was first tolerated
but in 1569 Brunswick created its
own mail service, the "Landespost", and the
first postal law was published in 1586. 

When,
shortly later, the family of Taxis established
the "Reiehspost" and also started to
operate in 1616 directly on Brunswick territory-its
first postal agency was established
at the city of Brunswick in 1645-
this soon led to friction. 

During the 17th century, several mail services operated on
Brunswick territory. Aside from the "Landesposte" and the "Reichspost", Brandenburg
also Jw.d a post office at the capital Bruns·
wick and several mail lines operated by the
city aud primte venturcs had their ageucit:s
there. But the main competition developed
betwecn the "Landespost" [lild thc "Reichspost".

The "Reichspost" tried to have the "Landespost" suppressed. Several times the
abolition of the latter was ordered by the authorities of the German Empire, but the
Dukes of Brunswick resisted an such efforts successfully. 

In 1748, the quarrel came to a temporary end, the duke having given official
permission for the opening of a "Reichspost" office at the city of Brunswick.

But the old conflicts soon flared up again and the duke placed an possible difficulties
in the way of the "Reichspost". Eventually,
after Hanover had cancened an prerogatives
of the "Reichspost" in June 1790, Brunswick followed suit quickly. By ducal order,
the post offiec of the "Reichspost" was forcibly closed on July 1, 1790, and an mail
service taken over exclusively by the ''Landespost".

During the French occupation, which fonowed soon thercaftcr, the postnl
sen-icc was taken over by the kingdom I)f
Westphalia, but no major changes were
made and the "Landespost" was able to take
over again after the liberation in 1813 without
much difficulty. Close postal relations
existed with Hanover and by a special treaty,
for seven yrears, from 1835 to 1842, the Hanover postal administration also conducted
the postal service in the duchy of Brunswick.

On December 1, 1838, the first railroad,
from Braunschweig to Vlolfenbiittel,
was opened and from January 1, 1839, was
used for carrying the mails. 

On July 1, 1850, the railroad and postal service were
combined into one organization which henceforth was conducted by a "Herzoglich
Braunschweig-Luneburgische Eiseubalm\"und
Postdireetion". From 1835 to 1850, Hannover
maintained a postal agency on Brunnswick territory at Bodenburg, which was an
enclave in Hanover tcrritory. 

On January 1,1852, Brunswick became a member of the
German-Austrian Postal union. Its separate
postal service was dissolved on December
31, 

The number of post offices in Brunswick
was always relatively small. In 1830, there
were 30 post offices and their number increased only to 47 until the end of the prestnmp
period on December 31, 1851. 

During
the stamp period 10 post offices were opened
and 5 closed; therefore there were 52 post
offices in operation on December 31, 1867,
when the separate postal service of the
duchy of Brunswick came to a close. 

The main post office at the capital of Brunswick
was called ''Hof-Postamt'', of the others only
five were full post offices, while the balance
were postal agencies with somewhat reduced
service. 

Special \textit{city mail service}\index{city mail} existed at
Braunschweig and Wolfenb\"uttel from about
1845. A \textit{rural mail service} was introduced in
1853. 

No travelling post offices operated by
Brunswick existed on railroad trains, but
such post offiees operated by Prussia and
Hanover travelled through the country. 'The
mail service developed favourably during
the stamp period; there were 2,160,000
domestic letters in 1854 and about twice as
many, 4,276,000, in 1866.

### Post offices on foreign territory

Brunswick had several post offices on foreign territory, but only 
during the prestamp period. A post office at Goslar, on
lI:lllovcr territory, was closed in 1804, when
that city caIlle temporarily to Prussia. A
lIlidl sen'ice from Brunswick to Hamburg
was opened as a private enterprise in 1706,
which acquired the 113.me "Kitc.hen Mail"
because it also carried the food supplies for
the ducal household. It was taken over by
the "Landespost" in 1732, and the postill
agency at Hamburg bceame a "Fiirstlich
Br::wnschwcigisehes Postamt". In 1835, this
mail sen'ice was taken over by HallO,"'}r
nlld the Brunswick post offilile at Hnmburg
ceased to exist in 1836. A post office ~t
Oebisfelde, which existed on Prussian territory
just :lcross thc border and which
facilitated the transit of mail, was also
closed a few :rears later, on August 31, 1839.
Brunswick had the same currclIcy as Hano'·er,
namcly 1 thaler (th) of 24 gute gro·
schen (gg), olle gute groschen <livided illto
12 gute pfennig (gpf)_ For the lIlail service
to foreign countries, the currenc}" of the
other neighbors was in use, 1 thaler e<luivalCllt
to 30 silbergroschen (sg), one silbergroschen
divided into 12 sil!;lerpfelmig
(spf). Therefore, 10sg were equivalent to
8gg and 10spf to 8gpf. On January 1, 1858,
t.he domestic currency was put in line with
this silbcrgroschell currcncy, by introducing
a new cUl"l'ency, 1 Um]er e<luivalent to 30
grosellen (g), the groschen now being idcntic:d
with the silbergroschen, but still retaining
SOme individuality by making 1
groschen equivalent to 10 pfennig (pf). On
the S..lme day, this Hew currenc}" became the
b~lsis for domestic and foreign mail rates.
The unit of weight was the pound of 32
loth (one loth equivalent to about 76 ounce),
from 1858 the metric pound of 500 grams,
which was divided into 10 new loth, OIlO
loth being divided blto 10 quint (= 5
grams). For distmwesJ measurements were
lI13de in miles, equivalent to about i0 km.
The postal rates were rather simple. For
domestic letters, 6gpf (76gg) was eharged
for single letters (1 loth) in the TUral mail
service and up to 5 mi., 9gpf (~gg) for
more than 5 mi. to 10 mi., and 199 for more

th..Hl 10 mi. City letters paid 3gpf. 'fhe
registratioll f{'e was 199, the receipt fcc

was not collected for cit)" letters. When the
Ilew currency was introduced 011 January 1,

was HOW 12pf, the receipt fee 6pf and the
delh'cry fee 3pf. From Jan. 1, 1863, all domestic
letters paid Ig without regard to the
distanee, within the rural deliver)' zone 5pf.
City letters now were charged 3pf up to 15
loth. The registration fcc was Ig and the
receipt fre 5pt, while the deli\"cry fcc was
entirely abolished. From JallUarJ I, 1865,
a reduction of the rates for bulk city mail
took place. Single letters continued t.o pay
3pt, but for 10 letters only 2y;;g, more than
10 and up to 20 letters 5g, more thall 20 and
up to 50 letters iY;;g and more than 50 and
