# 1853 Second Issue on Watermarked, Coloured Paper

On March 1st, 1853, the stamps appeared printed in black on colored paper, the 1sgr being on yellow, the 2sgr on blue, and the 3sgr on rose. The stamps of the first issue were not called in or demonetised and this fact probably accounts for the scarcity of unused specimens.

\hr

The paper employed for the second
issue was hand-made, of coarse
texture, and was watermarked. The
watermark consisted of a posthorn,
turned to the left, within a rectangular
frame though occasionally, owing to the
paper being inserted wrong way into
the printing press, the device may be
found turned to the right. Every posthorn
of the 120 contained in a sheet
differs in size and shape from the others
the "bits" for the dandy-roll having
been made by hand. Mr. Meyer was
again entrusted with the printing of the
stamps, under the control of the administration,
and Mr. Westoby tells us
he used an ordinary printing press for
the purpose. The paper varies in shade as there were several printings
during the period the stamps were current.

The rose paper of the 3sg tended to fading, almost to white; stamps in distinct rose color are sought by connoisseurs. (\ref{darkrosepaper}).
