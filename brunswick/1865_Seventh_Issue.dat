# 1865 Seventh Issue

In October, 1865, stamps of a new design were introduced. The colors were
also changed so as to make them more in conformity with those adopted by
the Thurn and Taxis post-office and the German States. The dies, which were
engraved on steel at Berlin, were common to adhesives and a series of envelopes.

The design consists of the usual galloping horse surmounted by a ducal
crown, this being in white on an oval of solid color. Around this is an oval
band on which the name "BRAUNSCHWEIG" appears at the top and "GROSCHEN" at the base on an engine- turned ground. In the center of the band at each side of the horse is a
disc for the numerals of value. Four values were issued, 1/3gr, 1gr, 2gr and
3 gr all being embossed in color on plain white wove machine made paper. These are catalogued as Michel 17-20.

They were rouletted perces en arc like the set they superseded. The stamps were printed in sheets of 100 arranged in ten rows of ten.

Mr. Westoby gives an excellent account of the method employed in the
manufacture of these stamps and other embossed stamps of a similar nature issued
about the same time for Lubeck, Prussia, and Oldenburg:

\begin{blockquote}
The matrix dies were, with scarcely
any exception, engraved by Schilling,
the engraver to the Imperial Printing
Works. The central design alone was
first engraved on a block of steel in intaglio, from which a mechanical
workman made a punch in steel; and
if four values were required, he, with
the aid of the punch, sank the central
design on four steel dies, on which
the engraver subsequently added the
border and the proper inscriptions.
Were envelopes alone wanted, the process
was complete; but when adhesive
stamps were required a further process
was necessary, as plates had to be
constructed. The embossed adhesive
stamps were generally printed in
sheets of 100 or 150, arranged in
rows of ten. Fifty rectangular impressions
in lead of the size of the
stamp were struck from each die in a
fly-press, and these were clamped together
in a chase in five rows of ten.
\end{blockquote}

From each of these, two or three electrotypes were made, which formed the printing plate of 100 or 150 stamps. The vertical and horizontal rows were numbered consecutively in each margin in movable type figures, and the plate was ready for printing. The
process appears complicated, but it was not a very expensive one where the stamps were not required in large quantities.

Proofs of the new stamps were distributed
in January, 1865, and it was
stated they would be ready for issue
on April 1st, but, as we have already
stated, they did not actually appear until
October.

## Remainders

The remainders of the 1865 issue were sold in 1868. They were not offered in one lot but could be purchased by the 100 sheets at about 2 thalers by anyone interested. As a matter of fact most of them were purchased by one man, a German dealer, and that there must have
been a large stock of some values is obvious
from the low prices at which they are priced in catalogues.




The remainders included a large number of an ~mi.~S11,ed SlMnlJ, a
4/4gg in the same design ::IS the 4/4gg of 1857 and obviously printed from the same
settings, but yellow brown on white wnterJll::lrked
paper. It is claimed that these stamps were printed in error due to to a misunderstood printing order, but no officiall data concerning the actual history of this unissued stamp are known.
