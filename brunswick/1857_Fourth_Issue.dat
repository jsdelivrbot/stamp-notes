# 1857 Fourth Issue, The 4/4 ggr Postage Stamp


The 1/4ggr was only in use for eleven months (the total quantity printed being
271,040) when it was replaced by a new stamp of unusual design. This was a
large stamp, 24 mm. square, capable of being divided into four, each of the
divisions representing 3 pfennig, and the entire stamp being equivalent to 1
gutegroschen. The central portion of the stamp was divided into four squares
each containing a transverse oval inscribed "54" surmounted by a crown
with "Gutegr." below. Above the upper quarters and below the lower ones
is "Postmarke," and at the side of each square is "3 Pfennige" in italic
type. The whole is enclosed by a thick single-lined frame. This, it is interesting
to note, is the only Brunswick stamp failing to show the galloping horse. The stamps were printed in black on brown watermarked paper but as the paper was intended for stamps
of smaller size the posthorns appear very irregularly. The stamps were printed in sheets of 100 in ten rows of ten.

A large quantity of this value was printed in brown on white paper in 1866
but for some reason or other they were never issued. The variety is quite common,
however, for the entire lot was sold with the remainders in 1868, when
the post-office of Brunswick was absorbed by that of the North German
Confederation.
