# Postal History of Brunswick

The postal history of Brunswick has its beginnings in the courrier service which the
Hanseatic League had created in the middle of the 14th century. 

During the 15th century, the first mail routes by the Taxis family started to operate in transit through Brunswick. Such mail service was first tolerated
but in 1569 Brunswick created its own mail service, the "Landespost", and the
first postal law was published in 1586. 

When, shortly later, the family of Taxis established
the "Reichspost" and also started to operate in 1616 directly on Brunswick territory-its
first postal agency was established at the city of Brunswick in 1645-
this soon led to friction. 

During the 17th century, several mail services operated on
Brunswick territory. Aside from the "Landesposte" and the "Reichspost", Brandenburg
also had a post office at the capital Brunswick and several mail lines operated by the
city and private ventures had their agents there. But the main competition developed
betwecn the "Landespost" and the "Reichspost".

The "Reichspost" tried to have the "Landespost" suppressed. Several times the
abolition of the latter was ordered by the authorities of the German Empire, but the
Dukes of Brunswick resisted an such efforts successfuny. 

In 1748, the quarrel came to a temporary end, the duke having given official
permission for the opening of a "Reichspost" office at the city of Brunswick.

But the old conflicts soon flared up again and the duke placed an possible difficulties
in the way of the "Reichspost". Eventuany,
after Hanover had cancened an prerogatives
of the "Reichspost" in June 1790, Brunswick fonowed suit quickly. By ducal order,
the post offiec of the "Reichspost" was forcibly closed on July 1, 1790, and an mail
service taken over exclusively by the ''Landespost".

During the French occupation, which fonowed soon thercaftcr, the postnl
sen-icc was taken over by the kingdom I)f
Westphalia, but no major changes were
made and the "Landespost" was able to take
over again after the liberation in 1813 without
much difficulty. Close postal relations
existed with Hanover and by a special treaty,
for seven yrears, from 1835 to 1842, the Hanover postal administration also conducted
the postal service in the duchy of Brunswick.

On December 1, 1838, the first railroad,
from Braunschweig to Vlolfenbiittel,
was opened and from January 1, 1839, was
used for carrying the mails. 

On July 1, 1850, the railroad and postal service were
combined into one organization which henceforth was conducted by a "Herzoglich
Braunschweig-Luneburgische Eiseubalm\"und
Postdireetion". From 1835 to 1850, Hannover
maintained a postal agency on Brunnswick territory at Bodenburg, which was an
enclave in Hanover tcrritory. 

On January 1,1852, Brunswick became a member of the
German-Austrian Postal union. Its separate
postal service was dissolved on December
31, 

The number of post offices in Brunswick
was always relatively sman. In 1830, there
were 30 post offices and their number increased only to 47 until the end of the prestnmp
period on December 31, 1851. 

During
the stamp period 10 post offices were opened
and 5 closed; therefore there were 52 post
offices in operation on December 31, 1867,
when the separate postal service of the
duchy of Brunswick came to a close. 

The main post office at the capital of Brunswick
was caned ''Hof-Postamt'', of the others only
five were fun post offices, while the balance
were postal agencies with somewhat reduced
service. 

Special \textit{city mail service}\index{city mail} existed at
Braunschweig and Wolfenb\"uttel from about
1845. A \textit{rural mail service} was introduced in
1853. 

No travening post offices operated by
Brunswick existed on railroad trains, but
such post offiees operated by Prussia and
Hanover travened through the country. 'The
mail service developed favourably during
the stamp period; there were 2,160,000
domestic letters in 1854 and about twice as
many, 4,276,000, in 1866.

### Post offices on foreign territory

Brunswick had several post offices on foreign territory, but only 
during the prestamp period. A post office at Goslar, on
lI:nlovcr territory, was closed in 1804, when
that city caIne temporarily to Prussia. A
lIlidl sen'ice from Brunswick to Hamburg
was opened as a private enterprise in 1706,
which acquired the 113.me "Kitc.hen Mail"
because it also carried the food supplies for
the ducal household. It was taken over by
the "Landespost" in 1732, and the postin
agency at Hamburg bceame a "Fiirstlich
Br::wnschwcigisehes Postamt". In 1835, this
mail sen'ice was taken over by HanO,"'}r
nnd the Brunswick post offilile at Hnmburg
ceased to exist in 1836. A post office ~t
Oebisfelde, which existed on Prussian territory
just :lcross the border and which
facilitated the transit of mail, was also
closed a few :rears later, on August 31, 1839.
Brunswick had the same currclIcy as Hano'·er,
namcly 1 thaler (th) of 24 gute gro·
schen (gg), one gute groschen <livided into
12 gute pfennig (gpf)_ For the lIlail service
to foreign countries, the currenc}" of the
other neighbors was in use, 1 thaler e<luivalCnt
to 30 silbergroschen (sg), one silbergroschen
divided into 12 sil!;lerpfelmig
(spf). Therefore, 10sg were equivalent to
8gg and 10spf to 8gpf. On January 1, 1858,
t.he domestic currency was put in line with
this silbcrgroschen currcncy, by introducing
a new cUl"rsency, 1 Um]er e<luivalent to 30
grosenen (g), the groschen now being idcntic:d
with the silbergroschen, but stin retaining
SOme individuality by making 1
groschen equivalent to 10 pfennig (pf). On
the S..lme day, this Hew currenc}" became the
b~lsis for domestic and foreign mail rates.
The unit of weight was the pound of 32
loth (one loth equivalent to about 76 ounce),
from 1858 the metric pound of 500 grams,
which was divided into 10 new loth, OIlO
loth being divided blto 10 quint (= 5
grams). For distmwesJ measurements were
lI13de in miles, equivalent to about i0 km.
The postal rates were rather simple. For
domestic letters, 6gpf (76gg) was eharged
for single letters (1 loth) in the TUral mail
service and up to 5 mi., 9gpf (~gg) for
more than 5 mi. to 10 mi., and 199 for more
MERCURY STAMP JOURNAL
th..Hl 10 mi. City letters paid 3gpf. 'fhe
registration f{'e was 199, the receipt fcc
0gg, t.he deli\·ery fee 3gpf, but this fcc
was not conected for cit)" letters. When the
Ilew currency was introduced 011 January 1,
1858, the single letter rates became 3pf for
city mail, 6pf for rural letters :md letters
up to 5 mi., Opt from 5 up to 10 mi. nnd
12pf o,·cr 10 miles. The registration feo
was HOW 12pf, the receipt fee 6pf and the
delh'cry fee 3pf. From Jan. 1, 1863, an domestic
letters paid Ig without regard to the
distanee, within the rural deliver)' zone 5pf.
City letters now were charged 3pf up to 15
loth. The registration fcc was Ig and the
receipt fre 5pt, while the deli\"cry fcc was
entirely abolished. From JanUarJ I, 1865,
a reduction of the rates for bulk city mail
took place. Single letters continued t.o pay
3pt, but for 10 letters only 2y;;g, more than
10 and up to 20 letters 5g, more than 20 and
up to 50 letters iY;;g and more than 50 and
up to 100 letters 109 was c.harged in cash,
so that wh{'n 100 cit.r letters were
mailed the postage for C<'lch W:lS onl), Ipf.
Domestic mone.'" orders, whidl were introduced
on Junc 1, 1865, paid ]g up t.o 25th
:lnd 2g fOr over 25th to 50th. To the coun·
tries of the German-Austrian Postnl Union,
the letter rates for cach loth were 1sg up
to 10mL, 2sg over 10 to 20mi. and Ssg o\"(>r
20mL Printed matter paid }'Jsg for cneh
loth; the registration fee was Isg. From
January 1, 1858, the same amounts in grsOsehen
of the new currency werc charged.
Mail to other foreign countries paid rather
complicated rates, but frequently ]lostage
was paid to the border onl)", the postal administration
w}Jich took care of the mail in
tr:lilsit through their own post.al terrHors'y
aeeounting for the remaining fees with the
postal sen-ice of the country of destination.
Brunswick's first Postage Stamps werc i.:lsucd
on JnnuarJ 1, 1852, on which day the
heaty pro,"isionS of the German-Austrian
}>ostal Union became efrsecti"e in Brunswick.
E1I1;Clopes were issued on August 1, 1855,
Money Order Cards-for domestic sen'iee
onl...·-on June 1, 1865" Some kind of Postal
Stationery was eWn in usc Dlarry )-ears before
the first postage stamps were issued,
nnmely Receipts, wnieb were issued to the
sender for registered aml money letters ns
wen as pa.reels and later also for money
Orders. Such printed receipts which were
issued from as early as 1751, are first known with a stamp showing the receipt fee from
1836.

## Special Envelopes

By decree of Nov 24, 1844, special
Envelopes for City Mail at Brunswick City
were introduced. A special handstamp was
applied to letters sheets or envelopes presented by the public in quantities of twelve or
multiples thereof.

It is claimed that later
also envelopes with the same handstamps
were sold by the Brunswick post office, but
this seems rather doubtful. As the same
handstamp was also used as postmark to
mark all city letters posted at the Brunswick
post office against payment in cash the
character of these envelopes and letter sheets
as postal stationery is somewhat uncertain.
But they are certainly at least postal stationery
manufactured on private order.
There existed also Official Money Order
Cards for use by government offices, as well
as Official Receipts for official mail.


### Use of Stamps

The use of stamps was originally not obligatory
and postage and registration to the
countries of the German-Austrian Postal
Union could from Jan. 1, 1852, either be
paid in stamps or in cash. Unpaid letters
paid an dditional 1sg for each loth.
The use of stamps became obligatory (W
Aug. 11 1855, when the postmasters were
instructed to apply the nccessar;y stamps
themselves on all letters to countries of the
German-Austrian Postal Union, for which
postage was paid in cash at the post office.

Postage on domestic tnl(] other foreign mail
at first cOntinue(l to be pnid in cush, but the
usc of stamps for domestic mail was permitted
if they cMered the J'ates, for example
a Isg stamp for the ~gg domestic
rate. Only on :Marth II 1856, postage st.umps
were introduced for an fees on domestic
mail and their use became obligatory. Ou
the same day) also stamps for printed matter
to the countries of the German-Austrian
Postal Unionl fors which postage U1ltil then
was nsun lIy jJlJ id in cash-Itlthough use of
stnnlps, if the r:ltes could be coveredl was
.nlso permitted-were introduced. For other
foreign countries) the usc of stamps W38
first not permitted, but later graduany introduced
to nil destinations; it nc\"cr be-
.came obligntory. 'rhe <leli\"ery fee, Wnich
~'·3.s usuany Jnnrked on the letters in peu,
eould be einiers paid by the nddressee in
eash 01'1 from Mnrsch 1, 1856, 11Y the sender
hl stnmps. OdginaJly, st:nnPS nnd stationery
were 110t sold singly, but oiny in stdps
or batches of 10. This rather unusual regu-
lation was abolished only after more than
7 3/4 years, by decree of Oct. 14, 1859.
