In 1871, Qatar joined the Turkish suzerainty at AL Ahsa area and the Turkish castle was
built in Doha.
		
In 1916, during the rule of sheikh Abdullah Bin Jassem Al Thani, a protection treaty with
England was signed by Qatar along with Bahrain and Oman Trucial emirates.
		
During the start of the Qatar oil company (at the end of the Second World War), mail was sent via Bahrain due to its close location and existing post office. These letters were cancelled with a Bahrain stamp and only identified as coming from Qatar from the sender’s return address.
		
Prior to 1st April 1948, stamps from India with Bahrain overprint were used. After this date, British stamps with Bahrain overprint were used.
		
With the rapid growth of the oil industry, it was necessary to establish the British post ٌRepresentative’s office in Doha. Mail origination in Qatar was hand carried in a diplomatic bag to Bahrain.
		
As part of the British protection agreement in may 1950, the first Postal Office in Qatar was established to handle the increasing number of letters being sent by oil workers out of Qatar.
		
The political officer cancellation stamp was used since no Doha postmark was available at the time.
