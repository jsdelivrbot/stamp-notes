The postal history of {{wi:Monaco}} can be traced to the principality's 
first postmark in 1704. Stampless covers are known having been marked either
with manuscript marks oe with
handstamp postmarks for Monaco and Fort d'Hercule (1793-1814 French occupation); 
as the principality was once much larger, postmarks of the communes 
of Menton and Roquebrune prior to their 1848 secession might also be 
included. Monaco used Sardinian stamps from 1851 until 1860, when by 
the {{wi:Treaty_of_Turin}}, Sardinia ceded to France the surrounding county 
of Nice and relinquished its protectorate over Monaco; French stamps 
with Monaco or Monte-Carlo postmarks were used thereafter. 
Two forms of cancellation are known for the French period. 

With the first, the postmark is on the cover away from the stamps; 
an obliterator with an identifying post office number 4222, or later 2387, 
inside a diamond of ink dots cancelled the actual stamps. The second applied 
the postmark directly on the stamps, as both a date stamp and cancel. All of 
these postal forerunners, particularly usages of Sardinian stamps 
with Monaco cancels, are far more valuable than the same stamps 
postally used in the issuing countries.[1]

The first Monegasque postage stamps were issued on July 1, 1885 and featured 
the image of Prince Charles III of Monaco.[2]

In 1937, the principality responded to a growing interest from philatelists 
by creating a Stamp Issuing Office.[2] The 1949 accession of Prince Rainier III 
led to increased importance for the principality's philatelic issues. 
During his reign, the prince was personally involved in all aspects of 
the design and format of the principality's philatelic issues, and he 
was quoted as stating that stamps were "the best ambassador of a country."[3] 
The prince was a noted philatelist and his collection was the basis of 
Monaco's Museum of Stamps and Coins.[4]

The seabirds series issued over the years are beautiful stamps and are
well sought after by thematics collectors.

Monaco joined the Universal Postal Union in 1955 and PostEurop in 1993[2]. 
Monaco's postage stamps, which are tied to French postal rate, 
continue to be popular among collectors and are considered to be a 
source of revenue for the principality.[5][6]
