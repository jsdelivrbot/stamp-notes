The postal history of {{wi:Monaco}} can be traced to the principality's 
first postmark in 1704. Stampless covers are known having been marked either
with manuscript marks oe with
handstamp postmarks for Monaco and Fort d'Hercule (1793-1814 French occupation); 
as the principality was once much larger, postmarks of the communes 
of Menton and Roquebrune prior to their 1848 secession might also be 
included. Monaco used Sardinian stamps from 1851 until 1860, when by 
the {{wi:Treaty_of_Turin}}, Sardinia ceded to France the surrounding 
county of Nice and relinquished its protectorate over Monaco; French stamps with Monaco or Monte-Carlo postmarks were used thereafter. Two forms of cancellation are known for the French period. 

With the first, the postmark is on the cover away from the stamps; 
an obliterator with an identifying post office number 4222, or later 2387, 
inside a diamond of ink dots cancelled the actual stamps. The second applied 
the postmark directly on the stamps, as both a date stamp and cancel. All of 
these postal forerunners, particularly usages of Sardinian stamps 
with Monaco cancels, are far more valuable than the same stamps 
postally used in the issuing countries.[1]

The first Monegasque postage stamps were issued on July 1, 1885 and featured 
the image of Prince Charles III of Monaco.[2]

The first means of communication between Monaco and its neighbours was via the Aurelian Way from
Rome to the Alpes Maritimes. Monte Carlo was named after Charles III, great-grandfather of Prince Rainier.
Along the mountainous route, mail was transported on foot. Most of the early correspondence was transit
mail. In striking contrast was a letter written by Louis XIV, King of France, on 30 December 1694 to his
'cousin', the Duke of Valentinois. 'Cousin' was a form of address between reigning nobility at the time. The
eldest son of the Prince of Monaco carries the title Duke of Valentinois corresponding to the title Prince of
Wales in Great Britain. Valentinois is one of the four estates which the Grimaldis own in France. In the letter
the King of France complains that not enough military help has been forthcoming from Monaco during the
last French campaign!

Postage had to be paid by the recipient. It was charged according to the distance travelled and the letter's
weight in ounces. Until 1792 the rate was charged in sols. During the French revolution, when Monaco was
annexed, sols and livres were changed into sous and livres, in 1796 into decimes and francs, and only from
1849 was the charge in centimes and francs. An ordinary letter (usually one sheet) from Monaco to Marseille
cost 4 sols in 1736. The rate to Agde in France, being further away, was higher. To economise, people wrote
in both directions - criss-cross.

Prior to the nineteenth century it was common practice in most French post offices, as well as in certain
other foreign countries, to indicate the name of the post office of origin in the upper left-hand corner of the
letter.

In 1789 the French Revolution broke out. The Constituent Assembly transformed the 34 provinces of
France into 83 departments. Monaco was occupied by French troops, annexed and postally incorporated into
the department of the 'Var' in the same year. 'Var' was given number '78', the postmark usually faint and in
red. The numbered departments may be seen as the forerunner of the zip code numbers of today (Figure 1).


Like many arrangements during the Revolution, the use of '78' was short lived. In September 1794,
Monaco was transferred to the department of'Alpes Maritimes' with the number '85'.
I must add a few words regarding the dates seen on covers of this period. In order to strike a blow against the
Church, and to break the connection of the calendar with Christian associations, Pierre Sylvain Marechal
(1750-1803) introduced in the Almanach des Honnestes Gents in 1788 a new Calendar for France. He
divided the year into 12 months of 30 days each with 5 (in a leap year 6) 'supplementary days' at the end of the
last month. Each month was divided into 3 periods of 10 days (decades) each. The calendar became law on
5 October 1793, but was started retrospectively from the day of the Proclamation of the Republic,
22 September 1792, the day of the autumnal equinox. The poet Fabre d'Eglantine named the months more or less in accordance with the seasons. The first month (22 September-21 October) is Vendemiaire - the vintage
month. Floreal - the flower month - is the eighth month of this calendar, its first day corresponding to
20 April.
Between 1793 and 1794 a considerable number of French towns were renamed. Monaco was called 'Fort Hercule' (Figure 2). The new-fangled name caused confusion and loss of mail.

P.85.P. above the word Monaco stands for Port Paye (postage paid) in contrast to '85' alone. The 'P.P.'
flanking the '85' shows that the sender has already paid for the postage (Figure 1). According to postal regulations,
a boxed 'PP' had to be stamped on the letters as well, this showing the recipient that the postage had
been paid in full. Unpaid letters could be posted in a letter-box, but prepaid letters had to be handed over to a
postal employee. Prepayment was usually adopted if the letter was of more than ordinary importance, when
the addressee was unlikely to accept the letter, or when the recipient was of such exalted position that he
could not be expected to pay for his mail.

With the collapse of France, Monaco was punished for having sided with Napoleon, although she never really had a choice. It was laid down in the Treaty of Paris that Sardinia would in future control department 85. In 1794 Menton was incorporated into department 85. Therefore, Menton cancellations from that date (until 1861, when Menton reverted to France) can be considered as belonging to a Monaco collection (Figure 3).

Not all handstamps are always correctly applied. One letter showed a cachet Consul de France, Republique Francois. The letter is dated 2 December 1852. This is one day too late, as the Republic ceased to exist on 1 December 1852.

After 1838, a new entry mark was used on mail into France, replacing the boxed ITALIE/PAR/ANTIBES. The new cachet is a red double circle with the words SARD.-ANTIBES or SARDAIGNE-ANTIBES between the lines, the date in the middle in three lines giving day, month and year. All 13 different cachets that were used, were shown.

The cachet CS1R stands for Correspondence Sarde Premier Rayon. This was a guide for postal clerks to levy rates according to the distance the letter travelled, in this case out into the first rayon or zone. A letter marked CS3R means that the distance travelled was into the third zone.

A '3' is affixed on some letters in Antibes. It indicates the amount due to the Sardinian post office in accordance with the Franco-Sardinian Convention of 28 June 1817. If the rate is, for instance, 7 decimes, then 3 decimes are due to Sardinia and 4 to the postal administration of France. All mail addressed to France went via {{wi:Antibes}}.

Sardinian stamps were used for a period of only 5 years in Monaco and Menton.
After the treaty of Turin (June 1860), French stamps of all values were on regular sale at the post offices of
the Comte de Nice, as the department was called at the end of the Sardinian period. Sardinian cancellations
were still valid for 3 months thereafter.

\subsection{Lozenge Cancellers}

The first numeral Monaco was given after it reverted back to French stamps was the 'small figures' 4222 in
a dotted lozenge. This number was changed soon into a small 2387, also in a dotted lozenge. As small
numbers were not easily readable, they were soon changed to a larger type, first with fine later on with bold
numerals (Figure 4).

Registered letters were charged at twice normal rate. Registration worked like this: the sender obtained a receipt but he had to sign a document that he would not claim from the postal authorities in case of loss. No
responsibility was accepted; registration was just some sort of security.

During the Siege of Paris by the Prussians in 1870-71, mail was flown out of Paris by Ballon monte
(Figure 5); it was also submerged in the Seine by the service organised from Moulins-sur-Allier in an attempt
to reach the beleaguered city (Figure 6).

In 1885 came the first Monagasque stamps bearing the head of Charles III. As Monaco has hardly any trade
and derives its income from the casino, stamps make a welcome addition to the budget through the sales to
the visitors.

Let me give a last word on the reigning monarch: Prince Rainier is the son of Princess Charlotte of Monaco.
She was a Grimaldi who married Prince Pierre, Comte de Polignac. Rainier III is their son, and he became a
Grimaldi by Sovereign ordinance of 18 March 1920. His father, whose name he discarded, lived until 1949

\section{The stamps of Monaco}

The first Monegasque stamps, which show a portrait of Charles III (1818-89), were issued in 1885, forty-five
years after those of Great Britain, and are today called a 'modern classic'.
Multiples and panes are known of most values except for the 5fr. The one shown by Prince Rainier at international
exhibitions is not of the normal perforated issue. It was specially printed from the original dies with
the perforation holes painted in with very fine dots. For a stamp exhibition in Monte Carlo in 1900 the whole
series was re-issued on Bristol paper, otherwise identical to the first printing. Finished and unfinished proofs
were shown on art paper, on thin paper and on cardboard as well as a frame of forgeries (Figures 7/8).
Many forgers took to this issue, even forging the comparatively low value of 40 centimes. Engravers from
Turin. Piemont, Geneva and France tried their hand. It is believed that the more valuable 5fr was even more frequently imitated. Some others came from Belgium and still others from sources unknown.

All values of the normal issue were shown on cover including the 5fr. Although that cover was obviously
franked far in excess of the postal rate it did go through the mail and thus may be preferable to a copy
cancelled to order.
A new definitive set with the portrait of Albert I was issued in 1890. Initially, printing was exactly the same
as in the first issue, ie sheets of 150 stamps divided into 6 post office panes of 25 each. However, from 1892
two new features appear: Post office panes are horizontally divided by a coloured band in the gutter. More
important is the addition of a numeral in the vertical gutter dividing the panes. There are 3 numerals called
millesimes on each printing sheet, one each between horizontal pairs of panes. The millesime indicates the
last digit of the year of printing. While this makes it easy for the collector, there are problems with values
having a very long run. This issue was printed again and again, the last time in 1924. A millesime '3' might
have been printed in 1893, in 1903, in 1913 or 1923. Some paper differences are noticeable specially during
and after World War 1 when inferior paper was used. To the best of my knowledge only the collection of
Prince Rainier in the Palace at Monte Carlo has a full set of panes of each printing as it was issued. Millesimes
on genuinely used letters are hard to find as at the time no attention was paid to the numerals in the inter-pane
gutter. Generally speaking, gutter markings have attracted the attention of collectors only during the last 40
years or so.
As mentioned before, issues after 1918 were printed on inferior paper. The 1920 issue celebrating the
marriage of Princess Charlotte is an example; the paper is marked 'G.C.' (Grande Consommation) with the
millesime '9' having been printed in 1919. The 5fr value of this set, fortunately not forged as frequently as that
of 1885, is shown in mint, used and a millesime pair. It is amusing that the wedding stamp is dated 20 March
1920 and the next issue, in honour of the birth of Princess Antoinette, bears the overprint of 28 December
1920 almost exactly nine months later (Figure 9).
The setting for the overprint of the former issue shows an inverted V. A very observant collector spotted
that error on the day of issue. He promptly franked a card with the 3 values showing the inverted V in the
centre. As post offices were open during the season for the convenience of visitors until 9 pm he managed to
register and post this card on the day of issue. I have not seen nor heard of a similar item, not even in the collection of Prince Rainier.

Most Monegasque stamps were printed by the French Government Printer in Paris, except for the Prince
Louis II issue of 1922 and the Views of Monaco issued in July 1923 which were typographed and printed by
Messrs Enschede of Holland.

The use of remainders by having them overprinted for values in great use appeals to me as a frugal housewife.
At the same time variations in these overprints afford plenty of opportunity for study of these issues.
The exhibit continued with finished and unfinished die proofs and epreuves de luxe, and Postage Dues of
the period 1905 to 1910, both mint and on cover.

Finally there are the airmail items, beginning with the [Air Rally of 1914](../monaco/1914_Air_Rally) which ended in Monte Carlo.

Competitors had to start from any of eight European cities. Only three planes made it all the way, another three managed only part of the way and two from Rome and Vienna did not fly at all. But at the starting points cards were issued to commemorate the event. Those who completed the flight show a 5 cent stamp on the reverse cancelled on the day of arrival 3.4.14. Monaco being one of the treaty states contributed to mail flown by the Zeppelin. Some covers of flights during 1932 and 1933 completed the write-up.

In 1937, the principality responded to a growing interest from philatelists 
by creating a Stamp Issuing Office.[2] The 1949 accession of Prince Rainier III 
led to increased importance for the principality's philatelic issues. 
During his reign, the prince was personally involved in all aspects of 
the design and format of the principality's philatelic issues, and he 
was quoted as stating that stamps were "the best ambassador of a country."[3] 
The prince was a noted philatelist and his collection was the basis of 
Monaco's Museum of Stamps and Coins.[4]

The seabirds series issued over the years are beautiful stamps and are
well sought after by thematics collectors.

Monaco joined the Universal Postal Union in 1955 and PostEurop in 1993[2]. 
Monaco's postage stamps, which are tied to French postal rate, 
continue to be popular among collectors and are considered to be a 
source of revenue for the principality.[5][6]
