\chapter{1914 Air Rally}

Finally there are the airmail items, beginning with the Air Rally of 1914 which ended in Monte Carlo. Competitors had to start from any of eight European cities. Only three planes made it all the way, another three managed only part of the way and two from Rome and Vienna did not fly at all. But at the starting points cards were issued to commemorate the event. Those who completed the flight show a 5 cent stamp on the reverse cancelled on the day of arrival 3.4.14.
