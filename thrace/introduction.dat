Greek Army enters Edirne, Eastern Thrace on 12 July, 1920
GREEK ARMY ENTERS EDIRNE ON 12 JULY, 1920
Thrace, the region which encompasses European Turkey, southern Bulgaria and eastern Greece, had been under Ottoman rule since the 14th century. Northern Thrace became the province of [Eastern Rumelia](../eastern-rumelia/Introduction) in 1878, and was annexed by the [Kingdom of Bulgaria](../bulgaria/Introduction) in 1885. As a result of the Balkan wars (1912-13), Western Thrace ended in the hands of the Kingdom of Bulgaria, and Eastern Thrace continued to be part of the Ottoman Empire.

Toward the end of World War 1, in 1918, Entente forces defeated Bulgaria in Macedonia and as part of the surrender agreement, Bulgaria was forced to retreat from the area of Western Thrace, while “inter-allied” forces assumed control. On 10 Oct, 1919, General Charpy of France went to and assumed military control over the area. On 22 Oct, 1919, General Charpy was appointed Governor of Western Thrace, with headquarters in Komotini (Gumulcine). The subsequent Treaty of Neuilly agreed in November, Bulgaria ceded all of Western Thrace to the Entente, thereby cutting off Bulgaria’s direct outlet to the Aegean Sea.

After the war, the Allied Supreme Council (without the U.S.), gathered at a conference in San Remo in April, 1920. At that conference, it was agreed (among other things) that the Greeks would assume control of Western Thrace, and would be allowed a Greek presence in eastern Thrace as well as on the Anatolian west coast and the Aegean Islands commanding the Dardanelles. Upon this agreement Greek forces moved into Western Thrace to replace the international troops, and on 20 May, 1920, Greece officially annexed Western Thrace. This was quickly followed by the Treaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920) which essentially carved up the Ottoman Empire and the Anatolian region was never really accepted by all parties, but essentially gave Greece Eastern Thrace as well.

During this period, two major but related conflicts occurred. The Greco Turkish War (1919-1922) where Greece attempted to take as much land as possible including, Eastern Thrace, Eastern Anatolia and most of the islands in the Aegean. Simultaneously, the War of Turkish Independence (1919-1923) led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk consolidated a Turkish nationalist movement and built a provisional army which eventually forced out occupational forces from Anatolia, overthrew the Ottoman Sultanate and established a modern secular state.

In Thrace, shortly after the annexation of Western Thrace, Greece moved quickly into Eastern Thrace. On 12 July, 1920, Greeks established their headquarters in Adrianople where the following day King Alexander I arrived in the city in a show of “victory”. After taking all of Thrace, they began their efforts in advancing into Ionia. With little support from its allies, Greece overextended its armies, and Turkey, with Soviet support, turned the tide of the war with a major with offensive launched on August 26, defeating the Greeks at the Battle of Dumlupınar near Afyon. Even today, 30 Aug, 1922, celebrated as the Victory Day and a national holiday in Turkey. Over the next couple of months, without support from Britain, France or Italy, Greece retreated from Anatolia and Eastern Thrace.

The war ended in late 1922, and a settlement at the Greco-Turkish Convention (20 Jan, 1923) allowed for the mutual exchange of populations where all Greeks resident in Turkey – except those in Constantinople and Eastern Thrace – were to be deported to Greece and, conversely, all Moslems in Greece – except those in Western Thrace – were to be deported to Turkey. Final borders were agreed at the Lausanne Treaty signed on 24 Jul, 1923.
