\chapter{Introduction}


This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Penrhyn.
Penrhyn also known as Tongareva is the most remote and largest atoll of the 15 Cook Islands in the south Pacific Ocean.It has a population of 213 and is
3.8 sq. mls/9.8 sq. kms. So it is a very tiny island with the danger of being submerged if global sea levels keep rising. Islanders live in two main villages...Omoka (left) is considered the main island as it's where the government, shipping and air service offices are located.   Three quarters of all the islanders live there.  Tetautua is about 10.5 kms (6 miles) away across the lagoon and has around 50 residents. Robert Broussard was one of the first outsiders to visit Omaka after Penrhyn was designated as an official port of entry to the Islands and he has kindly provided the picture.

However, the most commonly-used name is Penrhyn after the "Lady Penrhyn" commanded by Captain William Cropton Lever who landed on August 8 1788. Another European name was Bennett Island.

Lamont

The missionaries arrived in 1854. Tongareva, together with many other Pacific islands, suffered the ravages of Peruvian slave raiders in the 19th century. In 1863 some 410 of the total population of about 500 were removed by trickery, the Spanish Peruvian perpetrators being abetted by four native missionary teachers who sold these unfortunates for five dollars a head! In fact, three of them accompanied the slaves to Peru as interpreters. The Peruvians knew the island as the Island of the Four Evangelists. The shipwrecked Lamont was one of the keenest observers of Pacific island life in the 19th century. He wrote in detail of his year on Tongareva in his classic "Wild Life Among the Pacific Islanders".

After voyaging to Tahiti and the southern Cook Islands where he made numerous acerbic observations about the activities of the missionaries, his ship headed north and, after being caught in a storm, was wrecked on the reef. He and a handful of survivors were captured by the islanders and became embroiled in their internal wars. Lamont obtained three wives during the course of his year on the atoll before being rescued.
  
Accommodation is available at Tarakore. There are regular flights via Air Rarotonga to Tongareva each Saturday from Rarotonga with a brief stop at Aitutaki. Flight time is four hours.

\section{Modern Stamps}

Modern stamps are colourful and clearly printed for the philatelic market. The Island has issued almost 760 stamps since the start of the postal service, the majority of which have been in recent years.
