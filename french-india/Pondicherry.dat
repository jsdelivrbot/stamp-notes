\section{Stamps of the 1849 and presidency Issues use in French Colonies}

The French Government decided in June 1851 to send stamps to  certain of her
Colonies. The 25c. President was sent only to French Guiana and the 10c., 25c., 
and 1 franc of 1849 were sent in the following quantities.\cite{LP0857}

The rates were:

a) By French commercial steamship 35c.

b) By British packet-boat 1.50
per 7.5gr.

Notwithstanding the high charges of the British liners, nearly everybody preferred this
method of transport because of the extreme slowness of the French commercial ships.
This is the reason why covers with 35c. franking are extremely rare---less than ten covers
are known today.

As the merchants in the French Indie also preferred the British post, nearly all the stamps
were sent to the Isle of Reunion. The exact number of stamps sent to French Guiana is not known, but it was certainly very small and only a few covers are known.

The stamps used in the Colonies were not cancelled on departure, but only on their arrival
in France. Only the dated circular stamp on the cover enables us to identify the Colonial
origins. Covers of the French Indies with stamps of the first issue are unknown.
