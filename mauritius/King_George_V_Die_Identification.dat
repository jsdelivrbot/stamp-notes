Hi All

This quick tutorial is to assist those that maybe are not aware of the differences in the design of the keyplate used by many countries that issued definative stamps using this design.

Plate consists of two types with very easliy identified characteristics. Many items can be worth a lot of money if correctly identified.


DIE 1

1) there is a spur on the floral design at the bottom of the stamp

2) the second line below the country follows the shape of the crown

3) the corner of the bar next to the head of George V is rectangular
