S.G. #8/15, 1849-57 2p Blue, plate reconstruction cplt., made up of five stamps from the early and late early impressions and the rest being intermediate impressions from early to normal intermediate, this reconstruction has a most interesting and illustrious past, the original plating came from Ferrary collection in 1921 purchased by Burrus, Burrus upgraded and changed five positions (2, 6, 9, 10 and 11) of which positions 10 and 11 came from the Hind reconstruction sold in 1934, the object of all these famous collectors was to reconstruct an attractive reconstruction of the twelve positions, nearly all of these have four clear margins with the exception of positions 5 and 8 which encroach slightly at points, some have huge margins with extremely fine appearance, though there are some small back flaws and a couple stamps have repairs, the real treasure in this plating is position 7, which shows the "Penoe" variety, this stamp is a late print of the early impression that shows indistinct vertical lines, it is exceptionally fresh and sound with full even margins all around, color is bright and pretty with a light numeral "2" cancel, truly a select example of this scarce and popular variety, the others in the reconstruction compliment this key stamp, some even equal it in condition; a rare unit that would be difficult to duplicate; 1987 Holcombe certificate for the reconstruction and an additional seven certificates for individual values issued at the same time; ex-Ferrary, Hind and Burrus (Scott #6, 6a; $46,000.00).
