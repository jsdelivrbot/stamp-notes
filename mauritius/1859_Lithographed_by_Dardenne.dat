\chapter{1859 Lithographed by L.A. Dardenne} 

In 1859, Mauritius released a third design, a two pence stamp very crudely engraved by Jules Lapirot, and known as the “Lapirot” issue.  The stamp was described as “the greatest libel upon Her late Majesty Queen Victoria that has been ever been perpetrated” and it was nicknamed in France as the tête de singe (monkey head) issue.

The final local product was a one penny red and two pence blue lithographed by L. A. Dardenne in 1859
