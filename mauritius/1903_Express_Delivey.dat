The stamps were engraved by Joseph Osmond Barnard, born in England on August 10, 
1816, who stowed away on a ship to Mauritius in 1838. [5]. 
The designs were based on the then current issue of Great Britain stamps (first released in 1841), 
bearing the profile head of Queen Victoria and issued in two denominations in similar colors: one penny red brown and two pence blue[6]. Although these locally-produced stamps have a distinct primitive character, they made Barnard’s “name immortal in the postal history of Mauritius” [7].

The words "Post Office" in the left panel were replaced in the following issue by "Post Paid." A legend arose later that the words "Post Office" had been an error. [8] The "Post Office" stamps and this legend are discussed in greater detail in the Mauritius "Post Office" article.
