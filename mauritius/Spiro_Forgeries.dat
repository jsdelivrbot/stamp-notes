1847-59 QV 2d sheet of 32 in blue, each row being the 2d Post Office, 2d Post Paid early or worn impressions & 2d Lapirot, 
with each half of sheet the same, but with all different impressions in each half. 
Basically the 8 stamps in each of the 2nd row \& the 4th row are very similar, but in 1st \& 3rd rows stamps show 2 distinct types on each row with totally different shading of Queens face (ie: 4 stamps of lined shading over much of face vs 4 stamps dotted shading over only small part of face).
all early forgeries (believed made in 1880s-1890s probably by Spiro) 
VF UN as made. 
SG would cat \pound10,000,000+ if genuine!

In 2013 a set of them was sold at an atrocious price in the US. Certainly overvalued, as I remember buying them (amongst other similar items) for less than \pounds200 and thinking that I overpaid for them (just wanted the Cape of Good Hope one).
