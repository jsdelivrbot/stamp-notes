## Mauritius

The region known as and referred to as "Indian Ocean Territories" included
Mauritius, [Seychelles](../seychelles/introduction), [Reunion](../reunion/introduction), the Comoro Archipelago and [Madagascar](../madagascar/introduction). The
most dominant mail route for most of the 19th Century were the French Packets
from Marseille, which became later known as \textsc{Ligne T}. However several other
routes were also offered.

\subsection{The Victorian period}

In 1847, Mauritius followed Great Britain in issuing stamps carrying the 
image of the current regent of Great Britain, Victoria, which practice would be followed throughout the British Empire. Most of the early issues of Mauritius were locally designed and produced and have a distinct 'primitive' character.

##The "Post Office" stamps
"Post Office" 1847

On September 21, 1847, Mauritius issued two stamps, an orange-red one penny (1d) 
and a deep blue two pence (2d) [3]. 
The words "Post Office" appear in the left panel, but were changed 
to "Post Paid" in the following issue, and are the source of the stamps' common name. 
The "Post Office" stamps are among the rarest stamps in the world, 
and are of legendary status in the world of philately.

Five hundred of each were printed from a single plate bearing both 
values, many of which were used on invitations sent out by the Mauritian Governor's wife for a ball which she was holding that weekend. [4]

The stamps were engraved by Joseph Osmond Barnard, born in England on August 10, 
1816, who stowed away on a ship to Mauritius in 1838. [5]. 

The designs were based on the then current issue of Great Britain stamps (first released in 1841), 
bearing the profile head of Queen Victoria and issued in two denominations in similar colors: one penny red brown and two pence blue[6]. Although these locally-produced stamps have a distinct primitive character, they made Barnard's name immortal in the postal history of Mauritius [7].

The words "Post Office" in the left panel were replaced in the following issue by "Post Paid." A legend arose later that the words "Post Office" had been an error. [8] The "Post Office" stamps and this legend are discussed in greater detail in the Mauritius "Post Office" article.

Sherwin issue 1859

Following the 'Post Office' stamps, Mauritius released several stamps also bearing Queen Victoria's profile, locally designed, and primitive in appearance.

In 1848, Mauritius issued the first denomination (two pence) of the "Post Paid" issue, one and two pence stamps closely similar to the "Post Office" issue also engraved by Barnard. The one penny orange was issued in 1854. [9]

In 1859, Mauritius released a third design, a two pence stamp very crudely engraved by Jules Lapirot, and known as the "Lapirot" issue. [10]

In 1859, the two pence blue was re-engraved by Robert Sherwin. [11] The final local product was a one penny red and two pence blue lithographed by L. A. Dardenne in 1859. [12]

The 'Post Paid' through the Sherwin issues were printed in sheets of 12 and stamp collectors have 'plated' or reconstructed full sheets from individual or pairs of stamps, relying on small variations in the individual plates. [13] The sheet size of the Dardenne issue is unknown. [14]
