\section{French Offices in Zanzibar, Stamps and Postal History}

The French post offices in Zanzibar were post offices operated by France in [Zanzibar](../zanzibar/Introduction) from 1894 to 1904, when the United Kingdom took direct control of what had previously been a protectorate. The French post office was opened in January 1889. From 1895 onwards the British demanded its closure, but it remained open until mid 1904. Early issues were French stamps overprinted in the local currency.

In 1902 French stamps of the 1900 series were issued with "Zanzibar" as a part of the design, but still overprinted in local currency. Many of the stamps, especially those of 1897 created by printing on stamp margins, are very rare and expensive.
