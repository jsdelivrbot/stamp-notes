# Introduction to the Stamps and Postal History of Oldenburg

Prior to the North German Confederation, German States stamps were issued by most of the separate Germanic kingdoms, duchies, free-cities, etc. of Northern Europe.

The Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, located in Northwestern Germany and named for its capital city, existed from 1180 until 1918. In 1871, Oldenburg joined the German Empire. In 1893, a canal was built, connecting the city of Oldenburg to the North Sea, and as a result, the city became a commercial center of great economic importance. In 1918, the Duchy became a Free State within the Weimar Republic.

The postal service of Oldenburg was
originally in the hands of the Counts of
[Thurn and Taxis](../thurn-and-taxis/Introduction), but when it was annexed
to the French crown in 1811 that
service was put an end to. When the
duchy was restored by the Congress of
Vienna in 1815, after the fall of Napoleon,
it provided a postal administration
of its own. In 1851 it joined the German-
Austrian Postal Union and, as one
of the rules of the Union required the
adoption of postage stamps by the contracting
states, Oldenburg immediately
made preparation for the issue of suitable
labels. The postal rates required
three values 1, 2, and 3 silbergroschen
respectively, and these were somewhat
difficult to express owing to the fact that
the currency, like that of [Bremen](../bremen/Introduction), consisted
of a thaler of 72 grote, each of which was divided into 5 schwaren. In
the other countries belonging to this
Postal Union the thaler was divided into
30 silbergroschen. It was decided to express
the values in fractions of a thaler,
1 silbergroschen (1/30 thaler) being
equal to 2 2/5 grote; 2 silbergroschen
(1/15 thaler) being equal to 4 4/5 grote;
and 3 silbergroschen (1/10 thaler) being
equal to 7 1/5 grote. These three
stamps were first placed on sale on January
5th, 1852. The 1 silbergroschen
stamp was for letters weighing up to 1
loth (ounce) sent not more than 10 German
miles within the confines of the
grand-duchy; the 2 silbergroschen was
for letters sent more than 10 miles ; and
the 3 silbergroschen value was for heavier
letters and also for those sent to
points outside Oldenburg. The 1 silbergroschen
was also used for the registration
fee and, from 1858, represented the
single letter rate to any place within the
grand-duchy.

In 1855 a new value, 1/3 silbergroschen
or 4 schwaren, was issued for use on
packages of printed matter up to one
ounce in weight.

In 1857 the coinage was altered to conform
with that of the other members of
the Postal Union, the thaler now being
divided into 30 groschen of 12 schwaren
each. A new set of four values appeared
in 1859 showing values in groschen. The
next change took place in 1861 when it
was decided to dispense with colored
papers and have colored impressions on
white paper. At the same time two new
values were added to the set a J/2gr for
the reduced local or "drop" letter rate,
and Vtgr to assist in making up the fractional
rates on letters to foreign countries.

This value was dropped in February
of the following year as its use
was rather restricted and where the fractional
rates necessitated it the next higher
value, l/2gr had to be used. The adoption
of uniform colors for equivalent
values among the various members of
the Union necessitated another issue in
1862 and this remained in use until January
1st, 1868, when Oldenburg joined
the North German Confederation.
In 1853 Prussia acquired about a quarter
of a square mile of the territory of
Oldenburg at the mouth of the river
Jade for a naval port, now called Wilhelmshafen,
for a consideration of $375,-
000, but it was stipulated that Prussian
stamps should only be used on letters
forwarded by sea. Prussian official correspondence
was forwarded free but all
other mail matter passing over the postal
routes of the grand-duchy had to be
franked with Oldenburg stamps. It is important
to remember that the Oldenburg stamps were only used in the grand duchy
proper and not in the principalities
of Lubeck and Birkenfeld.

By an agreement, dated August 17th,
1845, and by a Customs Convention dated
January 16th, 1864, the postal service of
Lubeck was transferred to Denmark,
which then possessed sovereign powers
in the neighbouring Duchy of Holstein.
The postal revenue went to Denmark and
Danish stamps were used there until
1864. Then the stamps of Schleswig-
Holstein were used, and from 1866 those
of Prussia.

Prussia also had charge of the postal
administration of Birkenfeld, by the
terms of a convention dated April 4th,
1837. Prussian stamps were used and
Oldenburg received the sum of $450 annually
as compensation for the loss of
postal revenue.

The Grand Duchy of Oldenburg issued its first postage stamps in 1852, with another larger stamp of similar design issued in 1855. The four denominations featured the arms of Oldenburg, with a crown above, and a center tablet, with the denomination printed on it. The stamps were lithographed and imperforate, and they were printed in black on colored papers. There are multiple types of the 1/30 Th. and 1/15 Th. denominations.

In 1859, a new series of postage stamps was issued, which had a little more ornate design, featuring a crown over arms in the middle, with the name and denominations on ribbons, at the top and bottom of the postage stamps. Like the 1852 issue, these were printed in black on colored papers.

In 1861, modified designs similar to the 1859 postage stamps, were issued. There were six denominations, and these were printed in different colors on white paper.

Forgeries and fake cancellations are plentiful on the issues from 1852 to 1861. The buyer should be cautious, when buying any of these, especially the high priced canceled stamps. In collecting these, having a copy of the Serrane Guide handy would be an excellent idea!


In 1862, a set of new, embossed designs, was issued. The five denominations were embossed in various colors, and they were rouletted 11 1/2. In 1867, the same values were re-issued, but with gauge 10 rouletting. Forged cancellations are frequently found on the 1867 issue.

At the beginning of 1868, German States stamps of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg were replaced by those of the North German Confederation.
