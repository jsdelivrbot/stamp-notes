\chapter{Stamps and Postal History of Oldenburg}

Prior to the North German Confederation, German States stamps were issued by most of the separate Germanic kingdoms, duchies, free-cities, etc. of Northern Europe.

The Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, located in Northwestern Germany and named for its capital city, existed from 1180 until 1918. In 1871, Oldenburg joined the German Empire. In 1893, a canal was built, connecting the city of Oldenburg to the North Sea, and as a result, the city became a commercial center of great economic importance. In 1918, the Duchy became a Free State within the Weimar Republic.

The Grand Duchy of Oldenburg issued its first postage stamps in 1852, with another larger stamp of similar design issued in 1855. The four denominations featured the arms of Oldenburg, with a crown above, and a center tablet, with the denomination printed on it. The stamps were lithographed and imperforate, and they were printed in black on colored papers. There are multiple types of the 1/30 Th. and 1/15 Th. denominations.

In 1859, a new series of postage stamps was issued, which had a little more ornate design, featuring a crown over arms in the middle, with the name and denominations on ribbons, at the top and bottom of the postage stamps. Like the 1852 issue, these were printed in black on colored papers.

In 1861, modified designs similar to the 1859 postage stamps, were issued. There were six denominations, and these were printed in different colors on white paper.

Forgeries and fake cancellations are plentiful on the issues from 1852 to 1861. The buyer should be cautious, when buying any of these, especially the high priced canceled stamps. In collecting these, having a copy of the Serrane Guide handy would be an excellent idea!


In 1862, a set of new, embossed designs, was issued. The five denominations were embossed in various colors, and they were rouletted 11 1/2. In 1867, the same values were re-issued, but with gauge 10 rouletting. Forged cancellations are frequently found on the 1867 issue.

At the beginning of 1868, German States stamps of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg were replaced by those of the North German Confederation.
