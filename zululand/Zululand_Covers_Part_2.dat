Frytchley, Sanitary Inspector at Durban, marked "Envelopes & stamps unobtainable on active service", countersigned "Free, J. Nolan. Commanding Pioneers. Col. Clarkes Column" and with light Natal c.d.s. on face, Durban c.d.s. (18.8) on reverse; the letter headed "Ulundi" with interesting contents and describing the Ulundi battlefield one month after the event with "many corpses of men and horses scattered about". Photo 

Note: This entire letter provides an interesting insight into the activities of No. 1 Company of the Naval Native Pioneers. It tells of the building of a fort at Conference Hill, under Gen. Newdgate's 2nd. Division. The Company was seconded to Wood's Flying Column and took part in the fighting at the battle of Ulundi. Due to high praises that Gen. Wood bestowed upon this company, instead of being transferred back to Durban, they were instead seconded to Col. Clarke's Column involved in mopping up operations and the ultimate collapse of King Cetshwayo kaMpande
