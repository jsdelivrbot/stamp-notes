\chapter{Postal Fiscals}    

In June 1891 the supply of 1d. stamps of the first issue became exhausted and for a time the then current 1d. Natal revenue stamp overprinted "ZULULAND" was used as a postage stamp. The overprint corresponds exactly with that upon the British stamp, and was applied by Messrs. De La Rue and Co. in London. The stamps had of course been in use some time for fiscal purposes, and it was only owing to the temporary shortage of the ordinary 1d. stamps that they were allowed to be used for postage.

\end{marginfigure}
These 1d. revenue stamps were printed from plate 2 of the De La Rue general plates (the same as were used for teh postage stamps of Cyprus, etc.) and they are therefore all Die I. The printing head-plate consisted of 120 stamps arranged in two panes of 60 (ten horizontal row of 6) side by side. The duty-plate, on the contrary, may have consisted of 60 or 120 facsimiles of the words "NATAL REVENUE" and "ONE PENNY". 

The 1d. postage stamp is usually treated as a fiscal used for postage, but, as a matter of fact, it is an undoubted provisional postage stamp, as teh following Proclamation from the Natal Government Gazette of June 30, 1891 proves:

ZULULAND, Nov. IV., 1891

It is not certain as to how longthis provisional remained in use, but the London Philatelist for march 1982, the following appeared: "When the stock of 1d. on Natal revenue is exhausted, teh 1d. English will be issued surcharged as before." 

It is stated taht 120,224 of these surcharged 1d. Natal stamps were sold altogether, but it is impossible to state how many of these were used fiscally and how many for postal purposes.

The stamp is extremely rare on cover (Figure~\ref{fiscal}).

Although as seen earlier the only value authorized for postage was the 1d, there is no doubt (Poole) that other values of teh revenue series were also legitimately used for the defrayment of postal charges from time to time.
