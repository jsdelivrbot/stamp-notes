\chapter{The First Issue}

The Proclamation of the annexation of Zululand was dated 17th May, 1887 and was signed by General A.E. Havelock, the then Governor of Natal. It ran as follows:

\begin{letter}
Now, therefore, I do hereby proclaim, and make known, that from and after the nineteenth day of May next, the whole of Zululand, including the territory known as the Zulu Reserver Territory, but excluding the territory known as the New Republic, and bounded as follows: On the south and south-west by the Colony of Natal; on the west and north-west by the New Republic; on the north by Amatongaland; and on the east by the Indian Ocean, shall be and shall be taken to be a British possession under the name of Zululand."
\end{letter}

Tweleve months passed after the formal annexation of the territory until provisions were made by the authorities for the issue of special stamps for Zululand. 

The ararngements were announced in the Natal Government Gazette for May 15th, 1888 in the form of a proclamation stating that the postal arrangements into by Sir. A Havenlock, Governor of Natal, with the Resident Commissioner of Zululand, had come into force on the first of that month. It was stated that (1) All letters, etc. posted in Natal and addressed to places in Zululand, shall be prepaid by postage stamps issued by the Government of Natal; and (2) All letters, etc., posted in Zululand and addressed to places in Natal, shall be prepaid by postage stamps issued by the Government of Zululand. Other clauses related to the postal charges on letters, etc., addressed to places in SOuth Africa outside Natal and Zululand, or to the United Kingdom or foreign countries. So far as places in South Africa were concerned, postage was paid in Zululand stamps, and the revenue accruing from tehir sale was credited to taht territory; but on mail matter sent to the United Kingdom or elsewhere by sea, postage was, I presume, also paid by means of Zululand stamps, but the whole credit for this had to be given to the Government of Natal.
