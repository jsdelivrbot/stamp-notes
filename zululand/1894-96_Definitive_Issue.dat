\chapter{1894-96 Definitive Issue}

After using stamps of a more or less provisional character for six years, the Zululand authorities at last made arrangements to issue a permanent series. It is difficult to state the exact date of issue of this series, owing to the many conflicting statements that have been published. In the philatelic journals of the period, the whole set was first of all chronicled; then it was stated that only certain values have been issued, while according to the official proclamation, printed below, all but the 2s. 6d. value were issued on April 18, 1894.

\subsection{The 2s 6d. stamp}

The requisistion for the new Two Shilling and Sixpence duty for Zululand in the Universal Unified Keyplate design (Easton p.566) was sent by the Crown Agent on November 19, 1895. De La Rue submitted a specimen the next day, but this was rejected by the Cown Agents: 'the 2 is shown considerably larger than the 6. We require you to furnish a specimen with the figures drawn as nearly as possible the same size'. 
As it was the stamp was issued still with the  6 being higher than the figure 2. A die proof dated "17 dec 95" is shown in Figure~\ref{2s6d}. 

The revised specimen was approved on November 27th and 12,000 stamps with 750 Specimens were invoiced on January 9, 1896.

The first supplies of all values, except the 2ds. 6d., were printed from plate 1. The 2s. 6d. and suplies of the \half d. and 1d. printed in 1896 were produced from plate 2.

The stamp did not have a very long life , for before they had been in use for five years Zululand was annexed to the Colony of Natal. This was announced in a Proclamation by Sir W.F. Hely Hutchinson, which appeared in the Natal Government Gazette for December 29, 1897, and in which it was stated "that form and after Thursday, the thitieth day of December, 1897, the said territory, or possession of Zululand shall be annexed to and form part of the Colony of Natal."

Evidently the stamps were not at once withdrawn from sale, but the following postal notice, published in the Natal Government Gazette for February 15, 1898, marks the end of the career of Zululand as a separate stamp issuing country.

\heading{POSTAL NOTICE}

It is hereby notified that the Zululand Postage and Revenue stamps hitherto in use will remain on issue at the Post Office at Eshowe until the 30thday of June next, on which date they will be withdrawn from sale.
