# Postal History of the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879

The Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 generated a small number of mail and an even smaller number has survived. The covers are mostly from the military officers involved in the campaign, writing back to their families in Britain. Letters were probably delivered by horse to the base offices and then through Natal by Steamer to their destination. The rate for a letter to the United Kingdom was 6d for Officers or the public, but soldier's could send mail at 1d a letter.

Natal has a humid climate and the realities of the battleground has resulted in the surviving correspondence to be of rather poor quality.
