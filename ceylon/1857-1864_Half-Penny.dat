\chapter{1857-1864 Half Penny}

kkk\cite{chapman-75}
The die\cite{options} for the halfpenny De La Rue adhesive was engraved by Joubert de La Ferte and the stamps printed by typography in sheets of 120 (12 X 10). The first printing only was made on unwatermarked glazed blued paper - the blueing being more regular than was the case for the Perkins, Bacon sixpence - all subsequent printings being on white paper. Both die and plate proofs are recorded. (See \bibentry{options}.)\cite{cor186}.\cite{ceylon}

Unlike the Perkins, Bacon imperforates, two forms of specimen overprint are known, one in large serifed capitals struck diagonally and measuring 21mm and the other struck horizontally in thinner plain capitals measuring 15 x 5mm. This is the only value of the imperforate period that has been recorded with SPECIMEN\cite{agabeg} overprint (Samuel Type D2), though reference is made in Robson Lowe's Encyclopaedia Vol III to the l0d so overprinted. If such exists, it was probably applied by De La Rue to surplus stocks of imperforates known to have been handed over at the termination of the Perkins, Bacon contract. The 1/2 penny "SPECIMEN" is illustrated in Figure~\ref{halfpenny:specimen}; the stamp was originally in the Pearson sale in 1983 and re-appeared in the market at the Hackmey Collection.
