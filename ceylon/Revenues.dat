For many hundreds of years the arms of the Exchequer\cite{options} have reached out towards the pockets of the citizens to take money to meet the cost of government. From birth to death few can escape the activities of the taxman.\cite{hackmey1}, \cite{agabeg}

Down the ages this government revenue has been collected in a variety of ways but, in later times, to improve accounting control and to facilitate collection, most countries have adopted the use of stamps, labels or handstamped markings for this purpose. It is these objects (revenue or fiscal stamps) that members of The Revenue Society of Great Britain collect, study, classify, research, write about and display. Furthermore,
because we are all philatelists, we examine the various methods of production and study how the processes influence the appearance of the stamps These stamps and labels take many varied forms, but they all have this in common - they are issued by
International, National or Local Governments, their licencees or agents, and are indicative that a tax, fee or
duty has been paid or that a permission has been granted. The stamps must, therefore, be studied in
conjunction with the legal authority for their issue, the rates of duty and methods of use.\cite{bayardo98}

The uses of fiscal stamps are extensive, and only a small selection of the revenue stamps issued worldwide
from the 17th century to the present day were shown. Nevertheless, the purpose of this account is to
demonstrate the scope of revenue stamp collecting.

\section{Introduction to Revenues}

The use of stamps for collecting government revenue originated in the Netherlands in the early part of the 17th century as the result of a prize competition for a new type of tax.\cite{revenues} The selected scheme required certain legal documents to be written on stamped (taxed) paper. This idea was copied in England when an Act of 1694 imposed our first stamp duties.

Frame 1 began with some early receipts, and an interesting letter of 1589 relating to Customs Duties. The first embossed stamps, in Frame 2, were uninked; some were for general use, but some were later appropriated to special duties such as receipts.

Stamps could be embossed directly on to paper, but it was impossible to emboss parchment or vellum satisfactorily, so an alternative method, called 'escutcheoning' was used for these documents. The procedure is described in a Report issued by De La Rue in 1901:

\begin{blockquote}
"The vellum must be prepared by rubbing the surface where the escutcheon will fall with smooth pumice-stone, so as
to remove greasiness. The paper escutcheon is then glued to the prepared surface of the vellum. The vellum with the
escutcheon affixed, must then be pierced for the reception of the metal tape. For this purpose the operator places the
portion of the vellum to be pierced on a soft piece of wood, and makes the necessary slits for inserting the metal tape by
means of two blades fixed in a wooden handle. A piece of metal tape is then put through the escutcheon, folded over
on the reverse side of the vellum, and sealed over with a 'cypher label'."
\end{blockquote}

The 'sandwich' of paper (usually blue), vellum and cypher label was then embossed in the normal way.
Cypher Labels (so-called because they all bear the Monarch's Royal Cypher) can form a collection on their
own.
Date plugs were introduced in 1833 as a result of a suggestion by Henry Bessemer of steel-making fame.
Individual dies are identified by a letter, number or emblem, singly or in combination.
Later embossed stamps were inked, Frame 3, and today paper has replaced vellum, so escutcheoning is no
longer necessary. The highest valued embossed revenue stamp issued in Great Britain is ONE MILLION
POUNDS (introduced in 1980) (see illustration).

Copper-plate engraving (intaglio) was a well established printing process for illustrations, and early in the 18th century it was employed by the Stamp Office. A rolling press (Frame 4) was used to print the stamps which relate, for example, to taxes on gloves, hats, almanacs and perfume as well as tickets for post horse hire.

The fear of counterfeiting was always present and Frame 6 showed one of the anti-forgery devices used by
the authorities. Compound-plate printing, patented by Sir William Congreve, was a method of two-colour
printing used from 1820 until 1953 for bank-notes, duty stamps and other security documents as well as for
labels on commercial products. The fine engraving by hand and by machine, combined with perfectly
registered bi-colour patterns, made counterfeiting extremely difficult; however, some successful attempts were
made.

The complex two-part brass printing plates were made and engraved with detailed patterns on a pantograph and a geometric lathe. Both of these machines, built by Bryan Donkin, have recently been restored. No compound-plate printing press has yet been found, though twenty or more are known to have been made by the Bryan Donkin Company and to have been used by Whiting, Perkins, the Stamp Office and Indian Excise Departments. Revenue stamps printed by this method in this country include bank note duty stamps, paper duty labels and stamps for cocoa duty and medicine tax.
