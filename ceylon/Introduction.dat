##Ceylon.


Sri Lanka, known as Ceylon before 22 May 1972, is an island country in South Asia, located about 31 km off the southern coast of India. After over two thousand years of rule by local kingdoms, parts of Sri Lanka were colonized by Portugal and the Netherlands beginning in the 16th century, before control of the entire country passed to Britain around 1796. A nationalist political movement arose in the country in the early 20th century with the aim of obtaining political independence, which was eventually granted by the British after peaceful negotiations in 1948.

\section{The Pre-adhesive Period}

It is possible that a postal service of sorts between Ceylon and India existed early in the seventeenth century, but a private mail service from Holland to Java was adapted in 1789 to give infrequent services to Ceylon via the Cape of Good Hope. So far as I am aware no correspondence has survived from this period, except for occasional letters from British seamen late in the eighteenth century bearing merely a manuscript endorsement 'Off the island of Ceylon'. There is no evidence to show whether any of these were landed on the island and were thence routed to destinations by such postal system as then existed.\cite{agabeg}

The earliest recorded handstruck marking occurs on a soldier's letter dated 1809, routed via the Cape of Good Hope and bearing an apparently handwritten 'Colombo Post Free' marking, contained within a crude circle. I have not myself seen this cover, but a reproduction appears in Robson Lowe's Encyclopaedia Volume III. The cover is countersigned by the Commanding Officer, and passed presumably by private ship to the Cape of Good Hope whence it travelled by the official packet.

The first officially recorded postal arrangement came when the 1815 Act introduced a regular Packet Service to and from India, later that year extended to Ceylon. Packet mails were made up monthly, and the charge for a single letter in either direction was 3s 6d per £oz; this covered charges from port to port in the case of Indian mail, and presumably the same applied to Ceylon. Three covers of this period have so far been recorded, each bearing an oval handstruck 'CEYLON - PACKET LETTER' mark with date, month and year included. It is recorded further for mail to India that private ships could also be used at a charge of Is 2d from England to India, and 8d per letter in the opposite direction. I am not yet sure if the same facility applied to Ceylon; certainly I have not yet recorded any relevant correspondence.

This was superseded in July 1819 by the introduction of the India ship letter rate of 4d per letter (up
to 3oz) from port to port (internal postal charges at either end extra), and from 1820 onwards a series of
locally made paid handstamps were brought into use for external mail. The first was issued at Colombo,
and this was quickly followed by similar markings for Galle, Kandy and Trincomalee, each comprising
the words 'POST PAID' with town-name, date, month and year contained within a frame of varying
shape, the whole surmounted by an imperial crown. The number of types decribed in earlier articles may
be excessive as it is believed that flexible wire was used for the frame, and this easily distorted during use.
At about the same period, a further type was introduced, comprising straight-lined town name handstamp
(in capital letters), together with the words 'POST PAID' applied by separate handstamp. The
overall length of the latter varies from 37mm to 40mm. This mark has been record for KANDY,
GALLE, JAFFNA, BATTICALOA, NUWERAELLIA and MATURA.

The year 1837 saw the introduction of an overland route via Egypt to Falmouth, earlier mail having been routed via the Cape of Good Hope, and later in 1843 the port of entry to the United Kingdom changed from Falmouth to Southampton. In the succeeding twenty or so years, many more types were
introduced and used up to the introduction of the adhesives in 1857, but it is not the intention of this
paper to detail the postal history of the pre-adhesive period. Suffice it to say that these included Franks,
paid, unpaid and ship-letter stamps.* One item deserves special mention. This, dated Colombo,
12 August 1842, is a pre-printed application for life assurance issued by and addressed to the Eagle
Life office in London, obviously the fore-runner of today's Eagle Star Insurance Company. It relates
to life insurance on the life of Edward Rawden Power, a Civil Servant, and contains a fully documented  attestation both by an independent third party and the applicant's medical attendant. A manuscript
endorsement by the local agent confirms receipt of a premium of £24 2s 6d on a sum assured of £500,
being at the rate of £4 16s 6d per cent plus £2 for the policy stamp.

Postal rates during the pre-adhesive period are variable and ill-defined. Most of the known correspondence
was to the United Kingdom and Europe, a high proportion of the former from British
missionaries. Charges, especially by the overland route, were in many cases excessive and I possess, or
have seen, rates as high as 6s 8d for a single letter. If these rates, upgraded to allow for inflation, were
more widely known by the general public, there might be less criticism of today's costs which, much of
the time, ensure safe delivery in one-twentieth of the time typical of the 1840s.

\section{British colony stamps}

The first stamps for Ceylon were issued on 1 April 1857.[1] The stamp features a portrait of Queen Victoria and is brown in colour. It is a 6 pence value used to send a half ounce letter from Ceylon to England. Eight more stamps were issued in year 1857, all featuring the portrait of Queen Victoria. One of the 5 stamps that were issued on 23 April 1859 is considered to be the most valuable stamp in Sri Lanka: it is a 4 pence with a dark pink colour known as the 'Dull Rose'.

No attempt was made to introduce adhesives until May 1854, the year in which a new rate of 6d per 1/2 oz. was introduced for mail carried by the British Packet to Plymouth or Southampton. An order for 60,000 6d adhesives was placed with Perkins, Bacon, was invoiced by the printers on 26 July 1855, and arrived in Colombo in mid-December. However, despite regular local demand and criticism throughout 1856, adhesives were not issued until 1 April 1857, though no reason for the delay appears to have been recorded.

This first consignment of the 6d value was issued imperforate, and was printed in a shade of purplebrown on irregularly blued paper watermarked star. Further orders for additional values followed between 1 August 1856 and 4 June 1858, and were placed on sale as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
2 July 1857 - 5d, l0d, 1s\\

23 August 1857 - 1d, 2d\\

23 April 1859 - 4d, 8d, 9d, 1s 9d, 2s\\
\end{verbatim}

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../ceylon/SG1-proof.jpg}
\caption{Proof of the 6d. purple brown.}
\end{marginfigure}

Postal stationery envelopes bearing an embossed head of Queen Victoria in various frames were also
ordered and issued for all values at about the same time; most values were printed in shades similar to
the adhesives, except for the Is which was printed in yellow. To the best of my knowledge only the Id,
2d, 6d and possibly the 9d have survived as complete envelopes in postally used condition. Only 4,000
each of the 4d, 5d, 8d, Is, Is 9d and 2s were printed and probably even fewer of the 9d. Supplies of the
Id and 2d ordered from Perkins, Bacon, were in fact subcontracted by them to De La Rue, and perhaps
for this reason supplies arrived in the island on 20 May 1857, some three months before the adhesives.
One further adhesive - the halfpenny - required specifically for an inland newspaper rate was issued
in October 1857. The contract to supply was given to De La Rue, rather than Perkins, Bacon, and 60,000
adhesives were prepared, printed on regularly blued unwatermarked paper and issued imperforate. It is
interesting in this connection to note that the use of this special newspaper rate in Ceylon predated
similar use in the United Kingdom by as much as thirteen years.

\section{Proofs}

Dies for the Id, 2d, 5d, 6d, lOd, and Is were engraved by William Humphreys, and consisted of the
name Ceylon above the Queen's Head surrounded by a frame of variable design incorporating the value.

The design for the Queen's Head was taken from an original water-colour by Edward Henry Corbould.

By contrast, the octagonal design for the 4d, 8d, 9d, Is 9d and 2s utilised a transfer from the frame die
of the 1855 Tasmania 6d, the words TASMANIA and SIX PENCE being over-engraved by engine
turning. The die for the Queen's Head was taken from that in use for the contemporary stamps of the
Ionian Islands which had been engraved by Charles Henry Jeens. Die Proofs of all values were struck
in black, probably six of each and residual traces of the words TASMANIA and SIX PENCE can still
be clearly seen beneath the engine turning in the octagonal design.

Recess-printed imperforate plate proofs in black were prepared by Perkins, Bacon, for all values on unwatermarked paper, and it has been recorded that only one sheet of 240 of each value was so prepared.

I am not however, convinced that this is correct, and believe that at least two sheets must have been made for some, if not all values. Such proofs are occasionally found in relatively large connected pieces and in the case particularly of the 6d, these have served to confirm the positions of the major re-entries on stamps no 6 and 215. The 6d also exists imperforate in approximately the issued colour on slightly blued unwatermarked paper. Such proofs have been used to fake unused copies of the issued stamps by the addition of a fraudulent watermark.

\phl[30%]{../ceylon/SG1.jpg}{ }

The die for the halfpenny De La Rue adhesive was engraved by Joubert de La Ferte and the stamps
printed by typography in sheets of 120 (12 X 10). The first printing only was made on unwatermarked
glazed blued paper - the blueing being more regular than was the case for the Perkins, Bacon sixpence -
all subsequent printings being on white paper. Both die and plate proofs are recorded, and unlike the
Perkins, Bacon imperforates, two forms of specimen overprint are known, one in large serifed capitals
struck diagonally and measuring 21mm and the other struck horizontally in thinner plain capitals
measuring 15 • 5mm. This is the only value of the imperforate period that I have recorded with SPECIMEN
overprint, though reference is made in Robson Lowe's Encyclopaedia Vol III to the lOd so overprinted.
If such exists, it was probably applied by De La Rue to surplus stocks of imperforates known
to have been handed over at the termination of the Perkins, Bacon contract. 

Covers with the first issue are rare. The first recorded cover appears to be (Figure~\ref{barondeworms}) a cover dated 11 July 1858 and was originally in the Baron de Worms collection. It is addressed to London and bears a 6d. purple-brown. It last appeared in the Hackmey sale.

Much has already been recorded on these first imperforate issues, and other values issued in the 1857-
59 period, and the great rarity of some, especially in unused condition, is well known. A number of
plating studies have been undertaken in the past, but the fact that I have only studied these issues for
five years prevents my adding usefully to this field of study. I am therefore restricting myself in this
period to a number of notes relating to shades of colour, a listing reflecting the relative availability of
connected pieces, and relevant earliest recorded dates of use. These notes cannot possibly be exhaustive
and their value lies in the hope that they may stimulate others to offer additional information and
critical comment which may extend the record of knowledge in this field.

\section{Shades}

No distinguishable shades have been recorded for the £d, 6d on blued paper, 8d, lOd, or 2s. Such differences
as exist are probably due to fading or climatic change, and do not in my opinion, constitute
separate printings.

\section{One Penny and Twopence}

Blue and deep blue clearly exist as distinctive shades of the one penny, similarly the twopence is recognised
in yellow-green and deep green. The one penny also appears to exist in a pale blue shade and is
recorded on blued paper, though I have not seen a copy of the latter where the blueing is visible on the
back. (A strip of three is recorded as being offered by auction in London some years ago.) In each case,
the evidence of covers and dated pieces suggests that the deeper shade was the earliest printing.
Fivepence
Used examples clearly show evidence of a regular chestnut shade and a deep chestnut. I have not yet
seen the latter unused but I do not think it can have been caused by any climatic condition. It is more
probably due to over-inking, or to printing at a time when the ink had stood for some period after
mixing, thus allowing the heavier components to sink and so vary the composition of the ink mixture
actually used.

\section{Sixpence}

Purple-brown, brown and deep brown shades are recognised, and the evidence of dated copies available
suggests they may have been printed in that order.
The purple-brown shade appears capable of sub-division into pale and deep shades, the former being
recognised by a definite reddish tint. Similarly there appear to be two shades of brown, one of which has
a reddish tint, whilst the other I describe as a chocolate brown. The deep brown shade is quite distinctive
and incidentally rarely found.

\section{One Shilling}

Some catalogues record both violet and deep lilac shades, and used copies I have seen certainly appear
to substantiate this classification. However, colours at the short-wave end of the visible spectrum are so
susceptible to change under the influence of bright sunlight and water immersion that I am disinclined
to accept two shades merely on the evidence of used examples. Very few unused copies have survived,
certainly too few for classification purposes, and it may be that this question will remain unanswered
indefinitely.

Fourpence
Two distinct shades are found, a genuine deep rose, and a much paler duller shade. Again I believe the
latter represents fading under the influence of bright sunlight.
Ninepence
Two shades are evident, a deep purple-brown and a lighter shade with a distinct reddish tinge. I do not
believe either could be the result of climatic change, and since only 9,800 were invoiced, separation of
the ink components on standing may be the right explanation.
One Shilling and Ninepence
Green and yellow-green shades are recorded. Only 5,000 were printed imperforate and I therefore
believe the explanation for these to be the same as for the ninepence value.
