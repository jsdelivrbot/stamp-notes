The campaign in German East Africa was not vigorously pursued until 1916. Eralier
incidents took place on the northern frontiers of enemy territory as soon as the outbreak of the war in Europe.

Fighting continued from 1916 onwards and it was not until the armistice in 1918 that the German commander actually surrendered his forces, though by the ned of 1917
the whole of German east Africa (G.E.A) was virtually in British and Belgian hands.

The special issue of stamps was sanctioned for the use of the forces was available in 1916.

Indian troops formed the bulk of the force. The Nyasa-Rhodesian element was 
commnaded by General Northey and the G.O.C. East Africa Force (Lieut.-general Sir Robert Wapshare) 
controlled operations in which Belgian Congo troops co-operated.

##The Field Post Offices

You can collect postal history for either the __postal__ or the __history__. Personally I prefer the latter and
the Nyasa-Rhodesian force presents itself perfectly for the latter.

The double circle F.P.O. numbers from 1-9 and there are basically five types.

The Germans will not stand, retiring as fast as they can whenever we get any where near them.' Ex Lambert. Photo.
