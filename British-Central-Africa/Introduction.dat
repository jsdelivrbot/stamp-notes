## Nyasaland Protectorate (Formerly known as British Central Africa)

###Postal History

The first postal service was the unofficial runner service initiated to carry mail from the missionary stations
around the south of lake Tanganyika and the northe of Lake Nyasa.

The mail went by runner through {{wi:Nyasaland}} to Lake Nyasa which crossed by steamer, then by runners to the Shire River, from 
whence the mail was carried by steamer to Chinde.

In 1891 the Imperial post opened its first post office at {{wi: Chiromo}} and {{wi:Port_Herald}}.
In 1893 the postal service was greatly extended throughout the British South africa Company's territory in British Central Africa and the
following post offices opened in 1893 or 1894 in what later became the protectorate: Blantyre, Tshinded (later Chinde), .

The growth of the postal service in the protectorate followed closely that of Northern Rhodesia with which it was closely connected.

During the shortage of the 1d. adhesive from March to November 1898 covers with the manuscript __Postage Paid__
were used. 

The stamps of countris such as Nyasaland are attractive, because the range is small. besides
