###1903 King edward VII Definitive Set

many collectors find the stamps of {{wi:King_Edward_VII}} dull and uninteresting. True they provide very little
varieties for the traditional philatelist, interested in classical philately. If one extends the collection
to include the 'printing story' they become a challenge. The colour trials were mad on the 1d and 2/6 on CA paper.
The id. stamp was used for the first colour trial and was printed in no less than 19 colours. Hunting for these
can become a challenge. The 2/6 was printed in 18 different colors. we illustrate some of them here, recently
offered in an auction. The same set is also available as specimen.
