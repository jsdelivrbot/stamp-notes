## Nyasaland Protectorate (Formerly known as British Central Africa)

###1934-35 Leopards

#### By Dr Y Lazarides

EARLY in 1933 permission was given to the Nyasaland Protectorate to introduce a new
series of postage and revenue stamps to supersede the standard keyplate type which had
been in use since 1908. The bare record in Gibbons' reads 'Type 17. King George V and
Symbol of the Protectorate. Designed Major H. E. Green. Recess. Waterlow. 1934 (June)
-1935.' The long period between sanction being given for the introduction of a new design
and its emission suggests that gestation was not without complications and such is indeed
the case.

At the end of March 1933 the Crown Agents received, via the Colonial Office, seven
water colour sketches approximately stamp size together with a much enlarged sketch
showing the Nyasaland Government's proposals for the projected issue. Within a few days
the Crown Agents reported to the Colonial Office. They suggested certain difficulties in
reproducing the proposed design and recommended recess printing to obtain the strength

of colour desired. They also pointed out the impractibility of printing the sun's rays in
two colours due to difficulties with registration. (This apparently refers to the 1s duty.)

These criticisms were conveyed to the Nyasaland Government and elicited a memorandum
dated, 12 June 1933 in which Major Green wrote 'The whole idea of my design is to avoid
shaded effects, sharp and distinct contrast is what is aimed at.' Major Green's enlarged
design apparently showed the King's head, leopard, rock and sun's rays in white against
a deep blue background in the upper portion of the stamp and the inscription 'Nyasaland'
in white against a very dark blue background at the foot. This memorandum reached the
Crown Agents on 10 August and on the 29th they reported to the Colonial Office, adhering
to their original view that recess printing was the best method but stating that they were
prepared to obtain the stamps produced by photogravure which apparently was the process
favoured by Major Green.


### POSTSCRIPT

During the preparation of the 'Leopard' issue regular external airmail services had been
introduced in Nyasaland the inaugural mail being despatched on 7 March 1934. The rate
for half ounce letters to Southern Rhodesia was four pence and to the United Kingdom
one shilling. When the projected rates were announced to the public there was considerable
outcry at the charge to the UK. The authorities evidently bowed to public opinion and in
March 1934 indented for two further duties in the 'Leopard' design, 4d stipulated to be in
reddish brown and lOd in black. There was again considerable correspondence; the colours
selected were thought to be too close to other duties in the series. The Nyasaland Government
apparently had second thoughts on the matter both as regards colours and the UK
air rate for at the beginning of February 1935 an order was placed with Waterlows for a
4d stamp in bright magenta and a 9d in olive-bistre. Waterlows charged £45 for engraving
the new value dies and preparing the printing plates compared with the original cost of
£150 for the six single colour plates. The stamps were placed on sale on 20 May 1935.

The period during which the nine pence rate was in force has not been traced - information
on this point would be welcomed - but by October 1935 the airmail rate to the
United Kingdom was further reduced to seven pence per half ounce. No stamp of this duty
was issued. Covers showing the nine pence rate are extremely scarce.
