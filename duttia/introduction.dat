# The Stamps and Postal History of Duttia


Duttia also spelled Datia on the later postage stamp issues, was a state in Bundelkhand.\footnote{Bundelkhand is a region in central India. The region is now divided between the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, with the larger portion lying in M.P.
The region was the site of the ancient Chedi Kingdom.} The state was comprised of scattered rather than compact areas totaling 846 square miles and a population of 160,000. The stamps of Duttia show the Hindu elephant god Ganesh, patron of shopkeepers and merchants.

The Maharaja held a high position among the feudatory chiefs of India, and was entitled to a salute of 15 guns. It appears that this State has had a post and postage stamps of its own since 1893. It has one Head Office and nine Branch offices. Each Branch office rendered daily accounts to the Head Office, and the Head Office rendered a monthly account to the State Treasury. The Postmaster of Duttia (State) Office was head of the postal administration, subject to inspection at irregular intervals by one of the higher Durbar officials.

The State Post dealt with paid and unpaid letters, post-cards, packets, registered articles, and parcels. Official articles are carried free, but postage stamps, stamped envelopes and post-cards are available for private correspondence. The greater part of the contents of the mails consists, of course, of official correspondence. The rates of postage are said to be the same as those prevailing in British India, though there appears to be a quarter anna rate for certain articles besides post-cards.

The stamps were printed at a private press, and an ingenious device was used  to prevent forgery. No stamp, envelope, or post-card was available for prepayment of postage untill it was impressed with the Maharaja's seal. Till this is added the stamp is worthless. When it is added, the stamp is available for prepayment of postage up to the value indicated on it.

Mr. Pigott reports that he had great difficulty in securing any of the State postage stamps or in eliciting any information on the subject. It certainly is curious that any stamps should have been in existence for four years unknown to philatelists.
It now remains to describe the stamps and postal stationery of the State. It seems probable that the present design is not the original one, as one value (1 anna) of the stamps supplied by Mr. Pigott is of a somewhat different and more primitive nature.
