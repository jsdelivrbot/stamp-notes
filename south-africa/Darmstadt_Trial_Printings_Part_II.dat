# The Darmstadt Trial Printings Part II

\section{The Issued Stamp}

The first stamp produced by the Government Printer, Pretoria, following the trials carried out at Darmstadt and the delivery of the Goebel Rotary Printing Machine was issued on 1 May 1930. 

Produced from new cylinders prepared in Pretoria from the original master design and working photographically up to the master negative of four images for the frame with alternate language setting of English and Afrikaans. This formed the basis for production of the cylinder bearing 240 images---i.e., the master negative exposed 60 times.

Certain small characteristics (imperfections) possibly occur in the process and these would reflect in each of the 4 master negative images (Quadruple Die).
There is a definite link between the first issued stamps and the trials carried out at Darmstadt. However, depending on the inks and papers used in the trials, the characteristic is more or less visible.

The issued stamp:

Small white nick in top right frame - occurs on all odd numbered stamps with English language.

Darmstadt trials:

Other Quadruple Die flaws appearing in the stamp from Issues 1 to 6 do not appear in the Darmstadt trial
printings, thus confirming that a new master negative was produced. The absence of the characteristics also
determines without question the trial printings carried out on the 'Official' watermarked paper (Dix Nos 57 & 34).
