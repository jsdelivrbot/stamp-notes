\chapter{1910 Opening of the Union Parliament}

By the assent ot the "South Africa Act, 1909" passed by the parliamanent of the United Kingdom, the four colonies of Cape of Good Hope, Natal, Transvaal and Orange Free State were united under the style of the "Union of South Africa," the four constituent colonies becoming "provinces" of the Union.

The Act came into force on the 31st May 1910, and, pending the issue of stamps for the Union, the stamps of the four Colonies, continued to be used as before that date. In August, 1910, the Government of the Union authorised the used of teh stamps of the four colonies anywhere throughout the Union, until the definitive issue for teh Union could be produced and issued.

On the 4th November 1910, H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, representing His Majesty King George V, opened the first Union Parliament in Cape Town. To commemorate the inauguration, a single stamp of the value of 2\half d was placed on sale. The denomination represented the Universal Postal Union of postage at the time to an overseas destination.
