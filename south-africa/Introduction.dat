\section{South Africa}
The Republic of South Africa, previously The Union of South Africa, is a country located at the southern tip of Africa, with a coastline on the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. To the north lie Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe; to the east are [Mozambique](../mozambique/introduction) and [Swaziland](../swaziland/introduction); while [Lesotho](../lesotho/introduction) is an independent country wholly surrounded by South African territory.

Before South Africa was united in 1910, each South African state issued their own stamps. These were: [British Bechuanaland](../bechuanaland/introduction) (1885-1895), [Cape of Good Hope](../cape-of-good-hope/introduction) (1853-1904), [Griqualand West](../griqualand-west/introduction) (1874-1879), [Natal](../natal/introduction) (1857-1909), [New Republic](../new-republic/introduction) (1886-1887), Orange Free State (Orange River Colony) (1868-1909), South African Republic (Transvaal) (1869-1909), [Stellaland](../stellaland/introduction) (1884-1885) and [Zululand](../zululand/introduction) (1888-1896). 

During the [Boer War](../boer-war/introduction), these towns issued their own provisional stamps: Lydenburg (1900), [Mafeking](../mafeking/introduction) (1900), [Pietersburg](../pietersburg/introduction) (1901), [Rustenburg](../rustenburg/introduction) (1900), [Schweizer Renecke](Schweizer_Renecke_1900) (1900), Volksrust (1902), [Vryburg](../vryburg/introduction) (1899-1900) and Wolmaransstad (1900).

Bright blue and brown, bilingual pair, Center Inverted, a fabulous 
top right corner sheet-margin vertical bilingual pair, with each 
stamp displaying an inverted center, luxuriously rich colors, 
well centered, o.g., the stamps themselves appear to be never hinged, 
vertical perforations separated along right edge, very fine and choice. 
This pair is one of the rarest and most visually striking inverted 
center errors of the entire British Empire. While most of these errors 
are found as single stamps separated from the original discovery multiple, 
very few still exist as intact bilingual pairs - this 
being one of only two such pairs of which we are aware. 
It is conjectured that the size of the sheet margins remaining 
on this pair are larger than those found on the issued stamps, 
leading one to conclude that this might have been from a trial printing. 
Regardless, this stunning pair is one of the most sought after pieces in 
the collecting realm of inverted centers of the world. 
The Stanley Gibbons catalog only lists this error as singles (\pound11,000 each), 
so therefore we have simply cataloged this as two singles, 
without adding any premium for being an intact pair. 
Accompanied by a 1979 BPA certificate (Scott #32c var.). as two singles

\subsection{Union of South Africa (1910-1961)}

The first stamp of the Union of South Africa was a 21\frac21d stamp issued 
on 4 November 1910.[1] It portrayed the monarch King George V and the arms 
of the four British colonies which formed the Union: Cape Colony, Natal, 
Orange River Colony and Transvaal. Most South African stamps issued 
between 1926 and 1951 were in pairs. One was inscribed 'SOUTH AFRICA' 
and the other 'SUIDAFRIKA' or 'SUID-AFRIKA'.

\subsection{Republic of South Africa (1961-)}

The first set of the Republic was issued on 31 May 1961. From 1961 to 1966, 
stamps were inscribed \textsc{"REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA REPUBLIEK VAN SUID-AFRIKA"}. 
However from 1967 stamps were simply inscribed "RSA". Modern issues 
are just inscribed "South Africa".

\subsection{South African Homelands}

The South African homelands of Bophuthatswana (1977-1994), 
Ciskei (1981-1994), Transkei (1976-1994) and [Venda](../venda/introduction) (1979-1994) 
also issued their own stamps.
