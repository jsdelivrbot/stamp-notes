\chapter{Aerial Post}
The first airmail post in South Africa was transported between Kenilworth and Muizenberg during an aviation fortnight held from 21 December 1911 to 3 January 1912.

Souvenir postcards bearing the words “First South African Aerial Post”, pictures of Cape Town and Table Mountain and of an aircraft in flight were issued. These postcards were sold for one shilling, and for the sum of one halfpenny they could be sent to any place in South Africa. All the post cards were sent to Kenilworth or Muizenberg for transportation between these two places by aircraft. They were date-stamped at both places and then circulated by ordinary mail. The number of cards totalled 2,597.

The pilot of the flight was Evelyn “Bok” Driver – the date, 27 December 1911.

The craft was a Bleriot monoplane, similar to that which crossed the English Channel a couple of years before on the 25 July 1909.

Evelyn Frederick (Bok) Driver who flew the first airmail to Muizenberg from Cape Town on 27 December 1911 (with acknowledgement to the South African Railways)

Driver, Captain (later Brigadier-General) Guy Livingstone, and Cecil Compton Paterson (Aviator’s Certificate No 30), in 1911 formed the African Aviation Syndicate ‘to promote the science and practice of aviation in South Africa’.

It had a Paterson biplane and a Bleriot monoplane, and in 1912 acquired another Paterson and Bleriot.

Paterson stayed in the air for 35 minutes, reaching a height of 600 metres above sea level on 25 December 1911, a South African record, only to crash the next day. 

On 27 December 1911 Driver flew the first airmail to Muizenberg from Cape Town, about 13 kilometres (8 miles) away.
