The first series of these stamps were electrotyped by De La Rue & Co. during 1914-1922, all further issues emanated from the Government Printing Works, Pretoria. There were seven values, \half d., 1d., 2d., 3d., 6d., and 1/-, printed from a separate interior (value) plate for each, and only one exterior plate. Each sheet consisted of 120 stamps divided into two panes of 60 910 rows x 6) by a narrow vertical gutter.  They were only issued in panes and bore no plate number. The perforation, gauging 14, was by a single comb which moved upward, and the watermark consisted of a single Springbok's head.
