The 1d. shows a soldier holding the South african flag on a battlefield with the background shown a V sign for "Victory". The 2d. shows an ex-volunteer "putting his hands to the plough", a reference to peace. The 3d shows a man and a woman gazing at a star symbolizing "Hope."

The stamps were printed by the Government Printer, in Pretoria on paper watermarked multiple springbok heads and perforated 14. They were issued in sheets of 120 (20 x 6 units) with the central marginal arrows and sheet numbers twice in red on teh right hand margin.


The stamps were printed in large quantities and smaler quantities were overprinted to be used in Basutoland, Bechuanaland, swaziland and S.W.A.

On the 2d. there is a "mole-hill" on koppie. (Row1. No.2). A more rare variety is joined paper albino printing. This was a very unusual variety on a sheet of the 2d. value, the bottom centarl fur stamps had been printed on double paper which was held in one piece of mounting. A pefect oblong shape with another resting above its center appears in albino on the bottom row, the covering having taken parts of the stamp impressions.

Lastly, and perhaps the most common is the "Scar" on woman's face variety which occurs on Ro 18, No.1 

Many minor varieties both constanta nd non-constant exist, as well as dryp prints (Figure~\ref{dryprint}).
