\chapter{Darmstadt Trial Printings}

In the late 20's the greatest innovations for stamp manufacturing came from Germany.
Goebel A.G. Darmstadt introduced in 1928 in close cooperation with the Dutch "Nederlandsche Rotogravure Maatschappij" smaller and narrower printing presses for recess and photogravure. The machines were used in 1928 by the Italian State Printers in Rome, in 1929 for the State Printers in Pretoria - South-Africa, in 1936 for the TIEV in Mexico, in 1937 for Moestue, Oslo. All these stamps were produced using photogravure both using screened as well as unscreened cylinders.


On 10 February 1949, Fellows and Members of the Royal Philatelic Society, London were presented with a
display of material by the late Prof Victor W. Dix, FRPSL. It demonstrated his researches into the course of printing
trials that changed the whole concept of stamp production in the Union of South Africa. A supporting paper was
subsequently published in \textit{The London Philatelist} in October 1950. This paper has stood the test of time as the definitive study and catalogue of the trial printings, and is universally accepted for describing any material that appears from time to time.

It is not known if further research or study has been carried out; in any event, nothing has appeared in print.
What follows is the result of an opportunity to study a fairly large quantity of the trial material, together with the
need to 'expose' the controversy on the status of this material.

\section{The story}

Before 1929 the South African Government had decided that, in the future, all its postage stamps should be produced locally, rather than put out to overseas tender. The Government Printing Works in Pretoria was already well established and had been producing the small-format definitive stamps from typographed plates transferred from Waterlow & Sons in London.

The process selected was that of rotary-photogravure, then a relatively new method. The German company,
Goebel AG, of Darmstadt was manufacturing printing plant for this process and an order was placed for a rotaryphotogravure
printing press (Figure 1). This was only the third of its kind, two having been already supplied to
the Italian Government. The acceptance of the plant was dependent on the provision of satisfatory 'samples' of
its capabilities.

A London firm of printers, Hunter Penrose Ltd, was appointed agent of the South Afri£an«Government; HP,
together with a Government representative and a technician* from the Printing Works, were to oversee the
project.
The printing medium - etched cylinders, as opposed to plates - for the new process had to be procured from
a Dutch company, Nederlandsche Rotogravure Maatschapij NV of Leiden, pioneers in the development of this
comparatively new process. The ship design was modified from the original Id ship stamp in 1926.

The contract drawn up between the South African Government and Goebel AG required the provision of
satisfactory trial printings of a stamp to a South African specification for which strict criteria were laid down by
Hunter Penrose Ltd. These criteria were quite specific, stating the method, papers and inks to be used. The printing method chosen was screenless rotary photogravure, a then secret process of the above Dutch company.

Hunter Penrose initially provided a design in the form of a dummy cigarette duty label (Figure 2) for the purpose of testing the inks and papers. Later they provided a 'stamp' design (Figure 3) as a continuation of the trials on the Goebel machine. The cylinders for both these trials were made at Leiden, as were the cylinders for the actual stamp design.

\section{Problems!}

It is clear from the correspondence between the parties that from day one serious problems were encountered, not
helped by lack of co-ordination and non-conformity with the requirements of the contract. The overall result was
an exercise spanning eight weeks from August 1929, during which five different papers were used and a variety
of different combinations of both German and English inks.
The trial printings of the dummy cigarette labels and the dummy stamps proved unsatisfactory mainly with the
inks used (black, red, green, orange and brown) for monocoloured trials. The dummy stamps followed but the
cylinder etched at Leiden had incorrect size designs and it was not thus possible to perforate the finished product.

The inks used were found to be unsuitable for the process. (Ink for screenless printings should be thicker than that used for screened printing.)

\section{Trials of the stamp design}

At the outset of the trial printings of the actual stamp design, the problems continued. The contract clearly
stipulated that a printing of 1,000 sheets of stamps were to be produced using 'officially' watermarked and
gummed paper, and using English inks. It also required selection of one sheet from each 50 to be made at random,
ie 20 sheets in all, which were to be sent to Hunter Penrose for approval. (Official watermarked paper was that
already in use by the Government Printer and carried an all-over watermark of a Springbok's Head.)

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../south-africa/penrose.jpg}
\end{marginfigure}
The first printings comprised examples of the head plate and the frame plate separately, but during some
supplementary etching of the frame plate, the latter was damaged and had to be replaced, causing further delays.


The required replacement cylinder was collected from Leiden and the 1,000 sheets produced.
The gathering of the sample sheets caused yet another dispute as to who was to select them but, as it happened, this was of little consequence. The printing had been made using German inks, on unwatermarked and ungummed paper, thus not in accordance with the contract.

\end{figure*}

Further trials were carried out but the 'official' watermarked paper proved unsuitable. New paper and inks
were ordered. The paper was gummed esparto supplied by Samuel Jones & Co Ltd, London, which was
unwatermarked. Inks continued to give problems and finally Goebel AG were authorised by Hunter Penrose to
use German inks if necessary.
The final trial run was carried out on 8 October 1929 and the sample sheets accepted by Hunter Penrose on 11
October 1929. They were printed on gummed esparto paper without watermark, using English black ink and
German red ink.

This trial-and-error situation resulted in the late Professor Dix identifying seventy-one separate printings from
the Hunter Penrose portfolio.

\section{The initial discovery of the trial printings}

The printing trials were carried out in 1929 but it was another nine years before any reference was made to their
apparent existence. This arose as a result of correspondence23'0 between Scott, the American catalogue publishers,
and the South African Philatelist (SAP). Scott revealed that they had an example of a Id ship design printed by a
Rotogravure process, but on unwatermarked paper. (Union stamps at the time were all printed on a paper with a
watermark of multiple Springbok's head.)
Subsequent correspondence drew widely conflicting theories as to the origin of this variety. One leading
collector at the time suggested a 'fake' - others said that they had been accidentally printed on paper normally
used for the Christmas Charity labels which were also printed at the Government Printing Works, Pretoria.

Perhaps the most bizarre suggestion to be quoted was that the variety emanated from the activities of a former
employee of the Government Printer, then already well known for his 'misdemeanours'!
Later correspondence added observations on the minor characteristics of the design itself, indicating its
resemblance to the 1931 printing of the stamp. Doubts were, however, expressed regarding the gum used.

Theories continued through to the end of 1938, culminating in an opinion that this unwatermarked example was
probably 'leaked' from the Government Printing Works where at the time experiments were being carried out.

The experiments were, in fact, a desire slightly to redraw the design of the 1d stamp to improve the printing qualities.

This was realised in the re-issue of the stamp with wider spaced horizontal lines in the side panels. This is designated as issue 8 by the specialist and classified by SG as Type II - SG 43d.

By March 1939 it had been learnt that a London stamp dealer had acquired a portfolio containing complete sheets of ink trials and imperforated stamps. The origin was not revealed and, by the outbreak of World War II, the subject had faded into obscurity.

\section{The first showing of the material from the trials}

Professor Dix's presentation in 1949, however, revealed the whole story, which completely discounted the earlier theories and speculation. It is very fortunate that the supporting paper was published as it comprises the only detailed record of the exercise destined to change the method by which South Africa was to produce its stamps, which carried on unchanged until 1961. None of the original records have survived.

The background
To appreciate the merits (or otherwise) of the material that has survived, one must know the background to the
experiments and understand why such a lengthy period was involved with what should have been almost 'routine'
testing of equipment.

Professor Dix's paper provided much detail of correspondence between the parties, some of which was quite acrimonious. However, this resume is restricted to the reasons for what appears to have been an excessive number of different trial printings.

\section{The philatelic status of the trials}

Notwithstanding the major exposure of the trials in THE LONDON PHILATELIST in October 1950, controversy as to their
status emerged following the decision by the catalogue editors in South Africa to omit them from the first
Handbook/Catalogue published on 14 March 1952 (the Van Riebeeck Tercentenary Edition). This decision was
made known in a displayed notice in the South African Philatelist in May 1952 following the approval given by
the Philatelic Federation of Southern Africa at their Congress in Cape Town in March 1952 (see Figure 4).

The appearance of this statement did not meet with universal approval and counter-opinions and pressures
were forthcoming for their inclusion in the Union Handbook/Catalogue. Meantime, the Federation had appointed
a special sub-committee to submit a more detailed report. This report was not published until June 19532f under
the heading 'The Darmstadt Labels'. It not only gave a warning, but described the actual stamp trials as replicas,
adding 'there can be no sane reason why collectors of Union stamps should collect this mass of rubbish'.

The report ended by extolling the inclusion in the catalogue of the essay of a 1d stamp design bearing the head of a Springbok as the motif - the now well known 'Booysen' Essay (Figure~\ref{booysenessay}). The report provided the following description:

\begin{letter}
'After the purchase (the Goebel machine) and before it was shipped out, however, Mr J.L. Booysen of the Union Government Printing Works was sent to London, Leiden and Darmstadt to study the process of Rotogravure and whilst at Darmstadt printed certain trials which the Post Office and we regard as official essays because they may be looked upon as a preliminary stage in the printing of Union stamps by rotogravure, the process adopted on the arrival of the Goebel machine. These essays are described on page 79 of the Handbook/Catalogue: they can in no way be mistaken for actual Union Stamps'.
\end{letter}

(The inaccuracies in that statement will emerge as the controversary develops.)

\section{Later reports}

The next report of the Darmstadt Sub-Committee was delayed pending receipt of answers to questions put to the
Minister of Posts. These were published in July 1954 in the form of an official statement. The statement lists
seven numbered points, six of which summarise the Darmstadt exercise. The seventh states:

\begin{blockquote}
'These stamps made at Darmstadt can in no way be considered as an official stamp issue'.
With that information, Congress came to the conclusion that the stamp trials (complete stamps; separate
centre-plate; and frame-plate printings) must be regarded as authorised Trials or Proofs.
\end{blockquote}

The statement went on
to say that the catalogue editors should now include the trials in the Catalogue/Handbook. (No mention was made
of the dummy cigarette duty labels or dummy 'stamps'.)
The report concluded with a brief statement on the 'Booysen Essay', following a report from the Postal Authorities:

\begin{letter}
'Mr Booysen had not been sent to Darmstadt in the first instance by the Government Printer to study the working of the Goebel
machine, but to Leiden to learn the process of etching plates (cylinders) for use on that machine. He had no instructions to print
anything in particular.
'He made an etching of the Essay referred to and ran off copies of it on a small machine in Leiden. There was no Goebel
machine there.'
\end{letter}

Congress therefore came to the view that the so-called 'official' essay was a purely private effort and that the
statement in the Handbook/Catalogue should be amended accordingly.
The Handbook/Catalogue
Volume II of the Handbook/Catalogue appeared in June 1955 with a new chapter on the 'Darmstadt Trials or
Proofs' with the Congress report summary as an introduction. What follows is a fairly extensive listing of the material, including the dummy cigarette duty labels and dummy 'stamps'! The corrected information on the
'Booysen' essay was included as an amendment to Volume I.
Another new Handbook was published in 1960 (the Golden Jubilee Edition). This contained a similar listing,
but the introduction contained reference to the late Professor Dix's article in THE LONDON PHILATELIST. This edition
of the Handbook was reprinted and updated in 1979 without alteration to the 'Darmstadt Trials' chapter.
In 1986 a complete new Union Handbook/Catalogue (Definitive Edition) was published. Gone are the listings
of the Dummy Cigarette Duty Labels, Dummy 'Stamps' and the 'Booysen' essay, omitted in accordance with the
statement from the federation in May 1954!

To sum up, therefore, after a period of some 30-odd years, the Darmstadt Stamp Trials are considered by the
Philatelic Federation of Southern Africa as proofs of the rotogravure-printed Union Id Ship definitive stamp. The Dummy Cigarette Duty Labels, Dummy 'Stamps' and 'Booysen' essay are thus, in the modern collecting jargon, 'Cinderella' material.

\section{Collectability?}

In spite of the finally declared 'status' of the material from the trials, it is still collected and eagerly sought after
by the Union specialist. It is then a matter of personal choice as to how much of the material a collector should
include: either to tell the complete story of the exercise, or just to illustrate the fact that the trials took place as a
forerunner of the first Union stamp to be produced by the rotogravure process.
The initial trials of the Dummy Cigarette Duty Labels from a design prepared by Hunter Penrose Ltd were
instigated to test the capability of the Goebel Printing Machine and its suitability for production of postage stamps
using an unscreened rotogravure process. They were not in any way produced as forerunners to any possible
change in design of the stamp.

The Dummy 'Stamps' were also prepared by Hunter Penrose as part of these initial trials designed to test the inks and papers used. These Dummy 'Stamps' may be likened to similar labels prepared by printers as samples of their wares. Thus, the collectability of these initial trials is clearly put into context.

On the other hand the 'Booysen Essay', however unofficial, would not have been produced had it not been for the Darmstadt exercise.

It has not been ascertained how the design originated by Mr Booysen produced these essays at Leiden from a single cylinder of 80 images, prepared by Nederlandsche Rotogravure Maatschappij NV at Leiden. They were printed on a small press at Leiden in black, brown, purple and blue, on unwatermarked paper. They were imperforate, but the black essay is known with a rough line perforation, gauge 11 '/4, thought to have been done
at Leiden also.

The 'Booysen Essays' are nevertheless collected and very few of the perforated examples have been seen. At best, therefore, they may be considered as being 'as a result of the Darmstadt Trials, and a product of a Government Printing Department training/learning exercise.

\section{Some unanswered questions!}

Where did all the material that found its way onto the market originate? Certainly, some material now in
circulation was that originally owned by the late Professor Dix and from the Hunter Penrose portfolio.

Where are the records, particularly the correspondence between the parties involved?
An attempt to trace the records was made in 1985 by a former editor of the South African Collectors Society,
whilst studying the deliberations of the Federation over the status of the material.
Hunter Penrose Ltd, who acted as agents for the South African Government in 1929/30, still exist although as
Fine Art Printers. An approach was made to them in the hopes of obtaining some information. Not surprisingly
the response indicated that there was no longer anyone on the staff who had been around in 1929, also that the
records of the period were no longer in existence.

They did, however, provide contact with a retired employee, who in turn involved a former colleague. The outcome of communication with these two gentlemen produced one piece of information related to the design of the Dummy Cigarette Duty Labels, which had not been previously recorded. They stated:

\begin{letter}
'It would appear that the commercial artist responsible for the dummy tax label had been instructed to produce it
on the lines of the company letter heading in use at the time. It shows the logos of both Hunters Ltd and A.W.
Penrose & Co and certainly the lettering is the same.


'Hunter-Penrose was formed in 1927 by a merger of Messrs Hunters Ltd of St Brides St, London EC4 and A.W.
Penrose & Co Ltd, of Farringdon Road. The motif in the centre of the label comprises Hunters on the left, an
artist's palette and brushes and A.W. Penrose on the right showing the letter P with a pen and a rose.'
\end{letter}

Additionally, the correspondence revealed that a former Managing Director of the company had formed his own stamp collection, undoubtedly including some of the trials. After his death the collection was sold in auction.*

A re-appraisal of the material from the Trials
A recent study of a fairly large collection of material from the trials was undertaken to try to find a method of
positively identifying the different trials as listed by Professor Dix. A small basic collection from that formed by
Professor Dix has survived intact, each item being clearly linked to the numbers allocated in his initial study.
However, visual comparison in many instances proved inconclusive. This applied particularly to identification of
the different inks.

Modern technical philatelic aids were of little use, both short and long wave ultra-violet lights did not provide an answer. The chemical content of modern printing inks is vastly different to those of the period.

It should be possible to use more advanced methods to identify the inks, eg refraction, but the likelihood of having a large quantity of material to examine is virtually nil and, whilst some of the items are scarce, they cannot be considered as extreme rarities!

The identification of the papers is, however, possible with some degree of certainty when compared with samples of the paper that exist.

The overall study, however, has revealed several characteristics which may be added to the details in Professor
Dix's tables. These mainly relate to watermark positions on the Hunter-Penrose labels and dummy stamps, some
of which were printed on paper watermarked with a clover leaf (trefoil).
One other important feature to emerge is that in spite of the contract stipulating 'unscreened rotogravure'
process several of the dummy labels show up clearly as 'screened' when photographically enlarged, suggesting
use of a diagonal cross-lined screen when preparing the cylinders.
The final chapter
On completion of the trials, the Goebel AG machine was delivered to the Government Printing Works at Pretoria,
together with the cylinders used. These were found to be too badly worn for further use and new cylinders had to
be prepared for the first issue of the Id ship stamp printed by rotogravure. The first stamp issued was on 1 May
1930. (Early reports and statements refer to April 1930, but the current Handbook/Catalogue gives the date as 1
May 1930.)
Had the original cylinders been used, it would not have been possible to identify easily the issued stamp, from
those trials printed on 'official' watermarked paper (Dix listings No 34 & 57). With new cylinders, however,
certain minor characteristics in the printing make separation possible.
The Listings
The listings as prepared by Professor Dix are maintained in edited versions, adding additional detail and variations
now identified (see Tables following).

The numbering is that given by Dix and taken from the Hunter-Penrose portfolio, which was not arranged in chronological order. The items identified as being printed on watermarked paper relate to paper bearing a clover leaf (or trefoil) pattern, supplied by Samuel Jones & Co Ltd, London.
Only two trials of the complete stamp were printed on 'Official' watermarked paper, that bearing the pattern
of multiple Springbok's head (Dix No 57 & 34).

Positive identification of the trials printed from the replacement cylinders is possible only from examples of the frame-plate and complete stamp and then just from the four corner stamps of each sheet (Figure 6). The new cylinders were prepared with a changed alternate language setting. In the original frame cylinder comprising 240 images set in pairs with alternate Afrikaans and English language inscriptions (20 rows of 12), the first stamp in the sheet has the Afrikaans inscription whereas the replacement cylinder has the first stamp with an English inscription (Figure 7).
