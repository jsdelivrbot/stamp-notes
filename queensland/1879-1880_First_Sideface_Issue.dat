\chapter{First Sideface issue}

The first sideface issue is one of the most interesting issue of Queensland as it was the first stamps produced by the surface-printing process and they are important because the methods developed in their production remained unchanged for the following twenty years.\footnote{A. R. Butler, Queensland 1897-80, \textit{London Philatelist}}.

It was in 1876 that a decision was taken by thePostal Authorities to replace the `Chalon Head' stamps. The design has been since 1860 and with the exception of the Fourpence which was lithographed all had been printed from the steel plates engraved by Perkins, Bacon Ltd in London. 

The new stamps were to be surface printed and fter Mr Knight, the Government Printer, had visited Sydney and Melbourne for advice it was decided to print them from locally made plates.

William Bell of Sydney was asked to engrave a master die on steel but this did not materialize until May 1877. The stamps did not materialize until April 1879 and it is the happening of the intervening two years which are of great interest.

\section{Production Method}

Once a master die is produced it will have to be reproduced in order to produce a full plate. This was done by the then new process of electrolytic deposition. In its simplest form the procedure was as follows. The master die was positioned on an appropriate sized flat slab of lead and then pressure was applied so that an impression of the design was transferred to the lead. The impression was then delicately polished with plumbago and a very soft brush. The slab of lead which has now become a mould was suspended in a bath of copper sulphate solution opposite to a similarly suspended plate of pure copper and an electric current applied. This caused a layer of copper to be deposited on the mould and this layer slowly increased in thickness. When the thickness was about that of a playing card the mould was removed from the bath.

The copper layer or shell was carefully separated from the mould and backed up with type metal. This then was an electrotype of the master die and because of the copper deposition had been of molecular fineness the detail of the design was precisely copied. It had however taken three days to form the copper shell and as the intention was to print from a plate of 120 subjects the first step to speed things up was to attempt to make a quadruple electrotype.

Four individual moulds were made ensuring by use of the drop hammer that the depth of impression was the same for wach one. The four moulds were then placed face downwards on a flat surface and soldered together. After cleaning and polishing this quadruple mould was put into the copper sulphate bath and a quadruple shell produced. This again was backed up with type metal and probably looked like the mode shown above.
