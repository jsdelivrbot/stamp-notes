## Chalon Issues 1860

The first issue of Queensland follows those of the other territories and portraits the
Chalon Head of Queen Victoria. These are best collected with cerificates. We use
the Stanley Gibbons catalogue for description of colours and values (2012). Condition is paramount to value.
