## Chalon Issues 1860
We now come to the issue of the first distinctive Queensland stamps.
On February 1st 186o, written instructions were sent to London for a supply
of special stamps for the Colony. It was requested that the stamps should bear
an effigy of the Queen's head in the centre, with the word " Queensland " at the
top and the value below. The design for the Queen's head to be similar to that
used for the Tasmania stamps and the whole to be carefully engraved to give a
good appearance and prevent forgery. Five values were required, viz. 1d., 2d.,
3d., 6d. and 1/-, also a registered stamp.

The order also asked for the earliest possible delivery and gave the numbers
required.

The order for the new stamps was entrusted to Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co.
The first consignment was despatched by overland mail on June 22nd, 1860,
and consisted of 600 sheets of 240 One Penny stamps imperforate, the price
charged being 9d. per 1000.

On July 17th, 1860, a second consignment was invoiced consisting of :—

\begin{tabular}{lll}
48,000 &6d. &green imperforate\\
28,800 &2d. &blue\\
19,200 &2d. &blue perforated\\
56,000 &1d. &red\\
\end{tabular}

The number of One Penny was made up of 233 sheets of 240 and one part
sheet of 80. It would be interesting to know what became of the other part of
the sheet.

The charge for perforating was 4d. per 1000 and for printing 9d. per 1000. The
invoice also charged up : " For engraving die roller, etc., and engraving 3 folio
plates of 240 designs for id., 2d. and 6d., at 105 Pounds each . . . . £315 0 0d."

It had been requested that all should be perforated, but there was not
sufficient time to do the work, as the mail had to be caught, and so part were sent
off imperforate. Perkins, Bacon were then instructed to supply as early as possible
15,000 3d. stamps.

The 1d., 2d. and 6d. stamps were received in the Colony early in October and
supplies were sent out to the various post offices on October 11th, with instructions
that they were not to be issued until November 1st, and that on and after that
date only Queensland stamps were to be used, and that they were to forward to
Brisbane all unused N.S.W. stamps in their possession to be exchanged for an
equal number of the new stamps. They were, however, to continue the use of
the N.S.W. registered stamps.

On August i6th, Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. invoiced the plates for the i/-
value and the registered stamp and also charged up :—

120,000 6d. stamps
24,000 2d.
15,000 1/-  (this included one half sheet)
18,000 registered stamps

—All perforated—

On September iyth a further consignment of:—
138,000 2d. stamps
82,000 6d. „
12,000 registered stamps

Again all were perforated.
This completed the order received, except for the 3d. value.
On December I5th, Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. invoiced the 3d. plate :
" Also printing 62 sheets of 240—15,000 at gd., and perforated same at 4d.
per 1000."

The above supplies were expected to last for two years, but it was soon found
that they would be insufficient, and on January I5th, 1861, an order was sent for
a further supply of 120,000 One Penny and 240,000 Two Penny stamps, and
later a request was made for further supplies, viz. : 120,000 id., 240,000 2d.,
15,000 3d., 120,000 6d., 30,000 1/-, 
 
30,000 registered. These were the last that
were ordered from England.
In 1862 all the plates were sent out to the Colony and from that time onwards
the stamps were printed locally.

Two varieties of paper were used by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co., viz. watermark
Large Star and watermark Small Star, and there are also varieties of the
perforation, one consignment of 1d. and 2d. stamps having been perforated at
Somerset House by one of the Napier comb machines, giving a clean-cut 14
perforation. As the spacing did not properly fit the machine, well-centred copies
of this perforation are scarce. All the other perforated stamps were done by
Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. and by one machine, but in the case of the early
consignments a clean-cut perforation was the result, while in the later consignments
the pins of the machine had got so clogged up and worn that a rough
perforation was the result. 
 
\section{THE DESIGN FOR THE STAMPS.}

This was certainly taken from the portrait of Queen Victoria in her State
robes painted by A. E. Chalon, R.A., about 1838. There seems to be some doubt
as to whether the actual engraving was done by William Humphrys or Charles
Henry Jeens, and Mr. Bradbury, who made a study of the matter, came to the
conclusion that it was the work of Humphrys but that Jeens may have assisted
by finally touching up the die before it was put into use, both men being in the
service of Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co at that time.
