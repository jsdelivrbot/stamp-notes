\chapter{1880 Half-Penny Provisional}


The Halfpenny on One Penny was made necessary by the increase in Newspaper rate from 1d to 1\half d. It is recorded as being supplied to the Post Office on 21 February 1880 and as the rate reverted to 1d on 28 February its rarity used is understandanble. Only 170 sheets of 120 stamps each of the One Penny were overprinted which makes the Halfpenny QO flaw of Queensland a major rarity. \annotate{something}

The half penny provisional is extremely rare used and in blocks. The stamps are normally found badly perforated and it is likely that these were from unissued stocks that were kept aside to be disposed. The Stanley Gibbons catalogue distinguishes between the two dies SG 151/151a, whereas the Scott catalogue does not.
