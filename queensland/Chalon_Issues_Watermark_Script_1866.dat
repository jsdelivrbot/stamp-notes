## Chalon Issues Watermark Script

Special paper was then brought into use with the word " Queensland " in
script capitals and the words " Postage Stamps " twice repeated. This was
designed to cover the whole sheet.
During November 1865 480,000 id. and 2d. stamps were printed on this
paper. \footnote{George Ginger, London Philatelist, 1933}

During 1866 the Colony went through a period of very severe trade depression
and the towns and cities were crowded with unemployed men. The Government
had to have recourse to the issue of £i and £5 Treasury notes and all this special
watermarked paper was used up for that purpose. The stamps on the Script
paper were all perforated 13.

In 1866 stamps of the value of 4d. and 5/- were required and these were
produced in the Colony by taking lithographic transfers from the 3d. and 1/-
stamps and erasing the values from the stones and drawing in the new values.

The records would assume that the transfers were taken from the whole sheet,
which would mean that there are actually 240 minor varieties of each, but I
think this is very doubtful indeed, as it is usual to only take a transfer from a
comparatively small number of designs, and then repeat these upon the stone as
many times as may be required. This is a matter which philatelists ought to
solve
