\chapter{Stamps Printed in the Colony}
We now come to the stamps which were printed in the Colony. In 1851, the
Government, having set up their own printing office, decided to print their own
stamps and a request was sent to London for all the plates, with a sufficient
supply of paper, etc. The first printing was done at the end of 1862 and consisted
of 27,360 2d. stamps and 64,800 1d..stamps, the actual date of delivery being
December 16th, 1862.

For some reason or other the special Star watermarked paper sent from London
was not used, but a soft unwatermarked paper which, however, gave a very clear
impression of the design. This first printing of the id. was in a peculiar shade
of Indian red which was never repeated. The stamps in this shade are rather
scarce. Subsequent printings were in quite a different colour, being shades of
bright orange-vermilion.
In the early part of 1863, 175,200 id. and 376,000 2d. were printed. Copies
of the id. vermilion and 2d. blue may be found on medium hard greyish wove
paper, but these belong to the later issue on Script watermarked papers, such
copies having escaped the watermark.
On April J7th, 1863, the first lot of locally printed 6d. stamps was delivered
to the post offices ; the colour was a pale yellow-green, but a few are known in
a bluish-green shade and also in full green. The total printed was 240,000.
On July i4th, 1863, the first instalment of i/— stamps was issued to the
offices. These were in a grey colour and again on unwatermarked paper. The
first local delivery of 3d. stamps was on September ist, and consisted of 120,000.
The colour was brown, of a lighter and more yellowish shade than the London
prints.
There were additional printings of the id., 2d. and 6d. during the year 1863.
All these stamps on unwatermarked paper were perforated by the Government
printers. They had two machines, one was a single-line machine gauging 13—13 J,
this was the one most generally used, and a number of sheets were usually
perforated at the same operation and the effect was very similar to a pin perforation.
Specimens may be found with very small clean holes and it is thought
these were from sheets which were perforated singly and when the machine was
in good order. The second machine was a single-line perforation gauging about
12 J and had only a length of i2| inches. This gave larger holes of a square-lookingtype.
This machine was only brought into use occasionally and was used for
the horizontal rows only, and thus we get the compound perforations.
