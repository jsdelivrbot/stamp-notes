##Introduction

QUEENSLAND was originally the northern part of New South
Wales and was known as the Moreton Bay district.
On May 13th, 1859, the new Colony of Queensland was
created by Royal Letters Patent.
The first Governor, Sir George Fergusen Bowen, arrived at
Brisbane on December 10th, 1859, and immediately proclaimed
the new Colony.

The postal accounts began on December 1st, 1859, and from that time the
new Colony benefited from all postal revenues and was, of course, responsible
for all payments. The existing stocks of N.S.W. stamps were taken over and it
was decided to order further supplies from the New South Wales Government;
these to be supplied at cost price. It therefore follows that all N.S.W. stamps
used in the Colony after December 1st, 1859, are Queensland provisionals. The
price fixed by the Postmaster of New South Wales for the supply of stamps to
Queensland was 1/4\half d per 1000, but this was for imperforate stamps, the Queensland
Government not wishing to pay an additional charge for perforating them.

The first stamps of Queensland were issued on 1 November 1860. Before that, Queensland used the stamps of [New South Wales from 1851](../queensland/New_South_Wales_used_in_Queensland). These stamps can only be distinguished from their cancellations.


All of Queensland's postage stamps portrayed Queen Victoria. Between 1 January 1880 and 1 July 1892, revenue stamps of 1866-1892 were authorised for postal use.
